#### This is a new Readme for the Scripting News repo

I am using the new English editor to work on this.

But it's missing some capabilities, that's why I'm not editing the actual readme file, yet.

Let's see if this works! :-)

#### Todo list

*   The commit message is pretty random. Needs to be settable in the editor, not a constant on the server.
*   Need more than one size headline. Right now we just have an H4.
*   A link from the editor to the page in the repo.
