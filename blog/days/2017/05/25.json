In the 90s, we talked a lot about Microsoft's efforts to eat the web, which were prodigious, futile and more than a little evil. Paul is what I think of as a no-bullshit reporter. He asks the question that's obvious that most reporters either don't think of or don't have the guts to ask. Really aren't many of them. I want Paul to get back in the saddle, with a blog. I was very clear and open with that wish as people who know me surely must understand by now. ;-)",
