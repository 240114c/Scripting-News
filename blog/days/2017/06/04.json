Haha. But they did it. It really does make sense in a science fiction way. If you accept the premise that 2 percent of the population could disappear in an instant, and if you watched the show all the way to the end you had to accept it, then you can certainly accept the resolution, the explanation of how it balances, the symmetry of it. They even showed you the symmetry, with Nora's story, the one character for whom it made sense to make a round trip.",

In hindsight it seems so obvious. And I spent some time thinking about it. At least the 30 or so hours I've spent watching episodes. ",
