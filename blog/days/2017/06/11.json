It gets a lot of data about the people who use it. I might have thought twice, might not even have installed it, if I had known it was a front for Facebook. Funny thing, when you go to the App Store, it <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/11/movesInAppStore.png\">doesn't tell you</a> there either. How is a user supposed to know that this innocuous app is actually a tentacle of the Internet's octopus. ",

The realtime technology is now ready, it seems. I'm thinking of a personal Twitter, a fractional horsepower Facebook. It's time to stop waiting for them to listen. Listening is not one of their core competences. They haven't figured out how to scale listening. There aren't any hackathons for listening. They have yet to discover a business model for listening. You can't break things fast while listening. Got any other tech cliches to bust? ",
