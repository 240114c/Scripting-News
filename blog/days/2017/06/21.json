It also says our software is dog food. I think as a kid, as an experiment, a few of us kids actually ate dog food. It's a vague memory, that must have some basis in reality. It makes me nauseous to think about it. And that's what I think about when I hear the term. Please, let's find another way of saying \"My software is good because I use it, and vice versa.\"",

That's fine, but you have to look elsewhere too, because as he's discovered, they only embrace part of the open web. It's too bad they chose such an inclusive name, but have an exclusive approach. For example, they have avoided \"RSS\", for reasons I'm sure I don't understand (I've listened, so no need to repeat the reasoning). We need all the advantages we can get because there are <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/06/18.html#a090658\">serious</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/10/03/turnsOutLessFacebookIsOk.html\">headwinds</a> these days for blogging.

For reading, I encouraged Richard to look at \"Electric River\", it's the closest to what Radio UserLand did with aggregation in 2002. It runs on your Mac desktop, as the original did. When he wants to go all-in with rivers, nothing can take the place of \"River5\", which is getting both modular and deep. I'm doing more work on that. Rivers have not finished evolving as far as I'm concerned. ",
