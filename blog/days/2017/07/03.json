I don't think the video of Trump body slamming <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=Trump+body+slamming+CNN&ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch\">CNN</a> is inciteful of anything. It's the equivalent of a cartoon on the editorial page of a news site. I don't see what the big deal is. It would be totally different if he was aiming it at a specific person. On a scale of 1 to 10 of offensiveness I'd rate it a 1.5. Kathy Griffin's bloody severed <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/kathy-griffin-apologizes-for-photo-with-bloody-trump-head.html\">Trump head</a> would be an 8 or 9, because that's a <i>person's</i> head, not a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZkjJbXMDZI\">symbol</a> of a corporation.
