That's the politics of division. That's the problem right there. We need to start listening, to everyone. Because you never know who your newest ally will be. I don't like Greenwald, it's true, and it's because he is one of the worst listeners I've ever encountered. Totally self-contained. Greenwald knows the truth, and can't learn anything from anyone. (My politics and his are pretty well aligned btw, which I know from reading his columns.)",
