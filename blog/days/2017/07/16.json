As part of the thinking I did a <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+sarcasm&t=hq&ia=web\">search</a> for the word on my blog to see how it has come up over the years. I always disclaim it, either way, if I think people will mistake sincerity as sarcasm, or if I want to be sure people know I'm being sarcastic. I think sarcasm usually just gets in the way and is only funny to the person saying the words, so just be sarcastic with yourself, enjoy a good laugh, and avoid the grief.",
