Good idea. Perhaps go the next step, find thoughtful people everywhere to write about what's wrong with the world, and listen. A lot is lost when you have to explain things through reporters. We're limited by what they understand. As a result events fly by without much understanding. ",

I knew I had a contact lens floating around somewhere in my right eye, outside my vision. I couldn't feel where it was, and no amount of tweaking would get it to re-center. So finally I decided it must have fallen out, and put in a second lens. Then I could <i>really</i> feel something was wrong. So I took out the second lens and miraculously the one I thought had fallen out came back into view, and my vision was back to where it was supposed to be. But I wondered what I would do if I never found the first lens and had to live with the possibility that I had it floating around inside there, getting infected and fused and whatever contacts lost in your body do.
