Each has a 1TB limit, but actually use less than 100GB. The servers update files a lot, so there's lots of traffic on my Dropbox account. I don't begrudge them $200 a year. They provide a lot of service for the money.",

So I bought a 5TB external drive, and put everything vital on it, including my Dropbox folder. That was probably a mistake. Because you can hear that drive doing its thing all the time night and day. And then the machine started getting slow. Again. Rainbow cursors. Just like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY60vzAWqxw\">Mac ad</a> that shows the PC going to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland\">Never-Land</a>, except it's my Mac that's doing it. Programming or writing under these circumstances is like having random <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=senior%20moment\">Senior Moments</a>, which I unfortunately now have for real (I'm 62). A random computer-induced Senior Moment. Ugh. Just what I need! (Not.)",

Cackling really. This is what happens when you get old. Your mind and body fall apart but your sense of humor gets really sharp! God is merciful. Also the programming project I'm working on is truly wonderful. Open source software makes all kinds of things possible. ",
