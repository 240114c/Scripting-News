I had used a picture of a frog in a suit in the right margin of yesterday's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/09/01.html\">edition</a>, and I didn't know what book it came from. I got the image from the archive of Scripting News. Sometimes I just look through <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+public&t=h_&iar=images&iax=1&ia=images\">images</a> I've used before based on concept, and see what pops up. On Twitter, Debra Scherer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schererforever/status/904158368415313921\">suggests</a> the character might be from <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5659.The_Wind_in_the_Willows\">Wind in the Willows</a>, a book I must have read as a child. He could be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Toad\">Mr Toad</a>. Regardless there are some outstanding <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22wind+in+the+willows%22&t=h_&iax=1&ia=images\">images</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wind-Willows-illustrations-Arthur-Rackham-ebook/dp/B00ZE3M9FM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1504404748&sr=1-1&keywords=wind+in+the+willows\">book</a>, and I hope to use many of them as decorations here.
