The most shocking realization when I did <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/03/01/juryduty.html\">jury duty</a> was that I was the jury. I had spent so much time reading and watching courtroom dramas that it snuck up on me that the body of the trial was in my own body. After years of tweeting at and about presidents, I don't think <i>El Orange</i> has yet realized he's the guy in the hot seat. ",

Whenever a new item came in or was updated, I ran a bit of magic jQuery code that caused all links to open in an external window, outside the Electron context. If you let the app run for a while, one click would open five tabs (same link five times). Eventually one click would open 1000 tabs. The problem was fixed by adding a single line of code, to unregister the click handler before re-registering it, assuring that there's only one handler for each link. Here's the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/b7234a0840112217c0945cd92acf8acd\">new code</a>. ",
