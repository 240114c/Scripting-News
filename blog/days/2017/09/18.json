You're basically part a human <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)\">load-balancer</a> for bike stations. There's an app that shows you which stations need bikes and which have too many. If you move a bike for them, you get reward points. With enough points you can give friends (visiting from out of town for example) free days of Citibike. I'm exactly the kind of person to pitch this to. I'll do anything to get more people on the bike paths in NYC.  ",

You learn to ask questions and listen instead of assuming you know what the other person is thinking. I say that because I'm pretty sure some people never, in their whole lives, understand why every conversation they have ends up in frustration and anger. Not only would it make the world work better, but I think there would be more happiness.",
