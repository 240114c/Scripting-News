I was a healthy person subsidizing sick people until I needed life-saving heart surgery 15 years ago. Because of a sequence of COBRA, RomneyCare and ObamaCare, I have been insured ever since. Each year because of my age, I pay huge premiums. At times as much as $1500 a month with high dedictibles. In the interim, each year I used a fraction of that amount of health care. In other words as a person with a pre-existing condition (the definition of not healthy) I have been subsidizing sick people who need more health care than I do, and am happy to do it. ",

They play the same ugly game with voter suppression (they <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/heritage-explains/voter-fraud\">call</a> it something else). And unmasking. I guess they must have been masked for a reason, you say. To protect someone. And to unmask them, well that's obviously bad, right? Haha. You fell for it. Even when you argue against it, saying it's harmless, you're falling for it. Maybe the best thing is to play along? Why were they masked in the first place? What were they hiding? Maybe you have to play the game to defuse it. Bottom line -- Repubs are scum. If you're a Repub and don't feel you're scum, maybe it's time to start something new. ",

The purpose of therapy is to help you discover yourself. I know that sounds dorky and new-age-y, but it is literally what you're doing. You're bouncing around the world, looking for answers everywhere but the only place that can provide them, inside yourself. But if you don't know you exist, how can you find that place? A therapist patiently shines the light on that space, over and over, hoping that this year, or maybe next, you'll figure it out. ",
