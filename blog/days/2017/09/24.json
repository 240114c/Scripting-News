Never know when a standard might take root. :rocket: :boom:",

There are no checks and balances to stop him from firing missiles. Even climate change and repealing health care are insignificant threats compared to nuclear war. ",

I even unfriended one person because it's just too fucking offensive. People lose it when it comes to this topic. Yes we are mostly men. And we work really hard to do stuff to please you. And if you want to help I'm pretty sure most programmers will create plenty of space for you to do that. I certainly will. We're mostly  nice people. Yes there are assholes. But there are asshole women too. But for god's sake the programmers aren't in general the sexual harassers. We're fairly meek people. So stop shooting with such imprecision. Focus on the problem.  ",

What happens if the people don't walk out of the stadium when the players take a knee. It's one thing when he bluffs a foreign country and they know it, but now he's bluffing us. ",
