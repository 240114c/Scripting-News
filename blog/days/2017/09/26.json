The flag is a good fight for Trump, he picked his foil, strong, young, virile, violent black men, telling his fans that the people they're rooting for in the NFL don't respect the flag or them. This is a must-read. ",

It was programming. In other words, he agrees with Frum. We have left the domain of Black Lives Matter, and are playing on the racists' turf now. Not a good place to be. ",
