Listened to a bunch of podcasts including two Sunday news shows. Conclusion: the best Republican liar is Tillerson. That guy is slick. I didn't hate his lies. But Lindsey Graham and Netanyahu, they just plain out lie, no spin. Insulting to the intelligence of the listener. I can see why Trump likes them. ",

I wasn't going to backtrack to get coffee. They have it now. I wanted to pick up groceries before checking in. I searched for groceries, it gave me a chance to search on my route. It presented a list of choices along with how much time they'd add to my trip. A button next to each one offered to add it as a stop. Smooth as silk. Another bonus, Google Maps says \"Welcome to New Mexico\" a mile or so before you see the official sign. It was a surprise and made me laugh. I guess what's next is the Google Home interface for the Maps app.",

It has become the Visicalc of podcasts. I think everyone is listening to it. I don't miss an episode. He of course talked about the famous interview with the coal miner, but left out the best part, the thing he got dinged for the most (at least of what I heard) -- not challenging the guy on his opinion that coal didn't cause climate change. I totally supported that. I wanted to hear the guy's story and have the interviewer just let him say his piece. We know the arguments. It wouldn't have added anything to the story. Also, he defines the Daily as a podcast about the reporters who report the news. And the Longform interview was a podcsat about the podcast about the reporters who report the news. I wondered if another level is possible, but for now I couldn't imagine it. ",

The deal Obama did with Iran wasn't just about the military, it opened up Iran to the rest of the world, and as you might expect from an intelligent population of an ancient civilization, they are rebooting. The theory is that the hardliners will have more trouble being jerks internationally if their citizens are bringing home lots of money trading with the rest of the world. It's a theory that works. It's why what Trump is doing is so wasteful and sets us back. It's not <i>just</i> about nukes.  ",

Some of them make great movies like The Shining, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption. This one is promising.  ",
