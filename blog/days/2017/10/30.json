I recorded this <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/10/30/aPodcastForMarco.m4a\">10-minute podcast</a> to explain what I had in mind, generally, not about specific products (it was a long time ago, the opportunity long-since passed). Most of the time when you knock on the door saying <i>here's a free idea,</i> people think you want something. But sometimes it goes somewhere and that's when really interesting stuff happens. This is worth talking about. ",

Also the Knicks were great last night. We have some really tall players and as a result the defense is kind of working. It's a surprisingly good team, and fun to watch. ",
