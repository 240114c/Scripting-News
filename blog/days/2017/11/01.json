It's one of my three favorite rides. It was cold yesterday, and I had an errand to do on the east side, so I walked instead of riding. But I know the path well, esp the segment where the truck driver mowed down the pedestrians and cyclists. But here's the thing -- there weren't supposed to be any pedestrians there. It's a <i>bike</i> path. There's a much nicer walkway about 50 feet west of the bike path, right on the Hudson River. Cyclists aren't allowed there. I love that segment of the walkway, in fact it's often my turnaround spot, where I stop, take in the scene, sometimes even take a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/36654661212/in/dateposted-public/\">picture</a>. But please walkers and runners, stay in your space and we'll stay in ours. ",
