Six Feet Under one of my #5's is rated 2.8. Bojack is #77? That can't be right! And Star Trek Discovery, which I have not watched, that everyone raves about is #98. It's still very early, but some programs have as many as 60 votes. Top 5: The Wire, Breaking Bad, Claudius, West Wing, Band of Brothers. ",

The church is gone, the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4114991,-122.106259,3a,75y,103.11h,75.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2GuEo7y3_hdPAoo7SG5wnw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656\">land</a> is probably now part of a Google sub-campus. It was kind of a slum of an office, but it worked, it got us to the next stage, a suite of offices on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4316662,-122.1039337,3a,75y,121.42h,79.47t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sFT4lOwTmFFeDlVPVk8u4tQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DFT4lOwTmFFeDlVPVk8u4tQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D97.83552%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656\">Elwell Court</a> in Palo Alto, near the golf course and airport. The problem with the first office was that the windows didn't open and I was a smoker and they let you smoke in offices back then, even if the windows didn't open. So we made sure that the Elwell Court office had windows that opened. It was our top feature request. Then, we kept growing, and the next office was a standalone <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4203375,-122.0956367,3a,75y,125.35h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skMKj9NTMi-wniFPnqIiMkw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DkMKj9NTMi-wniFPnqIiMkw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D131.76736%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656\">building</a> on Charleston Road in Mountain View.

So we elected someone even worse, who is proceeding to break the economy even more. We're going to need someone better than Obama to fix it, if it's possible. Also, don't expect the next president to be like Trump. It doesn't work that way. He or she will be total Establishment. A real intellect. Not flamboyant or a narcissist. He or she will have other flaws, that we will have by then forgotten to watch out for. ",
