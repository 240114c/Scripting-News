It's nice, but so far, three episodes in, it's not as great as the reviews say. I'd say it's about 3/5th of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)\">Deadwood</a>, which came first, was more depraved, and more entertaining. That said I was just in the part of the country that it's about, southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. I think it was filmed there too. And this gives me a clear picture of what's next for \"BingeWorthy\", a diary, a place where I can take notes about programs as I work through them. ",

At least when you're at the dentist you know when the drilling is going to start. (Update: I found that putting on my Bose headphones helps a lot. Hard to believe the noise cancelling function is working. The drilling seems very far away. Only downside is I can't hear my fingers on the keyboard.) ",
