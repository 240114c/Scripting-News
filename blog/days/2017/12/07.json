Lots of sites have conditions at the ski areas. I want to know where the weather is. Mainly just a question of the storm track and what's coming. I suppose I could look at weather forecasts for each ski area, but that's pretty labor intensive. What I want is the overview. Any suggestions?",

We have principles in this country to uphold. Just walking away makes it that much more of a problem for the next man who is accused. Don't make a clich√© out of <i>the presumption of innocence. </i>It's an important <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence\">principle</a>.
