Instead of saying <i>reported</i> she says <i>reported out. </i>I think the extra word is not needed, it doesn't do anything. Maybe once a month it would be okay for emphasis, sort of like \"she reported the heck out of that\" meaning a sort of extreme reporting like scuba diving or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/world/asia/china-daredevil-skyscraper.html?_r=0\">rooftopping</a>. But when you always say it, it would seem to lose all meaning. Unless it means something that I just am not aware of. I wouldn't say anything if other people on MSNBC weren't starting to say it. They are.",

The Google movies page was plain and simple, took no time to load. And it did the most important thing, that Rotten Tomatoes also does -- you can view by movie or by theater. So if you feel like going uptown, you can see what's playing, or if you're looking for a showtime for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Bird_(film)\">Lady Bird</a>, you can do that too, across all the theaters it's playing in.",
