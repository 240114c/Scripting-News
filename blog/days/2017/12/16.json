Even if only in an archive.org backup. ",

I realized that there are two episodes in the middle of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME2umFQ_xBA\">season 2</a> of The Crown that I hadn't seen. Some kind of glitch in the new Roku? Whatever, it's kind of embarassing, but actually cool. I hadn't seen the episode with the great Elizabeth <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ME2umFQ_xBA?t=1m45s\">line</a>. \"There is no possibility of my forgiving you. The question is how on earth can you can forgive yourself.\" The thing that alerted me was reading a story about the actress who played Jackie Kennedy. What? And the quote from her is amazing, I never would have forgotten it. So now I get to watch two great episodes I hadn't seen. No wonder in my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/12/14.html#a171842\">review</a> of the series I said \"It's a little confusing as new characters are introduced without explanation.\" That was actually a bug report, though I didn't know.",

Or they say the deficit is bad, that's why we have to cut spending, or the middle class deserves a tax cut, even though we were just told (on MSNBC) that the tax cut isn't for the middle class. They must pay for these ads because they're worth it. They must sow some doubt in liberal news-watchers. ",
