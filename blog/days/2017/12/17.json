There's a toxic atmosphere around this topic. People mistakenly see other points of view as abuse. They're just ideas! If you disagree, disagree. It's cool. But don't make people shut up. You can't show them they're wrong if they don't speak, and you might find you're wrong about some things too. You don't solve problems that require cooperation by making people scared to speak. ",

One of the episodes was worth noting, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/12/the-crown-recap-season-2-episode-8.html\">episode 8</a>, where Queen Elizabeth meets Jackie Kennedy.
