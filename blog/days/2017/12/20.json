I really like these, esp the app that configures the set. I'm charging it up now, then I'll go out and try them in the real world. One thing -- they're lighter on the head than the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/12/04.html#a213202\">Bowers & Wilkins PX</a>, which I decided to keep. The sound was the reason. Really rich and deep and powerful. I've never owned headphones that can do this. Consistent with my motto, if the world is going to end, I might as well have some nice headphones. ",

Starting in 2018. With controls on speech on the net, so we won't be able to tell each other what's happening. It's all pretty easy to do, if they have the will, and what we're finding out now is that they do. Still, so much dreaming about the rule of law still applying. We won't know if it does until we need it, really need it. I suspect it won't be there. ",
