With Kyrie Irving as the point guard the Cavs made it to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals#2015%E2%80%93present:_Cavaliers%E2%80%93Warriors_rivalry\">finals</a> three times and won one title. So if Thomas gets the Cavs to the finals, so what. Where's the upside. With the Celtics, they had a goal. Rise to new glory. A newly reborn franchise. A worthy cause. Now he's on a reboot, where he belongs, with tons of upside and a chance to shine as a team leader instead of LeBron's sidekick. Everyone who plays alongside LeBron will have the same problem. Makes you wonder what LeBron's next move will be after this season with Cleveland, win or lose.",

It's one of my pet peeves, that it's hard to tell when a story was published. The info was on my story pages, but it was in the footer, and it was the last time the page was built. Not good enough. Now you can tell when a story was written, and it's up front where it belongs. ",
