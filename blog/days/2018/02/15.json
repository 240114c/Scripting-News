For example, here's an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/15/eveLeonWeddingInvitation.png\">invitation</a> to my parents' wedding on Christmas Day 1953 at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Lane_Hotel_(Manhattan)\">Park Lane Hotel</a> in NYC. Interestingly it's not far from where I live today. Of course I wasn't even a twinkle in my father's eye at the time (I was born in 1955). By posting it here I hope to be able to find it in the future. BTW, my grandfather's name is listed on the invite as \"Rubin\" but no one called him that. He was Rudy and was the superstar celebrity of the family. My grandmother, Lucy, was the real power. I bought a domain to commemorate him, appropriately named <a href=\"http://rudykiesler.com/\">rudykiesler.com</a>. ",

There's no date on the ad, or on the article on the other side of the page. The ad looks a lot better than the scan. And the fine print didn't make it on the scan, so I did another <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/15/fineprint.png\">scan</a> with just that info. My signature, in 1985, had a lot of detail that's since been lost. Back then I did a lot more writing, so my handwriting was more important than it is now, where all my writing is done on a keyboard, and has been for decades. Also years of being a CEO and having to sign stacks of things did a number on my signature too. ",
