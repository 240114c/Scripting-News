If you go to a <a href=\"http://doc.blog/2018/02/21/aMorningMusicalDigression.html\">story</a> on Doc Searls' 1999.io blog, it adds the port the server is running on, 1999, to the URL and redirects to it. That's because nodeStorage is not running on port 80. That's a recent thing. I used to have it running on port 80, but I needed to use \"pagePark\" for other apps running on the machine, so I moved nodeStorage to port 1999. ",

When the request comes in for that address, it notices that there's a mapping from doc.blog to that sub-site, and redirects to it. It's pretty invisible, and a bit clever. I can't imagine someone else debugging this in the future and not being puzzled by it. (Hence this long comment.)",
