            "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhad_Manjoo\">Farhad Manjoo</a>, tech columnist for the NYT <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html\">wrote</a> about a hiatus he took from social media and how much he liked it. According to CJR, he actually <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/analysis/farhad-manjoo-nyt-unplug.php\">didn't</a> take a hiatus. Makes sense. How could a reporter not use Twitter these days? That's where news is made. ",

Because ISPs invisibly redirect download requests of popular programs to new versions with spyware added. Better: don't download an app that runs on your local computer from a site that isn't being served via HTTPS. But it doesn't follow that <i>sites that don't offer downloads</i> should be blocked. It's like saying drunk driving is dangerous and therefore all driving should be banned. Let's not break the web if we don't have to. ",
