I looked around, and most of the stories written by journalists are wildly innaccurate. Then I realized there's a better way to show the work. I archived the earliest podcasts so they'd be <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/03/07/theEarliestLydonPodcasts.html\">easily found</a>. This is imho the best anchor point. There's no question these are podcasts. They were a collaboration between <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html\">myself</a>, Chris Lydon and <a href=\"http://www.dtvgroup.com/Chris_Lydon/\">Bob Doyle</a>. There was important work that predated it, with myself and Adam Curry, and podcasting came together as a growing medium in the summer of 2004 after the DNC with the iPodder group, all independent of what we were doing at Harvard. But these podcasts, the BloggerCon sessions, and the Berkman Thursday meetups, all were central to the bootstrap. Others have managed to insert themselves into the story, they don't belong there. It's important, if we want to create more open media types, to tell the story accurately.",

He was peeved, for sure, and imho had every right to be. I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/974067062661439488\">asked</a> if this broke existing links, i.e. had he been using the feature (I assume so) and did the links still point to paragraphs on the NYT site (yes, of course they pointed there, but did the links work when clicked).
