I've been building and living in a house for 24 years. Some of the annexes are falling apart. Others have skeletal remains, and others have become porn sites because I forgot to go to City Hall and re-register the deed for that part of the property (a rule with no exceptions). Honestly, it's a mess. But the core house is fine. Lots of parties and dinners happen there, and we have great photos of them all lining the corridors. It's a huge house for one person, but I call it home. I like it. Then Google comes into the house, uninvited, and says that electricity is too dangerous. We're going to run on new kind of power in our world. I honestly never think about the electricity. What? They say you may not remember where all the wires are buried, but you must dig them up and replace them and rebuild your whole house from the ground up with the new system. Since this neighborhood doesn't support the new kind of power, Google continues, you'll have to move the whole thing, too. Hope you don't mind. Hold on a minute. Here's the thing -- I don't <i>have</i> to do what they say. I can go on living in the house and have parties just like before and stick with the original way of powering the place. Right where it is. No need to change neighborhoods. It's just that people who use the new Google-powered system will get a big warning when they come to visit. \"This place is awful,\" the warning will say. \"It has terrorists. If you go inside they'll probably kill you.\" To which I say, whatever. ",
