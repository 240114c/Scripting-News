Trump found someone who's even crazier than he is about going to war. Reminds me of the line in the old Woody Allen movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(1973_film)\">Sleeper</a>, where the main character, played by Allen of course, asks, 200 years in the future, how the world was destroyed. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ngizj5FIcjo?t=1m30s\">He's told</a> that someone named Albert Shanker got hold of a nuclear warhead. He only missed it by a generation. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Shanker\">Shanker</a> was the kind of NYC-famous person who terrorized the city, but people outside the city wouldn't likely have heard of him. That's Trump. Shanker never did get a nuclear weapon, it was ludicrous, but honestly, no more ludicrous than Donald Trump getting one, much less the entire nuclear arsenal of the United States. Which he did, and now, pretty clearly, plans to use.",
