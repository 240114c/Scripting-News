Back when I was doing all my server work in Frontier, I had a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/03/31/xml.rss.getFeedItems.png\">verb</a> that, given a URL, would parse a feed and return a struct. It did all the work behind a simple interface. When it came time to fix encoding in feedBase, I decided to invest in having it be that simple in Node. I have the new <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedRead\">package</a> running inside \"feedbase\" now. It seems to work. You're welcome to use it in your projects as well, of course. ",

Handle feeds that have special characters, such as feeds in German or Chinese, and merge duplicates, two or more URLs that point to the same feed. I'm going very slow with the changes. This is a long-term project, it's important to get it right. Very different from the first time around with \"RSS\" apps when everything was a rush. Also want to take a look at display on phones and tablets.

I often watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriMelber\">Ari Melber's</a> show on MSNBC, but when they turn to Facebook I get ready to be angry because they screw the story up so badly. Zuck pitched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev\">Medvedev</a> and China. He says he wants regulation but has lobbyists that worked against it. Great, you embarrass him, but the net-effect is they continue to destroy the open web. Why don't we work on something that really matters that isn't about Russia or doesn't feel like Watergate. Tech makes messes when companies get dominant. Finding things Facebook is <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/06/facebookAlreadyHasStylingAndLinks.html\">screwing</a> up is easy. But Melber and the rest of the folks in the mainstream press have not found it. Same with <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">Google</a>. ",
