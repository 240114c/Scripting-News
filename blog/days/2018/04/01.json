Uses new functionality of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread\">davefeedread</a>, so we should handle feeds that use different charsets. Also dereference the feed URL before adding a subscription. This should help eliminate duplicates. Still remaining -- use canonical URLs for existing subscriptions. I want to do that carefully because I'm still an SQL novice. ",
