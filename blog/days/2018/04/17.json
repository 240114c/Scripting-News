Ideally, they would let me have the list in OPML form. I suspect they do, but if so, it's not obvious esp to someone who would want the list in OPML, i.e. someone who is not a frequent Feedly user, such as yours truly. This is the problem with commercial vendors who build on open formats. They don't reciprocate. They consume the openness. This <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/468991-all-of-this-has-happened-before-and-it-will-all\">happened</a> before. Even better if they offered a dynamic link to the user's collection, so I could add the link to the OPML to my reader and if his collection changed I'd be updated. Remember the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3\">big idea</a> of the web, <i>people return to places that send them away. </i>Feedly is doing the opposite, trying to suck people in and hold them. This is the tech industry philosophy, and it will imho be its downfall.",

I think this is necessary, but this should be created and managed independent of the tech industry. News already looks to tech to be its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#Slang_terms\">sugar daddy</a> which leads to fawning coverage, and a huge conflict, at a time when tech is more in the news than ever, and deserving of scrutiny. Tech controlling news flow, especially Apple, which has little respect for criticism, free speech, spells the end of any semblance of independence of news. Also I'm hearing more that paywalls are seriously stifling the flow of news, at a time when we need <i>better</i> flow. Apple would not be good for that either. ",
