Next, let's ask Inoreader and NewsBlur to do so as well. Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">feed</a> to test with. This is an important <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=title-less+posts+site%3Ascripting.com&t=hy&ia=web\">historic</a> feature dating back to the origins of \"RSS\". Today, it's how blogging can grow into Twitter's space, without its limits (with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink\">linking</a>, <i>styles</i>, and no length limit). It was there before Twitter even existed, btw. If you look at the archive of my blog going back to the 90s you'll <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2001/07.html\">see</a> lots of titleless items. This is one of the ways Google Reader screwed up the blogging world, by refusing to support this required feature. Let's undo that mistake and grow our world. It's really <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howToDisplayTitlelessFeedItems.html\">easy</a>. :boom:",
