It's hypocritical of us to put down other people for feeling this way. Maybe we can listen better, and accept that other people find jarring what we find normal and remember when it felt jarring for us, and not hold it against them, as we wouldn't want it to be held against us. Had Joy Reid said that, I would be cheering her. ",
