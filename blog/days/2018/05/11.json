I'm concentrating my meager efforts to preserve my work, and they really are inadequate, on scripting.com. I should probably use a permanent redirect, but I am chicken, permanent redirects really are permanent these days. :boom:",

We should have mapped to one of my servers, where I did a permanent redirect to radio-weblogs.com, which points to the archive on Automattic. If you are left with the task of preserving a community of static sites, as I was, don't just point a CNAME at the site, have it pass through a redirect. That gives you the flexibility to, after a certain amount of time, make the mapping permanent. I didn't understand this when we originally did the mapping when I sold weblogs.com.",

They got a kick out of it. It was meant to be funny, like <a href=\"https://www.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds</a>. But what came out was one of the best summaries of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html\">what the Internet is</a>, what makes it important, and what needs to be preserved. In a way, a 2018 followup to JPB's <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\">declaration</a>. Main point: companies <i>must not</i> take on the role of governments. When they do, disaster results. A thoughtful company would realize this. All the companies say they are thoughtful. Perhaps they should think a bit more and take a step back. Apple must stop trying to hijack web links. Google must live with the flaws in HTTP. Facebook must care about preserving what's good about the web (links, styles, titles, podcasts). And Medium must take steps to preserve their user's writing outside a paywall. All of them would do better, long-term, if they didn't consume what's great about the web, rather invested in making it even better at doing what it does so miraculously well.",
