She had an ex-CIA guy on as <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/james-clapper-on-russia-they-swung-the-election-to-a-trump-win-1239786051725?playlist=associated\">the big guest</a>, he has a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fears-Hard-Truths-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B076GPMDTS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1527082847&sr=1-1&refinements=p_27%3AJames+R.+Clapper\">book</a> out. He says he believes, now that he's retired, that the Russians did influence the outcome of the election. Rachel paused, as if some big moment had passed. She seemed to be saying, aha now at last the truth has come out. I thought this is so laughably ridiculous. Of course <i>we all knew</i> that the Russians influenced the outcome of the election. This. Is. Not. News. Stop being so ridiculous Rachel. Let's move beyond what we all know. We all know what happened in 2016. Now let's put up some defenses against what's happening <i>now. </i>",

We still have a long way to go before the Constitution is gone, so the more we know about what's coming next, the more effective we can be at heading it off. In other words, what if we didn't panic and instead learned how to put up the best defense possible. This is especially relevant for tech people, because life in our totalitarian state will be more completely totalitarian than any before, thanks to the incredible spying devices we <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone/?afid=p238%7Cs6HPNxDZt-dc_mtid_20925d2q39172_pcrid_220885752408&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-iphone-slid--\">carry</a> in our pockets and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0749WVS7J/ref=s9_acsd_al_bw_c_x_2_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_r=7SHKS157YHYZVH6K94VH&pf_rd_r=7SHKS157YHYZVH6K94VH&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=6a747220-e57e-4f0f-8e80-7197dcb56327&pf_rd_p=6a747220-e57e-4f0f-8e80-7197dcb56327&pf_rd_i=9818047011\">install</a> in our homes, naïvely assuming they only have benign applications.

When they do so, they will inevitably come to the sincere, deeply held belief that culling the bottom 50% to 90% of the planetary population will give them a shot at survival in the post-greenhouse world.
