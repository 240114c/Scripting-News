It gave me an idea for <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/67fd46d35998a0beda354e638d563cbf#file-rpccall2-json\">another approach</a>. Basically, when JSON has a syntax for a type, just include the data (int, double, boolean, string, struct, array). When it doesn't, represent it with an object with two properties, #type and #value. The <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/67fd46d35998a0beda354e638d563cbf#file-rpccall2-json\">second example</a> illustrates this approach. ",
