Most of this email is threatening, blackmail. Very little about any benefit. Also <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">scripting.com</a> is my oldest site. The blog that started blogging. Older than Google itself. I am livid mad with this company that we used to love, that was born of the web. If you're not up on what they're doing, I wrote a <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">FAQ</a> for you. Please read and pass it along. The press isn't covering this for some reason. ",

The exceptions of course are Netflix and Amazon. I just finished Season 3 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot\">Mr Robot</a>, and having seen all ten episodes I have to say you would have had no idea what was coming and how good it would get based on the first few episodes. This was the season when Elliot and his sister Darlene become human. Find love. Accept their own flaws and their father's, the titular character. There's one scene in episode 6 when father and son are fighting in a totally <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/21/mrRobotFightingWIthElliot.png\">Mr Robot way</a>, and I laughed so hard, it was <i>so</i> well done. \"I guess he didn't like my note,\" says Elliot. Episode 8 with the young Iranian kid was so sweet, and it's when we learn Elliot cares about people and loves himself. This is new. Anyway, Season 2 was a disappointment, but Season 3 makes up for it. I may have to watch it again. ",

Of course I'm trying to topple the system not by hacking but by publishing. But the ideas are similar. And the next binge, Silicon Valley, is about what I used to do, before I hated that place. :boom:",
