What went wrong? We centralized a decentralizing technology, and of course that eventually broke. Google had no incentive to keep \"RSS\" afloat because it couldn't be turned into a silo. It's like politics and journalism. We <i>all</i> have to do it if we want it to work. Independent developers should have worked together better. And users could have chosen independent developers over the single big company, which turned out to be the point of failure. If we want the world to work -- journalism, tech and politics, the people have to consider the big picture in our small picture choices. ",
