They make it sound like installing the native portion is some huge deal. It's not. I would share what I have so far, but I just followed the instructions on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-sqlite3\">this page</a>. They work, and the demo app works. I have an interesting project in mind, but first I have to learn more about SQLite to see if it's feasible. Still diggin. :rocket:",

This is based on what I learned bootstrapping blogging and podcasting. The same ideas should work for journalism, at least as starting points. We have to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/06/30/122337.html\">work together</a>, and not wait for the tech industry to do it, imho. We can do it. Programmers can save the world.
