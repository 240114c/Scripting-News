This blog and all my other sites use HTTP. I don't see that changing. I expect this will make writing for the web more of a chore. That's life I guess. I don't want Google to be able to mold the web to its needs. I never signed on to being a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/06/13/142326.html\">Google developer</a>, and never would.

But that won't be the end of the tectonic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics\">plate shifts</a> in news.
