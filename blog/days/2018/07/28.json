You only need two levels of hoisting if you have... 2. A <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/28/crumbtrail.png\">crumb trail</a>, like directory websites have. It belongs in outliners (none of mine ever had them). 3. You don't even need a dehoist command if you have the crumb trail. Watch the video to see how it works. It's remarkably simple. :boom:",

Imagine in the next election the outcome is even more in doubt than it was in 2016. Most journalists don't know anything about tech. They studied history in college. They write about Facebook without even being users of Facebook. Not only is there no one home in the Oval Office, but it's even worse in JournalismLand. Remember last time around they were conned into believing that running one's own email server was nefarious. They are novices. (BTW, history is important. Don't want to diminish that.)",
