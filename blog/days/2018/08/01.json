It's a screen shot of \"Radio3\" -- the tool I use for linkblogging. It's amazing this has gotten almost no coverage in the press. It's like a tunnel under the Hudson was terminated, where FB is New Jersey and everything else is Manhattan (or vice versa, it doesn't matter).

I called the product <a href=\"http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf\">HighFiles</a>, for high level file system. That's how I thought of it. We found a copy of this document in my mom's house back in February. Finally got around to scanning it. It's a time capsule. Some ideas I didn't think I had that early, and some absolute <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shaking%20my%20head\">SMH</a> things, which I'm now putting on the record. I was only 24 back in 1979. :boom:",
