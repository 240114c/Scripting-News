It's not clear what will happen to the archives. Let's have a discussion about this. That was the first academic blog hosting system anywhere. It was where we planned and reported on our Berkman Thursday meetups, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon\">BloggerCon</a>. It's where the first podcasts were hosted. When we tried to figure out what makes a weblog a weblog, that's where the <a href=\"http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html\">result</a> was posted. There's a lot of history there. I can understand turning off the creation of new posts, making the old blogs read-only, but as a university it seems to me that Harvard should have a strong interest in maintaining the archive, in case anyone in the future wants to study the role we played in starting up these (as it turns out) important human activities.

That and Google's marking HTTP sites as <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">not secure</a> have been huge blows to the web as an archival medium. It's a good time to pause and reflect on the question of what was the value of all the work, and why bother continuing if the people who should care, a major university, a large research company and one of the largest tech companies, don't care about maintaining the web. What hope is there for it being maintained in the future?",
