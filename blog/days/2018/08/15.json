For some reason a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=bike+speaker\">search</a> on Amazon yielded nothing but crap, but if you know what you're looking for you get some pretty nice stuff. Rex Hammock recommended <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Waterproof-Portable-Bluetooth-Black/dp/B01MSYQWNY\">JBL Flip</a>. And Jason Gilman recommended <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MXDNA2O/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_-L1CBbV67GDBM\">Clearon</a>. Roland Tanglao <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1029534796957933568\">said</a> he loves his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B01FFV59PY\">UE Roll 2</a>, and I have one of those, but it didn't occur to me it could be bike-mounted. The bungee that's built in works fine on a bike, and I took it for a spin just now and it's perfect. Great sound. Totally loud enough to be heard over NYC street noise, with great frequency range and thumpin base to keep the wheels turning. A really great answer. Davey's a happy cyclist. Thanks everyone for the great advice. I want to try all of these speakers. ",

The problem journalism has is that it is at war with a formidable adversary, the head of the US government. It's time to consult with people who have studied war. I suspect they will say that 100 editorials wouldn't have had much impact on Japan or Germany at the beginning of World War II. We never would have thought to respond to the 9/11 attacks with 100 stinging editorials. When attacked in an outright and clear act of war, aim at the power of the enemy, analyze and develop our own power, and fight back, to win.",

It's smart. I pleaded with Obama to do exactly that when he took office in 2009. The web was ready to take Obama's message of intellectual and just government all around the world. Instead he stuck to norms. And ran head-on into a Republican blockade. Nothing could get him out of the Rose Garden and back on the campaign trail. ",
