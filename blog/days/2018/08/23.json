I'm in the fucking bike line, a cab is waiting, adjacent to the lane, for I don't know what, and just as I approach he starts to move across the lane. I yell five times WATCH OUT and he stops, and as I pass, I make eye contact and yell FUCK YOU BIKE LANE. In Madison or Palo Alto you'd say Yo how you doing, but in NYC the salutation is FUCK YOU. Everyone understands this except people visiting from Madison or Palo Alto of course. It's why I like NY so much. Fuck you, let's dispense with the niceties. He was probably a Yankees fan anyway.",

The only new feature that I can see is that there's a really stupid animation that makes me wait for Gmail's UI to show up. Mail is a very integral part of my work flow. If anything they should make it load <i>faster. </i>Making the load slower is imho inexplicable and indefensible. Another beautiful feature, where the star used to appear is now a trash icon. I just deleted a message I wanted to star. Oh that really makes sense. (Sarcasm.) Now an adventure to figure out where the fuck they put deleted messages so I can undelete it. It was important (which is why I was trying to star it).",

I did a little digging and found the software and the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/48\">thread</a> I wrote documenting the work. The idea is to use GitHub as a blogging database. So what I did was get an instance of <a href=\"https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor\">Medium-Editor</a> to edit stuff on GitHub. Couple that with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/githubpub\">GitHubPub</a> that maps subdomains on locations within GitHub repos, and you've got a nice dynamic blogging system with almost $0 hosting costs. Oh if only I had the time to chase down all these <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_Rabbit_Hole\">rabbit holes</a>. üêá",
