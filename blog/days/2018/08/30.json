A couple of days ago I was walking down a car ramp into a garage, here in Manhattan, unsure of where I was going so I was looking down at my iPhone studying the map. I also had a 30-pound pack on my back which made me more top-heavy than usual. I tripped over a speed bump, at first I thought I would be able to recover, but because of the weight of the pack and the downwards slope of the driveway, I was going down. I hit on both hands, my knee, somehow my side got involved and I hit my head. My hands took the worst of it. A little blood, mostly road-rash. Three strangers came to my aid, very nice people, and I was up and dusted off in a matter of seconds, horribly embarrassed, and in pain. It wasn't until hours later that I realized that if this happened a few years from now it could have been a lot worse. For now my whole body is sore. Reminds me of how I felt after a bike accident in NYC a few years back. This was nowhere near as bad. I told a friend I feel fragile. To look at me you might think that's ridiculous. But it's true. 63 ain't 23 or even 43. And I'm sure 73 will also be different. :boom:",

Surprising to me that I wanted to hear more about him, even though in life, I felt I knew all I wanted. I had mixed feelings about him. I <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mccain&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=site%3Ascripting.com+mccain&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.174685j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">remember</a> when he ran against Bush and first did great and then got whipped. He does do a good New Hampshire town hall. He likes to say how honest he is, but I heard him do a lot of lying, esp about the Iraq War. That's the worst. To let people call you honest, to call yourself honest, while you're lying. That's worse than just being a liar. Anyway, he was an interesting person. One thing he said in an interview in the mid-2000s is that we should repeal Roe v Wade and then have a great debate about it. I wanted the interviewer to ask him why we can't have the debate before repealing it? I can't imagine there's anything more to say that hasn't already been said a billion times. It's a morally ambiguous situation. No amount of debating will change that. Some things just are. We will never come to agreement. Accept it. Now tell me again why appealing Roe v Wade is the right thing to do? Of course he's dead now, so we'll never know. âœ“",

He did a lot of shooting from the hip. Choosing Sarah Palin was a great example. A brainstorming session, do something bold, and oops a tragic mistake. He did it again when he suspended his campaign because of the financial crisis, called a big meeting in DC to brainstorm ideas. He had no ideas, couldn't even lead the meeting. Obama did. He would have been a terrible president. We might have done a few bold and disastrous things, and I'm sure the important stuff would have fallen through the cracks. We were right not to elect him president in 2008.",
