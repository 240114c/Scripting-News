It happened because Netscape seeded the market with a few <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/10/27/salonherringwiredfoolcom.html\">popular feeds</a>.

Then software developed that made it easy to use the feeds, and finally the mother of all news pubs, the NYT, jumped in and everyone else followed. With the benefit of hindsight, the mail list people thought was so important, wasn't. ",
