I don't have time to write about it now, but it sounds like what I experienced in the Frontier community leading up to my leaving in 2002. I will say this, that you can't forget that it's software you'd developing, and not the community. That's where the focus has to be. Otherwise you explode. No one person can be the focal point of a development community, and if it's a blogging community it's 100000 times worse! :boom:",
