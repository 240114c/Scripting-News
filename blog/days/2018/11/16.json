            "text": "<a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/likes\">Likes</a> is a Node-based server that manages an SQL database of triplets: username, URL of the thing they liked, and a timestamp. When you like something, it adds a record to the database. When you unlike, the record is removed. There's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/client/\">demo app</a> that shows how to hook up to the server in your own web apps. I've factored the code so there's an <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/browser/api\">API</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/browser\">UI</a>. You probably will only use the API in your stuff. We use Twitter for identity. If you want to run your own server, which is fine with me, you will need to create an app on <a href=\"https://apps.twitter.com/\">Twitter</a>. Questions are <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/likes/issues/1\">welcome</a>. ",

But to me journalism is often, in some ways, a monolith. Yes I know some writers are better than others. And I know all tech isn't the same (his counter-example), but I also understand that as a user, I see tech companies acting in concert. I see limits they impose to give themselves power that I can't have. Same in journalism. So it's totally valid to write about journalism as an entity, because in some ways, for me, that's how I experience it. As with all writing, I only write about my experience.",
