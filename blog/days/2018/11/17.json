It's a way to tell me that you saw what I wrote and found it likeable. It doesn't mean you necessarily agree. You're also registering your presence to other people who read this blog. Maybe it's more like a ping? Hmmm. I know the Like icon doesn't show up in your feed reader (maybe that can change) but it may be worth a trip to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">my blog</a> if you want to say hi to me and others who read this blog. That's what it means. ",
