It's inverted from a spam point of view. You comment in your Twitter flow. I get to read your comment because I follow the <a href=\"http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/comments/rss.xml\">RSS feed</a> and the #scriptingnews tag. If I think what you said is valuable I can <i>like</i> it, or RT it or follow you. So there's a way for me to amplify your flow, but it's my choice. 2. Twitter's new 280-char limit works really well, as <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html\">noted</a> earlier. It's enough to express an idea, but not enough to write a blog post. Perfect. ",
