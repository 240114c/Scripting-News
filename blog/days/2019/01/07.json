Since then it's gotten worse, as Jay explains in this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1082105442820595713\">Twitter thread</a>. Today it needs more than a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/03/19/theRebootOfJournalism.html\">reboot</a>. More like a tear-down and rebuild. Back in the podcast days I wasn't a believer in what they call \"citizen journalism.\" Now I think it's the only thing that can save us. ",

As I understand it, we already have walls where ever it is practical. It's not possible to put a wall on a river, and much of the border between the US and Mexico is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande\">Rio Grande</a>. You can't put a wall on the bank of a river. That's ridiculous. So I think before we have discussions about this thing that is supposedly possible, let's first address the question of whether it is.

Hopefully many young people will look to her as a role model, and will value intelligence, courage, education and their ability to make a difference. Now, we need journalism of that quality, because without it, politics can never really get out of the sewer. ",
