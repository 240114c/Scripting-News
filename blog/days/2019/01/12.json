In <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/\">June</a> I was in Rome, and also was waiting in <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/dscn7807jpg\">line</a> with the <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/dscn7800jpg\">Scobles</a> for the very first <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/afterTappingTheScreen\">iPhone</a>.
