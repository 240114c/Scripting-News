I believe they should have competed, created a <i>news Facebook</i> of their own, any one of them could, and until they offer the level playing field that tech offers, they can't get our help. There's actually a lot to this. I scratch the surface in this 15-minute rambling (sorry) podcast. ",

If you have this sushi in front of you waiting to be eaten, you are the richest you can possibly be. It does not matter how much money you have in the bank. Or how long you will live. Or who likes you. You are about to eat the best meal possible. You can't be richer than that. BTW, the sushi is from <a href=\"https://sushiran.com/\">Sushi Ran</a> in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sushiran/@37.8583434,-122.4848849,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xeaae7b88a5c5d2ad!8m2!3d37.8586378!4d-122.485828\">Sausalito</a>.",
