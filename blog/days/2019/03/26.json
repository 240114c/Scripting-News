My <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/26/eveAndPeterWalkingToSchoolIn1964.png\">mother and little brother</a> were on the front page of the NYT on Sept 14, 1964, walking from our mostly white <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens\">neighborhood</a>, to the paired school in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens\">Corona</a>, a black neighborhood. (She was wearing a scarf and looking into the camera.) The white parents and kids walked toward the black neighborhood, the black parents and kids, walked to the school in the white neighborhood. My brother, now 60, posted <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/school-segregation-new-york.html?comments#permid=31244308\">a comment</a> on the NYT story.",
