            "text": "The only question at the Austin conference wasn't really a question. In the back row a woman said I was talking about privilege when I was telling the story of the very earliest days of blogging. I said there were no barriers to entry. I guess she imagined the barriers were there, and I would have seen them and felt them if I weren't a privileged white male. She wasn't so nice about the way she said that, btw. And I didn't figure that out in the moment. The truth is, as I said, there were no barriers. So they couldn't have stopped anyone if they were another race or gender, they just weren't there. If a 40-something black woman from the east coast tried to start blogging, I think it would have worked, and instead of coming out of Silicon Valley, blogging might have come out of some other community, and have evolved in a different way. No matter what they would have had to know a little scripting, and be curious about how the protocols of the Internet worked. Maybe my privilege made it more likely I'd be interested. But I think it was more hereditary, and as I said at the conference, the impulse to blog was something I inherited from my mother, not a white man. Anyway, at first, I promise you, it was more a question of courage and imagination than any deep skills. That came later when we tried to create end-user software for blogging. For that you'd have to know a lot of programming techniques. I for one would have been anxious to work with whoever was the first blogger. <i>Working together</i> is what I'm all about. ",

That hasn't happened in a long time. Partially I think it's because I'm relaxed? Maybe I don't give as much of a shit? Or who knows. But it's a fact, I got nothing done today. I guess it happens. I'm going to spend the rest of the day doing the following: 1. Watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)\">Big Little Lies</a> season 1.  2. Catching up on the latest in The Mueller Report. 3. Watching a bit of NBA Playoff action. 4. Are the Mets playing? ",
