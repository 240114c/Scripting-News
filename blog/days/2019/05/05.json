Not cheap. But I've used it almost every day since then. Listening to the radio in the morning is part of my daily ritual. I love that I've had it so long. But of course there is a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075313J1R/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1\">new model</a> that has all the features I want. The best one is simply that it supports Bluetooth and that means anything I can play on my iPhone that's always in my pocket I can play on the kitchen radio. It means however that I'll have to replace the radio I love so much. Oh well. ",
