I bet my brother and I, when we saw <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/martindale-chief-diner-craryville\">the diner</a>, begged our parents to stop. It was the middle of the night (or so it felt to me, then) and they must've been tired. Kids are a pain in the ass. Anyway, I was driving on 23 today and passed the diner, remembered it from childhood, so I stopped and took a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/chiefDiner1.jpg\">couple</a> of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/chiefDiner2.jpg\">pictures</a>.

For example, in T&B there are people and animals, as in Bojack, but <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/plantAsACharacter.png\">plants</a> also have intelligence and speak and have legs and can walk and go places (and are teenagers). Also they include little bits of non-animated <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/humanInTuca.png\">human stuff</a> in it. And the snarky Easter eggs are even better. But it's also got a bit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli\">Studio Ghibli</a> in it and trippy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away\">Spirted Away</a> type stuff. I love the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/05/tiffany-haddish-ali-wong-tuca-and-bertie-interview-tribeca-1202605920/\">actors</a>. I'm only on Episode 4 and savoring every moment.",
