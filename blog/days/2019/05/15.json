Briefly it's the part of Twitter that knows you're @howardweaver and I'm @davewiner. I need that in my software too. Rather than build my own, and make users establish a new \"identity\" for my apps, e.g. -- \"little outliner\",  I just use Twitter's. That's the open part.",

A very simple dish, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/15/dinner.png\">broccoli, carrots</a> -- cooked lightly, then lightly covered in olive oil, soy sauce and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha_sauce\">Sriracha</a>, over rice. Just perfect. Previous iterations were basically edible. Working my way up to a full dinner for guests, maybe by Thanksgiving. But for now I'm happy to be eating well. Living in NYC made it too easy to order delicious food that was too greasy and too much and made me unhappy. ",
