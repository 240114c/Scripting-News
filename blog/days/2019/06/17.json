He heard a famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Beck\">TV conservative</a> talk about the America of his youth, how great everything was, how simple, fun, safe. The conservative was born in the mid-60s. When he talks about his youth, he's talking about the 70s. Nixon, Kent State, Watergate, Vietnam, spiraling stagflation, the hostage crisis, OPEC, it goes on and on. It's conceivable that the pundit doesn't know that the world was totally crazy when he was growing up. Lehane concludes, wisely, what conservatives want is to be children again. ",

Of course it doesn't work that way.",
