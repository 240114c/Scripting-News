But the <a href=\"https://torontolife.com/culture/movies-and-tv/how-designated-survivor-built-a-replica-oval-office-in-toronto/\">set</a> for the Oval Office is much better. After looking through HBO, I landed on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affair_(TV_series)\">The Affair</a> on Showtime. Finally something with an adult plot, and HBO style. One of the stars is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_West\">McNulty</a> from The WIre and his asshole <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doman\">father-in-law</a> is the police chief who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rawls\">tormented</a> McNulty. And the sex is not gratuitous, it's the plot. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk,_New_York\">Montauk</a> is very photogenic as is McNulty's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Wilson\">lover</a>. It got <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-affair\">high ratings</a>, I'm in episode 3 of season one and there are four seasons, so I'm hopeful. ",
