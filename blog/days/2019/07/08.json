Jury duty is a powerful idea, and it works. It's the basis for our justice system. I've written about jury duty many times, in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/02/08/whyShouldYouJoinAJury.html\">2017</a>, <a href=\"http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/whatILearnedFromJuryDuty\">2013</a>, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/29/juryDutyDay2.html\">2008</a>, and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/03/01/juryduty.html\">1996</a>. (The last piece is probably the best, I did it for Wired as well as my blog.)",

If you're going to use a CDN that doesn't let you overlay your own domain name, and your code is coming from an S3 bucket, it's much easier to use <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com\">s3.amazonaws.com</a> and no less independent of another entity. I imagine this is okay with Amazon because it's lock-in. But this is a <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/code/nbariver/index.html\">river</a> that works over HTTPS, the URL Is uglier than shit, but it works. It's an important milestone because my users have legit reasons to want to make rivers accessible via HTTPS.",

Flow == more followers == power and prestige. I wonder if there's a way to reward people based on the depth and originality of ideas they post, or RT. Zero points for repeating a talking point from a random hack on Meet The Press. Huge points for an idea that makes people want to consume less. ",
