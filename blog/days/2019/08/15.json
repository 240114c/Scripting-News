You can see that in Scott's comment about the Dodgers (he's a diehard Giants fan). I would forgive him for hating the Dodgers, because it's basically self-mockery. And I hate do the Yankees. But when you break it down, what is it exactly that I hate? The Bronx? Certainly not. The stadium? Well it is an inferior stadium, no one can argue otherwise. But hate? I'm a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html\">barking farting chihuahua</a>, looking for a little love and understanding in my short life on planet Earth. My hate wouldn't mean very much. But when it comes to baseball and the Yankees, it's mine. It mighâ€  be all I have, so I try to hold on to it. #lgm",
