They had academics theorizing, but none said the obvious reason why all Russian-inspired autocrats do anything -- to squeeze every dollar of value that's available to them by selling off some asset of the country. Usually at small fractions of a penny on the dollar. They don't care. Everything the country owns is ripe to plunder. Bolsonaro (and Trump et al) has enough bullshit to throw at journalists to keep them debating every reason but the real one, which for some reason no one seems to be able to say. They're looting their country. Same reason the Repubs in the US want to kill Social Security and Medicare. They want the money for themselves. .",
