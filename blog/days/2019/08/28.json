My two cents. I would like to see MIT and Harvard people use their prestige to set us on a better course as a society. Most people there are too risk-averse, trying to protect their careers. What a waste. We don't live long enough for that to be a proper motivation imho. That said I'm not so cynical. I have been able to get stuff done personally at Harvard, it's actually a pretty good place to shake things up, if you don't care about getting your position renewed (which I guess I didn't). ",

Since it's my second time through this area, I did it better than last time. It's just a matter of writing docs, testing, and getting other people interested/excited, and most important updating the <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/\">XML-RPC website</a>, which hasn't been touched in many years. Might be just the project for my newly powerful <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/08/28.html\">blog</a>. ",

We will find out if that works at midnight tonight. I can't test it by sending emails to everyone. The changes weren't very great, just a URL and the format of a JSON file. I'm optimistic that it will work, but since it's software, I'm praying :pray: too. If you're reading this in an email, it worked. ",
