Saying something is tone-deaf means you don't agree. Why can't you just say it that way? Why do you have to insult the person? To me it says you're not really confident in your own beliefs. In speech the only thing that's really tone-deaf is saying some else is tone-deaf.",

I've collaborated with both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)\">Scott</a> and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html\">Chris</a>, on successful projects, decades apart. They know what can be accomplished with very little money. The money can buy you the illusion of creativity, the actual creativity is invisible to the eye, but is reflected in the product of the work. There's an inverse relationship often between appearances and what comes out the other end of the innovation assembly line. ",

I saved the whole of season 2 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)\">Big Little Lies</a> to watch in a binge. It was good. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdZTGj3xag0\">Meryl Streep</a>, omg. I won't spoil it, but she plays a character from my neighborhood growing up. Something bad happened in her life, and we'll never know what role she played in it. The story is just as gripping as the previous season, and the acting superb. In other binges, I've started to work on season 2 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)\">Succession</a>, just watched the first episode. I'm going to savor this show. One of the characters reminds me of Jason Calacanis for some reason. Just as the main character of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despicable_Me\">Despicable Me</a>, Gru, reminds me of Mike Arrington, even though he looks nothing like him. But I digress. I still have to do something about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black\">Orange is the New Black</a>. I stopped watching toward the beginning of Season 5. I have no idea how to get back up to speed. Same with the third season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)\">The Handmaid's Tale</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)\">Counterpart</a> -- both of which were very entertaining, but complex. Getting back up to speed in multi-season shows is hard. It might be a good idea to have a digest, maybe in written form, to help you get rebooted in these shows.",
