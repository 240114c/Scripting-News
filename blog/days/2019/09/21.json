In the story, a teacher urges a student to be the sky (paraphrasing), observe your feelings the way the sky might observe the flow of a river. This is something I've learned, it comes with age and experience, self-knowledge. I think  you can learn it at a young age, if you're taught and you practice. Once you can observe your feelings, fully feel them, but not let them become you, that's when you come into your power. Some reviewers say the series is about mental illness, but that's only one theory of the show, and not the one we're left with, waiting for season 2. I'm probably going to watch it again, it's such rich story and so beautifully told. ",

He was hired as a product marketing manager at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext\">Living Videotext</a> in the mid-80s, but he was so much more. We went to dinner probably two or three nights a week, and mostly about where to go with our outliner products, and what the competition in the Valley was doing. I would try ideas out on Scott, give him limited background, to see where his mind would go. Very creative and hard-working mind. Scott reads this blog via the nightly email.

They illustrate more generally that political parties play dirty when they realize they can't stay in power any other way. But -- consider this sentence -- \"The only way out of this situation is for the Republican Party to become more diverse.\" As a programmer, which teaches me to challenge my assumptions, it's a critical part of design and debugging, I see that it's <i>not</i> the only way out. Political parties aren't like baseball teams. As long as there's baseball, your favorite team will continue, though they could move or change their name. For example, the Washington Nationals are the former <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals#Montreal_Expos\">Montreal Expos</a>. But the same must not be true of political parties. The Repubs had a good run, but they went down a path that didn't work. So they lose elections. What of it. There's no way the Democrats will rule the whole country unopposed for any amount of time -- a new party will form. In all likelihood two new parties will form. There aren't enough white Christians in the US to rule, and many of them, esp the young ones, see themselves as part of a diverse America. Eventually the Repubs will disappear, the question is how much damage will they do on their way out.",
