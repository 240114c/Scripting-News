Pelosi can handle everything but impeachment. Refer all questions to the prosecutor.)",

We're in a bad place. Trump's corruption is \"priced-in\" so you can say Trump did something even more horrible than ever before and people go yeah, that's nice, but what are we going to do about it. If the past is any indication, nothing. And Trump can dirty-up Biden's name and create a nice false equivalence for the journos to relax into. We're all comfortable in doing what we do. We had a series of marches in 2017, and then settled back into complacency and complicity in the rise of authoritarianism in the US. If we want to stop it, protest won't do it. Resistance won't, or civil disobedience. We need a revolution now, and luckily our founders thought it might come to that, after all they had just fought one. In the Constitution are the tools to overturn the government, immediately. But we also need a revolution in journalism, an awakening, creating authority in expertise.
