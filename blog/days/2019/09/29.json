Which I am doing right now. Sounds lovely. The songs are all so great, and form the musical sound track of my whole life all the way back to <a href=\"https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/queens/2125-Ps-32-State-Street/\">elementary school</a>! As I said yesterday, and it bears repeating, that all the Beatles albums are deeply ingrained in who I am. All my early life experiences connected with every other period of my life. I started listening to the Beatles early in life and never stopped. But I only hear the Beatles, I only hear Abbey Road on the new mixes. It doesn't sound any different from other mixes. I wish it did, because I'd love to have more Beatles revelations at my age, which also has significance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCTunqv1Xt4\">in Beatles terms</a>. Heh. But it sounds the same as it always did, full of wonder, like Abbey Road, like the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=beatles+site%3Ascripting.com\">music of my life</a>. ",

They didn't bother with the play by play unless <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/09/29/mets-pete-alonso-completely-enjoyed-history-making-moment/\">Pete Alonso</a> was up. At other times they interviewed Mets and Braves players from the dugout. They talked about how nice everyone is, at length. How Alonso must feel now, after hitting the home run, in great detail without any input from Pete, who was on the field at first base, crying. I wondered who likes this style of baseball. I saw him hit the 53rd home run, I was happy for him. But the actual news is that the Mets season is over. And the <i>bad news</i> is that these idiots will be doing the broadcasts for much of the postseason baseball which starts next week. I know this isn't what's wrong with America, but it's a symptom of what's wrong. You're there to call the game, so STFU and do your job.",
