Next question.\" Someone says go ahead impeach Trump, we'll have Pence, he's even worse, this is what you say. \"He couldn't win re-election as governor of Indiana, what makes you think he'd do so well in the 2020 election, assuming the Repubs even nominate him.\" ",

She tells a fantastic story, starting with the very first paragraph. \"My mother would be surprised that I did not die alone.\" Her story resonates with me. Families have all kinds of awful reasons for kicking members out. In her case it was that she didn't follow the family religion.

We got a taste last night of how well the kids learned from their father, and how they can work together when they are offended in the same way. I suspect they will all, together, be the successor that the show is titled for. But that's not a spoiler, because like you, I have no idea who the winner will be. Now fuck off. :boom:",
