For example, David Boroditsky checked in yesterday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boroditsky/status/1179081346943078400\">on Twitter</a>. He sent a link to an email he sent me, which I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/frontier/stories/DavidBoroditsky.html\">posted</a> to the blog, in Oct 1996, two years after the start. He talks about the non-web features of \"Frontier\". Sometimes I forget that Frontier and the blog were two sides of the same coin in the early days. All the early blogging and RSS software ran in Frontier. ",
