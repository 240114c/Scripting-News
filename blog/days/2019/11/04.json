All through October, as Clinton gained confidence, the two branches of the graph diverged, until <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comey#/media/File:Comey_Letter.jpg\">FBI Director Comey's letter</a> to Congress. I watched it live and my heart sank. Here we go again. <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Hillary%27s+Emails+site%3Ascripting.com&t=h_&ia=web\">Hillary's Emails</a>. That evening, Clinton gave a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?417629-2/hillary-clinton-calls-release-information-email-investigation\">speech</a>. Eleven days before the election. Voting is already underway. We understood the damage. And you can see it clearly in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/04/fiveThirtyEightGraph.png\">the graph</a> on this day in 2016. Yes, Clinton was still twice as likely to win as Trump. But the graph was going the wrong way. And we know how it turned out. So remember, the story that the NY Times invented, promoted with love by the FBI and the rest of journalism, was probably a bigger cause of America's defeat than Cambridge Analyitica and Facebook. But of course the NYT controls the conversation, and is unaccountable, so the blame is focused elsewhere. ",

Yet I don't think many of those libraries include support for this two-year-old format. So you have to do more work to read it. One of the goals of the new format was that it would be less work. ",

I had designed a format when RSS came along, from Netscape, and I dropped it in favor of RSS, because one way to do something is better than two no matter how much better the second way is. A hard-won lesson from many times around the loop. Hopefully this is something will not be repeated for RSS at least, in the future. ",
