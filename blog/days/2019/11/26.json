It's like the line in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Harry_Met_Sally...\">Harry Met Sally</a> where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55VPeDVxsrg\">Carrie Fisher</a> says \"He'll never leave her, I know, I know he'll never leave her.\" Everyone says it at some point. We can recite it along with them. \"No one thinks he'll ever leave her,\" says Meg Ryan. At some point you hope she gets the clue. Everyone but the reporters knows why Trump loves Russia. At some point it would be useful if the reporters would just use it in their reporting. ",
