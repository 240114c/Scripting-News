Might try again. Instead, I watched a few episodes of the first season of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Larry_Sanders_Show\">Larry Sanders Show</a> on HBO. I had heard it mentioned on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/11/778304093/judd-apatow-on-his-mentor-comic-garry-shandling\">Fresh Air</a> a couple of weeks ago, and it was totally worth it. How great is a comedy show that actually both holds your interest and gets you to laugh out loud.

Few series are so great that they check all the boxes, but some do. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire\">The Wire</a> was the best of all time. Mad Men had a very strong vision, but the quality of story-telling was spotty, as was Breaking Bad. Deadwood, what a great show, but it ended before it got to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota#19th_century\">punchline</a>. I like intense political drama and crime stories that get you into the characters. So I'm considering re-watching a few <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/list/ls049563664/\">HBO miniseries</a> that got to me the first time: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Kitteridge_(miniseries)\">Olive Kitteridge</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Of\">The Night Of</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(miniseries)\">Mildred Pierce</a>.
