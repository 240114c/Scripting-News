None of us should just shrug it off and say the impeachment vote will be partisan as usual. They shouldn't get off that easy. They must know that we know that they're voting for the end of the Constitution. We should all write this as fact. Make the record clear.",

Amazon <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html?emc=rss&partner=rss\">appropriated</a> the small company's trademark -- Elastic? Please, NYT call at least one developer before you run a story like this, or do a <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=amazon+elastic&t=h_&ia=web\">search</a>. This is super embarrassing -- for you. Here's the problem with the premise. Amazon has been calling their services Elastic this and that since inception. The first was <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">EC2</a>. Elastic Compute Cloud. It was <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2006/08/24.html#When:8:07:26AM\">started in 2006</a>, six years before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_NV\">startup</a> was founded. It seems to me, unless I'm missing something, that the startup copied Amazon.",
