If they're successful, judges are just people, their opinions don't matter. Why do they care so much about judges then. Also, suppose the Supreme Court says his tax returns must be released.

A product everyone uses won't add a feature that would open it up to new ideas by independent devs. So you have to reimplement the whole thing, and convert their user base, to try out a new idea. Which means the new idea never gets tried out. First experience was MS-DOS and its lack of a clipboard in 1985. The OS had to be scrapped, effectively, because it never adapted to the more-than-one-app-at-a-time model, even though developers were achieving great success with that model.",

In the last week, we finished the first round, and now there are new matchups, and public opinion matters in a whole new way. And guess what, on CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC -- they keep saying the same tired and wrong things they were saying last week and the week before. It's just a horse race to them. Nothing matters but the election in November 2020. ",
