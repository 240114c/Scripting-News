I guess this is inline with the way they vet apps for iPhones. Can't let any random ideas get to iPhone users. Best to be safe. Perhaps to keep China happy? Not kidding. Tech companies ultimately have to yield to authoritarian countries, where they keep strict control on what the people can read. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50902496\">Russia</a> can now disconnect their country's net off the world wide net. Losing a news platform like this is dangerous to freedom, pretty much everywhere. Best not to trust them with our flow of information, so use another news platform on their phones, and use other non-Apple podcatchers.",

But since then Facebook and Twitter have matched or bettered Radio in flow. There's a new benchmark. WordPress appears oblivious. So no I don't think Gutenberg, which is a new text editor for WordPress, is the answer. It is the answer to other problems, how to mix text and other elements in a blog post.

For that you should probably start with an outliner, study it, learn from it and adapt it to public writing. That's where imho the real juice is. ",
