I'm not happy about that, but it is what it is. Saying online is dangerous is like saying the subway is dangerous. But if you live in New York, you probably want to take the subway. Driving is dangerous. Everything is. Life itself isn't safe. It's a mix. You have to learn to discern. But most people are good, and most people are on Facebook. And it pisses me off that a few of my neighbors won't use Facebook, and when I ask why, they repeat the talking points of the journalists, almost verbatim. We perceive the world of today as being more dangerous than the world we grew up in. In fact, today's world is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/14/theres-never-been-a-safer-time-to-be-a-kid-in-america/?noredirect=on\">much safer</a>. Perceptions that come from listening to journalism too much. It seems, knowing this, it would be responsible to temper their promotion of fear. It creates an obstacle we have to overcome. But they keep at it. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/social-media-2020.html\">Stay away little person</a>. Online is dangerous. Better to stay safe. ",

Funny how that works. I said this: \"Honestly I never thought I’d make it to 2020.\" Now it's 100 percent my fault there was confusion. Going back to the 1960s, when we had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_cover\">duck and cover drills</a> in school, we all thought for sure we'd die in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust\">nuclear holocaust</a> long before 2020. If you had asked me then what were the chances I'd be alive in 2020, I probably would have said \"No one will be alive in 2020.\" But here we are. :boom:",

He should have been teamed up with LeBron or someone like him. He'd make a great #2. But he was miscast as the hero of the Knicks, so the Melo Knicks were losers. But because he's so sweet and he has a great shot, New York loves Melo. ",
