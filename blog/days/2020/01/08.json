For me, a re-hash of what's in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/01/03/214302.html?title=whenWeTalkAboutFacebook\">piece</a> I wrote on January 3, about the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1214966166512427010\">scale</a> of Facebook, and how the theory you hear most in journalismm that ignores the billion or so people who use Facebook and focuses on how they feel about the company. I've yet to see an act of journalism that didn't flaunt their conflict of interest. In the thread, Facebook has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1214979702810697731\">compared</a> to a supermarket, NBC and Times Square. It is none of those things, it's much much bigger. It's a community of a billion or more users, and is as diverse as those people are. Most people in my experience have good intentions, and that's true on Facebook. Even the ones who aren't nice, are probably just struggling with something. I'd like to see a few journalists adopt the point of view that Facebook is not a simple place, can't be reduced to  good or evil, isn't a product of one or two peoples' personalities, that it's made up of an incomprehensibly huge group of people, from everywhere.
