Turns out Overcast doesn't like titleless posts. I don't use Overcast myself, so I can't offer specific advice, but it is not acceptable to use the file name as a title. That's not what the file name is for. I described the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216404689719365634\">use-case</a> in a tweet (of course without a title, tweets don't have titles). Vendors tend to ignore advice on these issues, and that's kept us from growing. I used to budge for them on this issue, but <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html\">decided in 2017</a> to stop. All the compromises meant that my blog disappears. Bottom-line: I put podcasts on title-less posts. <i>That's never going to change. </i>",
