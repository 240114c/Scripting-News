This is an interesting medium because unlike other podcasts I've listened to Doc on, in this mode he gets to talk as long as he wants and can pause, and say whatever you want. Anyway I've decided I'm going to build a basketball court so when you visit we can meditate over shooting hoops. Anyway. Focus is the thing. Creating a groove. And making each other more powerful. That's going to be my next chapter. I do want to hear about your experience with Medium. We all have our own stories. I also want to tell you a story about Dave Bunnell. And why walking is the best.",

Doing real things to make America work better in every way, especially politically. I wrote this idea up in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/21/theWhiteHouseWebsite.html\">2009</a> as Obama took office and didn't follow through on the promise (imho) of his campaign. Sanders is a nice guy for sure, but he can't do the organizing we need to do (see <a href=\"#a180053\">above</a>). It's not something you can delegate. I think Bloomberg may get this, but I'm not sure. The politicians running for office are still very old school, and Sanders is the oldest of them.",

By now they should know Trump-speak. When he says he \"thinks\" something that means he made it up. What's the point in wasting so much time on it, when everyone with a mind understands exactly what he was saying. ",

I look for others doing their own things, so we can perform together. Our ideas influence, are tested and improved on.
