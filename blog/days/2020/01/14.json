My friends, they're both perfectly awful choices for president. Bernie is still living in the 60s. He has no ideas about the world as it exists today. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217116064158560256\">Ask him</a>. Second, Warren is a Harvard professor. She's not of the people. She's more comfortable in the faculty lunchroom, making snide jokes about the little people. They're both incredibly terrible choices to run the country starting in 2021. Neither will get done what they say they will, that will require team-building skills which neither have, and compromise, which means you have to listen. Even Obama, a relatively young person, was totally unprepared to deal with foreign hacking of our election. There's a reason Bernie doesn't have any apps on his phone. I bet he doesn't know what an app is or what the capabilities of mobile devices are. If he did, I think he'd be screaming about it in the special way Bernie screams. :rocket:",

Who would see the problems we have now as interesting challenges. Would know who wants what in exchange for the things we need to do. Someone with a rolodex of effective people. Neither Warren or Sanders have the ability to do any of that. Elect them and at best you get a Jimmy Carter. I don't mean weak, the way the Repubs do, I mean having no idea how to get things done in Washington, and therefore proceeding to get nothing done.",

There are experts all over the place, who can provide fresh perspectives on the news, to engage people's minds, and set examples for creative approaches. I lamented that even though there is a former outstanding blogger running <a href=\"https://shorensteincenter.org/\">Shorenstein</a>, one of the leading university think tanks for journalism, the walls remain, and we're no closer to fulfilling the opportunities created in the early web. <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nicco-mele\">Nicco Mele</a>, the blogger I was referring to, is no longer in charge of Shorenstein. I was so-advised by two former colleagues. I'm <i>really</i> out of the loop, that's for sure. Anyway, the new director is <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nancy-gibbs?_ga=2.187920296.1420702108.1579015693-1352129629.1577806700\">Nancy Gibbs</a>.
