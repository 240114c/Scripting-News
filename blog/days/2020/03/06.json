Touching all kinds of surfaces that probably are infected. The place had a Thanksgiving-like feel to it. Could just be a Friday thing in late winter. I've been stocking up on canned goods. I buy about twice as much as I need every week. Also noted there is <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/06/plentyOfToiletPaperInHannafords.png\">plenty of toilet paper</a> on the shelves. Apparently people here aren't so scared of running out. The only thing that was in short supply was <a href=\"https://www.breadalone.com/home\">Bread Alone</a> bread, for some reason. I should've asked. It looks like they're not going to carry it in the future? That would be not good. ",

What's the best way to get a text file from my Mac onto my iPhone. Best == least work. Lots of answers. The thing I like about email the best is that the same approach works from a browser-based app like \"LO2\". I can add email capabilities there so I can make a list in the outliner and email it to my phone. That will be beautiful.",

It wasn't to keep the employee from talking, it was to keep the company silent, because <i>we</i> were the ones who were harmed. After the suit was over and settled, I realized then why none of his references were willing to talk about him. He was going through the Valley, to companies who were hungry for skilled programmers, and willing to take a chance, with or without references. No doubt we weren't the last company to pay him off and accept an NDA. ",
