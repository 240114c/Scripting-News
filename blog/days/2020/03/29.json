In the end I went another way, adding a long-wanted plug-in capability to <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/pagePark\">PagePark</a>, my labor-of-love Node-based web server. I found a really Nodey way to do it, much better imho than using <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp\">eval</a> or <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_vm.asp\">vm</a>. I <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_modules.asp\">use</a> <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html\">modules</a>. A lot of people don't know they can be in files, not just distributed through NPM. It's a really nice way to do plug-ins, and it's made something cool possible with Little Outliner. More on that later. In the meantime I've written up the use of modules as PagePark plug-ins in the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/158#issuecomment-605650163\">thread</a> about regex.<i> Still diggin!</i>",
