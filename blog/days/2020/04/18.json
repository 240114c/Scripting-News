I didn't like the picture that was there <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/26/lake.png\">before</a>, but spring hasn't happened here yet, and until then I have nothing to replace it with. Thelma and Louise should be the default header here, as it is the permanent one on my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner\">Twitter feed</a>. BTW, I've been meaning to say this, if you want to get the most out of this <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">blog</a> you should have an account on Twitter so you can, for example, go there and vote in the polls. Twitter has a useful set of functionality, and they let me use their API and identity system for $0. Pretty good deal. You don't have to do it of course. :rocket: ",

Stop duplicating efforts, chasing gotchas, going through the loops with Trump, and making users give each of you their information just to give you money. Reduce friction, build a new journalism we can all be proud of. ",
