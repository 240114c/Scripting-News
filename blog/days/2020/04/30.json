And I was sure all the meat would have gone, given the problems with meat processing plants, but not so. The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/checkoutLine.png\">checkout line</a> was ridiculously long, but moved quickly. All in all a gratifying experience.

Note the items in the feed have <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/feedHasGuidsAsYouCanSee.png\">proper guid elements</a>, so there should be no need to use the title as a guid, but it seems that Apple's podcast app does, because when I changed the titles of the five most recent episodes, voila -- they show up in the Apple podcasts app. This was suggested on Twitter by <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/og/\">OG</a> podcaster <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bloatedlesbian/status/1255697398485180418\">Madge Weinstein</a>.
