It appears this was an error, or Apple changed their mind. Also, I love the word <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=kerfuffle\">kerfuffle</a>. Surprisingly, it's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kerfuffle\">not the first time</a> I've used it, according to Google. I'm surprised. But it appears to be the first time <i>in 13 years. </i>",

Maybe it's because I'm a former entrepreneur that I see <i>tons</i> of ways to do this.   Biden, for example, could give Fauci a pulpit. I've tried this idea out of people inside the Democratic Party, they say this just isn't done. And that's a reason not to do something? Bill Gates could do it. He's entrepreneurial. It doesn't have to be Fauci himself, any affable avuncular scientist who tells the truth. As Trump fades into oblivion we should fill the airwaves with facts. That's a good way to \"save my life\". ðŸ˜‡",
