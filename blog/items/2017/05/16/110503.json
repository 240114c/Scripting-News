    "text": "This morning I posted on Scripting News the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/16/experimentingWithAPersonalTwitter.html\">story</a> of the new Slack group, and created a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczq-JCEHdjxTzE916RImGgv7Zg_vwtsEpmi-IJzapYS2KxGg/viewform?c=0&w=1\">Google Form</a> that allows people to request an invite. This, I hope, is the first step of a bootstrap, on both the reading and the editorial side. I don't know if one blogger (me) will be able to hold the interest of the group, and I'm pretty sure Slack is not the right environment (it's configured for workgroups, not news). But this is an easy first step, and that's how you learn what the second step is, and on from there. ",
