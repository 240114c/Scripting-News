    "text": "Today's Daily <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/15389.html\">podcast</a> has a pretty good summary of what happened with Comey and Trump. One thing Comey did right is keep Trump's requests away from the FBI agents doing the investigation. He didn't want Trump to influence them, and he didn't want them picking up any signals from him either. You can say you have nothing to say, but actually saying nothing is far more powerful. ",
