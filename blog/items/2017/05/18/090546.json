Oh yeah. I know all about it. And corporations. The press is totally complicit. Their idea of credibility is how much money you have. So you become a billionaire and now, the story goes, you're smarter than everyone else. What if a person, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html\">wisely</a>, doesn't organize their creativity solely for the purpose of becoming obscenely rich? Is there any way to win? It would be great if journalism, becoming aware of this, works to change the culture. Look for good ideas that come from non-super-rich.",
