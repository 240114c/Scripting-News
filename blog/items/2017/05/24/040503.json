    "text": "This has been a week of goal-setting. One of my goals is to make the news distribution system more effective, and lessen the reliance on silos. To do so, I am committed to relaying links to important and interesting news when I am working at my desktop, and often when I have my iPad with me. With just a few more people doing the same we could have a richer more diverse news flow, without added cost, without the price extracted by the silos. ",
