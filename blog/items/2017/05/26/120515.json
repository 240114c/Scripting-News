    "text": "I just added simple Markdown support to *Old School*. If you set the type of a node to markdown, when it's rendered, either on a page, or in a feed, the text is passed through a Markdown renderer. I'm using [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked). It's got a very nice ability to override renderer options. I was able to catch the rendering for a paragraph and not return the HTML markup for paragraphs because in this context it's redundant.",
