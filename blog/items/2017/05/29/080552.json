In the new scheme, there will be posts that don't have titles. They're like tweets. Some of them <i>are</i> tweets. Not this one because it has more than 140 chars. Anyway, there will be items without titles. If you have questions, please post an <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues\">issue</a> on the Scripting News repo on GitHub. ",
