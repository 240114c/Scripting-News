But these days I probably get as much value from the NYT as I would from the Washington Post. There are a couple of other pubs I'd subscribe to if the price were more reasonable, considering I only exceed their quota of free stories by about the middle of the month. The New Yorker is one for sure. And there are free-to-read pubs that deserve some of the money too, like <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog\">TPM</a> and <a href=\"http://nymag.com/author/Jonathan%20Chait/\">New York Mag</a>. It's not fair that I pay the NYT and not them. ",
