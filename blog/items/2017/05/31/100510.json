To kick it off I added a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/misc/pingLog.json\">log</a> of cloud pings generated by my blog, to help <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/6\">JY and Andrew</a> figure out where the bug is. I say this knowing full well that my code is indicted, it's the newest code in the mix. I really appreciate these two guys pitching in. And I'm glad to make the intro. Andrew and JY are two of the nicest most generous people I know in the programming world. ",
