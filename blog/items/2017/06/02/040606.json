No guarantees there will be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States\">correction</a>. He has power he hasn't yet figured out that he has, or only recently has figured out. Power that no honorable president would use. But maybe that's not a problem for him. ",

In the past the Repubs have played at brinksmanship, extracting concessions from the president, who was a Democrat. The assumption was the president would act responsibly. But now we have a bomb thrower in the White House. What if he was the one who blackmailed the rest of us? ",
