    "text": "When I link to search queries I'm using <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DuckDuckGo</a> now. I was using Google figuring that they'd be the most long-lived search engine -- the links would likely work years from now. But it all comes down to what \"work\" <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=work&t=h_&ia=web\">means</a>. Google is playing <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/30/strategyTax.html\">strategy tax</a> games with search. I no longer consider it authoritative. It misses too many things that are important for reasons that have nothing to do with their value as a search result. I'm bettting that DuckDuckGo has a stronger philosophy and even if they were not to last as long as Google they're still worth supporting. ",
