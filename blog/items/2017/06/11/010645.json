    "text": "I believe it's time to make my own version of the Twitter and Facebook timelines. A merger of the two, that can accomodate all my feeds, without strategy taxes. The realtime technology is now ready, it seems. I'm thinking of a personal Twitter, a fractional horsepower Facebook. It's time to stop waiting for them to listen. Listening is not one of their core competences. They haven't figured out how to scale listening. There aren't any hackathons for listening. They have yet to discover a business model for listening. You can't break things fast while listening. Got any other tech cliches to bust? ",
