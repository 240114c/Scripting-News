It gets a lot of data about the people who use it. I might have thought twice, might not even have installed it, if I had known it was a front for Facebook. Funny thing, when you go to the App Store, it <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/11/movesInAppStore.png\">doesn't tell you</a> there either. How is a user supposed to know that this innocuous app is actually a tentacle of the Internet's octopus. ",
