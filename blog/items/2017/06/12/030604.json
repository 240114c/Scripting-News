But then I realized they <i>are</i> responsible -- not to voters but to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_activities_of_the_Koch_brothers\">Kochs</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer_(businessman)#Political_activities\">Mercers</a>, and their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Adelson\">cohorts</a>.

The Kochs <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=primaried&t=hz&ia=definition\">primaried</a> every Republican with any independence. The ones left, for whatever reason, want to stay in office so badly they will do <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/republicans-know-their-health-care-plan-is-garbage.html\">anything</a> they are told they have to do to keep their jobs.
