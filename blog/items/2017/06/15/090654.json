It's not that the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/reader/blob/master/davereader.js#L769\">code</a> assumes XML, it just wasn't organized for variable syntax. It is now. So when they invent the thing that comes after JSON, it'll be somewhat easier to adjust. ",

Truth be told, their semantics will have to map on to RSS, as Atom semantics do. I don't wonder whether that exercise is worth it, it's total make-work. A lot of work with <i>no gain</i> in features, performance, interop.The kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_drill\">firedrill</a> that BigCo's make developers do. ",
