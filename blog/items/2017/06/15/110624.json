Since clicking on the top line expands the post, there was no direct link to the item. Just fixed that by <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/15/permalink.png\">adding</a> a purple link in the right margin. Feels just right. (Probably because they date back to the <a href=\"http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/permalinksNewsAggregators.html\">early</a> blogosphere.)",
