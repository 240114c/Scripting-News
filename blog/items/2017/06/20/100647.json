    "text": "Anyone want to blog-debate about XML vs JSON? I've spent years using both, I think I have an objective view of the strengths of each. Imho, they are almost the same thing. XML has attributes and values, and that does make it more complex. Slightly. But you don't have to use the extra features. Look at \"OPML\" for an idea of a simple very JSON-like application of XML. Beyond that, there's really no difference. If you disagree, write a post, link to this and send me the link. I will read what you wrote, and respond, on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">my blog</a>, if I have something to say.  There's been so much bullshit flying around. I'd like to cut through that. ",
