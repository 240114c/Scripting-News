We could go all the way, but it needs a strong operational backend, something a big company is good at, not so much individuals.

It associates storage with a user's Twitter identity. Twitter is a good service to use, unlike some others, because they have a liberal policy of who gets to <a href=\"https://apps.twitter.com/app/new\">create</a> apps. Faceook has an extensive vetting process. Twitter <a href=\"https://apps.twitter.com/app/new\">is</a> \"let a thousand flowers bloom.\" I know some people have problems with Twitter, but I've learned over many years that all corporate vendors are imperfect. If you're waiting for <a href=\"http://this.how/standards#1497798834000\">perfection</a> you'll wait forever. And you build the software so that if Twitter should again become draconian, a new service can be filled in with as little disruption as possible.",

I know there are external services that provide something \"like\" this, but fundamentally Dropbox doesn't provide enough flexibility in the API to do this in a reasonable way. (Lack of granularity in permissions, an app gets access to one folder or everything.)",
