    "text": "In 2015 I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/06/25/dropboxCouldBeKingOfTheOnepageApp.html\">wrote</a> that Dropbox could be the king of the one-page app. Because storage is the thing the web doesn't, on its own, do, and storage is the thing Dropbox does best. And they have an API, and they understood the connection to one-page-apps earlier than anyone. But it didn't happen. I've emailed with people at Dropbox from time to time and the best explanation I can come up with is that they are focused in different areas. It seems to me, from my outside perch, that they are trying to become a competitor to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/docs/about/\">Google's</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office\">Microsoft's</a> Office products. I was hoping they'd become a platform, focusing on distribution and investment in startups.",
