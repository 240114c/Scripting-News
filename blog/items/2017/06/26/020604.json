    "text": "Interesting Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/26/trump-president-style-mayor-215294\">piece</a> posits that Trump acts as if he's mayor of the United States. If <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City\">NYC</a> is his model, that mayor is esp powerless, because the governor of the state also has a lot of power over the city. It's approx 1/2 of the population of the state, and probably much more than 1/2 of the money. For example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority\">MTA</a>, which runs the buses and subway, is run by the state, not the city.",
