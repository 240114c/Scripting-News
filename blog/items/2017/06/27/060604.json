I knew this would happen with the <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&t=h_&ia=web\">Old School</a> redesign, because I am immersed in their worlds. Basically every day has the same big image. That sucks because the image has nothing to do with what's being pointed to. They designed their metadata for a model that does not fit my blogging style. For a while I changed my style to accomodate them. But as you know I don't do that anymore. Now I am myself and if they don't like it, etc.",
