    "text": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mathewi\">Mathew Ingram</a>, former old school blogger, GigaOm and then Fortune columnist, <a href=\"http://www.mathewingram.com/work/\">has a blog</a>. I'm glad. He's a good example of making money <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/06/25.html#a080624\">because you blog</a> as opposed to making money from blogging. Had he not had a blog back in Ye Olde Dayz, would he have been hired as professional columnist? It didn't hurt. :corn:",
