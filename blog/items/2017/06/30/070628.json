    "text": "A year ago today the new Knicks coach <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/knicks-coach-ny-isn-rebuilding-city-win-now-town-article-1.2694767?utm_content=buffer90dbf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=NYDNSports+Twitter\">said</a> the Knicks are a <i>win-now</i> team. So they shipped off three healthy players in a <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/knicks-trade-for-derrick-rose-send-lopez-grant-to-bulls-grades-takeaways/\">trade</a> for <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2017/04/05/two-ex-knicks-in-derrick-rose-trade-finding-niche-in-chicago/\">two players</a> with too many miles on their legs. A replay of the disastrous win-now <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/05/nba-draft-lottery-2017-boston-celtics-why-lottery-pick-awful-trade-brooklyn-nets-kevin-garnett-paul-pierce-breakdown\">strategy</a> of the Nets, which <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/26/15875468/d-angelo-russell-press-conference-nets-future-lottery-pick\">now</a> have them in solid rebuilding mode. Win-now is a shitty strategy, esp for the Knicks. Never has a team needed more to see itself as a work in progress. The thing the win-now proponents don't understand is that fans <i>like</i> teams with long-term strategies. They might bitch and moan about not winning or contending for a title, but a team with hope draws fan <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/02/25/thisThisIsWhyWeLikeBasketball.html\">interest</a>. A foolish team that makes shitty short-term bets? Well there are always other sports to watch. :baseball:",
