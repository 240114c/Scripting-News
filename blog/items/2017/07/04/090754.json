Someone who tells it like it is, but uses agreed-upon facts as opposed to making shit up. I had the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/882034441488564224\">thought</a> yesterday that Maxine Waters, if she had Twitter-fingers, could do the job. Here's what she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehill/status/882031723881656321\">said</a> when asked if she'd go easy on Ben Carson (presumably because he's a black man): \"I'm going to tear his ass apart.\" I like that. I think a lot of people would find that refreshing. (And no, she's not threatening violence. It's an <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=idiom\">idiomatic</a> expression.)",
