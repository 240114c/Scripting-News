    "text": "If you think the permanent division in our country's politics comes strictly from the right, here's pundit/lawyer Glenn Greenwald <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/882950499158372352\">saying</a> not to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/882950066033627137\">generous</a> with Republican pundit <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/02/15/davidFrumIsRightAboutTrump.html\">David Frum</a>, because we aren't generous with Republicans, even if we agree on Trump. That's the politics of division. That's the problem right there. We need to start listening, to everyone. Because you never know who your newest ally will be. I don't like Greenwald, it's true, and it's because he is one of the worst listeners I've ever encountered. Totally self-contained. Greenwald knows the truth, and can't learn anything from anyone. (My politics and his are pretty well aligned btw, which I know from reading his columns.)",
