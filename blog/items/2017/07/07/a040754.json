    "text": "Wyoming really has a fraction of the population of a NYC borough. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Queens#General_statistics\">Queens</a>, the second most populous borough had 2.2 million people in the 2010 census. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/WY/PST045216\">Wyoming</a> at the same time had only 564K. Even more ridiculous, three <a href=\"https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/appendix/neighborhoodpop.htm\">neighborhoods</a> in Queens combined have a greater population than Wyoming: Flushing, Jackson Heights and Jamaica.
