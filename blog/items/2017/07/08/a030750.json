When I first met him it was personal computers. He was founding editor of PC Magazine, and famously left, with most of his staff, to found PC World, over a dispute with the publishers. He did a deal with Steve Jobs to do a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macworld\">magazine</a> for the Mac, it shipped the day the Mac was announced. There was a copy of the first edition on every seat in Flint Center on 1/24/84.",

Then last year he got pancreatic cancer, and within months he died.  He had just finished a book. Was about to go out on tour when the disease hit. All that was put aside. He wondered what would happen with his causes after he was gone, I heard. ",

I gave a talk about the origins of podcasting at a podcasting conference in April. Someone said it had never occured to them that someone must have invented it. And here I was thinking they all were reverent of the genius of the simplicity and how much it had grown and managed to stay out of the control of the tech industry, so far at least. Apparently I'm one of very few people who are even aware that there was an act of creation, much less understood the miracle of its growth and utility, and independence. ",
