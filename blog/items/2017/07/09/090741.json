I stumbled across this doc when I was looking for an explanation of guids for the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a020936\">piece</a> about the blog bugfix. The first part was so good, I wondered why I had no memory of it. Then I got to the second part. The attacks were ugly, personal and awful and that's what I had put out of my mind, and I never wanted to point to this piece for fear of inviting more abuse. But the <a href=\"http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/stories/storyReader$1744#discontinuities\">first</a> and <a href=\"http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/stories/storyReader$1744#rss20AndWeblogSoftware\">last</a> parts were good, and \"RSS 2.0\" went on to be a juggernaut. And that's most of what I wanted. ",
