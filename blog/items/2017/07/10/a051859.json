    "text": "An example of a feed that <a href=\"http://rss2.io/code/feedtools/feedviewer/?server=river5.scripting.com&url=http://feeds.feedburner.com/PoliticalWire\">looks great</a> is Political Wire. Good length stories, not too much markup, links are included. I've always liked Political Wire, they summarize important political stories, and save you from having to click through a paywall to use up one of your monthly reads. ",
