Russia is run for the benefit of 44 people. They are the ones targeted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act\">Magnitsky Act</a>. They hate it because what they're about first and foremost is making money for themselves. They don't care about Russia. So the deal they were proposing to DJT Jr was this. We win you the election and you kill the Magnitsky Act. We all plunder together. \"Love it!\" says Junior. And the US govt is now run for the benefit of the Trump Family. This is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\">Occam's Razor</a> explanation. ",
