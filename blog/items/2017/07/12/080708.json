They already have the Democratic emails. So how to monetize them? This meeting probably was among the first official meetings. Trump had been meeting with Russian surrogates for months. But this was official. She listened, they heard what Trump want and gave it to him. Remember the emails did leak. That's what Junior said he wanted. Now you have to connect the dots. Find more meetings later in the summer and into the fall.",
