            "text": "How do you know the Russian lawyer didn't bring the dirt? My guess is she did. In June 2016, Trump has the nomination. Putin knows he can't work with Clinton. <i>He wants the sanctions lifted. </i>They already have the Democratic emails. How to monetize them? This meeting probably was among the first official meetings between Russia and Trump. Trump had been meeting with Russian surrogates for months, perhaps unknowingly. But this was official. The lawyer listened, heard what Trump wants and they gave it to him. Remember the emails <i>did</i> leak. That's what Junior said he wanted. Now you have to connect the dots. Find more meetings later in the summer and into the fall. Collusion is hardly the issue. Whether they broke the law, not the issue. <i>They sold out our country. </i>That should piss everyone off. ",
