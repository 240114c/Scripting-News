If Trump had aided the Taliban in their fight against the US, that would be treason. If he helped ISIS plan an attack, that would be treason. If he gave North Korea a map of safe hiding places for government officials, that might not actually be treason because we're not currently at war, but there's no doubt it's a betrayal of the country.
