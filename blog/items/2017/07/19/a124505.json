    "text": "I wonder how much carbon is dumped into the atmosphere because we don't have basic train service between cities in the US. For example, I was looking at taking an Amtrak from NYC <a href=\"https://www.wanderu.com/en/train-tickets/us-ny/new-york/us-tn/nashville/\">to</a> Nashville, thought that would be an interesting trip, well there is no Amtrak service to Nashville. You can take a train to Chicago and get on a bus. ",
