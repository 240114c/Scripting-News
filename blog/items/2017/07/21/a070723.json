So how do I search for all theaters in Manhattan that are showing that movie, and the showtimes, and the address of the theater. That used to be one click in Google Movies. ",

Impossible to get the info you need, and it's incredibly slow. There must be a money-making reason for it. It makes it hard to find a movie in a theater to watch. To just daydream about what's available. Sometimes I used to go to a movie just because there was nothing else that interested me. I never do that anymore because they make it so hard to scan the listings. This, from an industry who feels imperiled by Netflix and piracy. Please. How much could it cost to solve this problem? How much revenue would it generate?",
