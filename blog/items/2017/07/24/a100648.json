In my initial report, I included ALL THE INFO that the support rep asked for in the response. In the interim I just reprovisioned the server. It seems the error message could have told me which file it was having problems with and I could have fixed the permissions on that file. Instead I waited 48 hours to get a polite robotic answer. Which led me to wonder if it was a person or a bot who I was communicating with. In any case a complete failure in support from the diagnostic produced by the software to the work done by whoever or whatever was repping you.",
