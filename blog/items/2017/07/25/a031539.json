            "text": "Last week when everyone was delivering incredible pre-eulogies about John McCain I was thinking, yeah this isn't the John McCain I know. The one I know is a spineless spitballer who, when the economy melted down while he was running for president suspended his campaign and then had no idea what to do. So he called a huge meeting at the White House, and he still had no clue, so Barack Obama took charge and told everyone what to do, and basically told them the right things. McCain makes a big deal about supposedly being a straight-talker, but he's lazy and he's mostly a self-admiring cowardly bullshitter. Maybe he showed true grit when he was in the Navy, but as a politician he's strictly a bench warmer, not a leader. Also everyone conveniently forgets he was caught in a huge <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keating_Five\">bank scandal</a> in the 80s. He's not all that honest in other words.",
