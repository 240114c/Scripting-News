    "text": "I picked up a CitiBike this afternoon and it wasn't properly docked. I could have taken it home and no one would have known. I imagine the poor person who thought they docked it was wondering what would happen. Would they end up owning the bike? No worries, I docked the bike for them, after taking it to my destination. Everyone wins. I got a free ride. Well I would have gotten a free ride anyway, because I have an unlimited card. But I still feel like I won! :cop:",
