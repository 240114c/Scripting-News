    "text": "The <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/\">BloggerCon blog</a> at Harvard seems to be gone. Pictures from the NH field trips were there (pointed to from Betsy's blog). Archive.org <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20031002232528/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/picsEdwardsDeanNH\">has</a> the page, but many of the pictures are missing. But the pictures themselves are <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/static/bloggerCon/\">preserved</a>. The ones of the campaign events begin with DSC. However I thought all the original blogs at Harvard were preserved? This is not a good sign. There was a fair amount of history preserved there. It was an academic project, so it's not cool that our work is gone. ",
