Already there were signs of independence in the party, like the three senators who voted against their \"health care\" bill. And the veto-proof sanctions bill. ",

The question of which party is the majority party is up for grabs. The president has a huge chunk of the electorate if you view it as separate from the Republican Party. Like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perot\">Ross Perot</a>. But this time Perot won. The old Republican Party, the one Trump is splitting off of is smaller, at least for now, it seems to me. ",

Things had become kind of lulled unsettling, we were all getting on with our lives somewhat. Now it's about to get hairy again. ",
