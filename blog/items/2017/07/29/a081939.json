    "text": "Today is my friend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls\">Doc's</a> 70th birthday. I knew the guy when he was very young relative to what he is today which is unspeakably old. I remember when my grandfather was 70 and I thought holy shit that guy is old. Of course I've gotten older too as Doc has aged. But I try not to think about that. Instead I think of how old Doc has gotten. A real shame. :umbrella: ",
