The 8PM show was not quite as awful as I remembered. Lots of speeches as characters who had never met explain themselves. The writing was awful, stiff and unnecessary. ",

Something like <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-know-nothing-jon-snow\">Ygritte</a> and Jon Snow. Real chemistry. All of a sudden Daenerys Stormborn has met her match. I was totally afraid Jon Snow was going to bend the knee, but a guy who's been resurrected probably thinks about these things differently. :angel:",

It had an erotic feel. At that moment I almost tweeted a question, do you think they'll be in bed before the end of this episode or the next? Or will the season end with them in bed. And what about the moment when they realize that the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms is really Jon Snow's auntie. Haha. They're going to do this well. They're not going to blow it. This is the moment we're all waiting for. Don't. Blow. It.",
