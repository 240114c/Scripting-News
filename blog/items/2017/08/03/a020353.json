    "text": "Thinking about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kelly\">General Kelly</a> today. Assumption -- he's an honorable person. He's also now inside at the White House. There isn't anything that's secret from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff\">Chief of Staff</a>. So how long before the complete picture of the criminality of this White House is revealed to him? Hard to believe it hasn't already happened. So if he's honorable, he has to come clean, make a statement to the special prosecutor and ask for instructions. If not that, is there a backroom deal? Can't imagine there is. Who would want to make one if they didn't have to. Priebus was a clown, in way over his head. Kelly has had a chance to watch it from the Cabinet and he chose to go in. Puzzling.",
