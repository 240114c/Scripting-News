They can't handle news like  the <a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/2017/08/08/trump-issues-threat-north-korea/\">escalation</a> that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/08/08/trump-vows-north-korea-will-be-met-with-fire-and-fury-if-threats-continue/\">Trump</a> took in possible nuclear war with <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/reports-north-korea-produced-nuclear-warhead-fits-in-missile\">North Korea</a>. There really isn't anything else to talk about now. It doesn't matter what the president's approval rating is or whether Congress will flip in 2018. The president did something you can't do: openly, publicly, threatening to nuke North Korea. Now he has no good choices. Obviously if he launches nukes unprovoked, there's a good chance China or someone else will nuke us back. You think they'd just sit still for that? Or he has to back down. Great. Now what. There goes the nuclear <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory\">deterrent</a>, not just with North Korea but with Pakistan, India, all the other countries that have nukes but haven't announced. The current format of news, amped-up sensationalism about trivia, doesn't scale to this level. <i>We need a new kind of news, right now. </i>I will try Maddow later. ",
