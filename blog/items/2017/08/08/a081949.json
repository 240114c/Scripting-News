    "text": "In the New Republic, Jeet Heer <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/144217/stop-pretending-trump-can-saved\">quotes</a> Robert Bear, a supposed expert on aging in men: \"When was the last time you saw a 70-year-old man change for the better?\" This is a bit of miserably prejudiced nonsense, as crazy as any thought as anyone has ever been fired for. What he really means: He doesn't think Trump will change (I don't either, but I have been surprised) so he slammed a whole class of innocent people, many of who <i>do</i> change after 70. Turns <a href=\"http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/presse/informationen/fup/2014/fup_14_327-persoenlichkeitsentwicklung-studie-jule-specht/index.html\">out</a> <i>people over 70 change more than people between 30 and 70. </i>How about that. Now let's not fire Bear or Heer (both men, btw), as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo\">Google did</a> with their politically incorrect male employee, but please work on your prejudice.
