    "text": "Ever get a phrase stuck in your head and you find yourself saying it over and over silently, sometimes, and audibly others? Today, for me, that phrase is the name <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Dresselhaus\">Millie Dresselhaus</a>. There's a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ6_fOX7ITQ\">commercial</a> on TV that imagines that everyone is saying her name all the time in weird ways and places. She's a real person. Unfortunately it turns out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/science/mildred-dresselhaus-dead-queen-of-carbon.html?_r=0\">she died</a> earlier this year. I am sorry.",
