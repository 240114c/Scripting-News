    "text": "Venture capitalist Bijan Sabet <a href=\"http://bijansabet.com/post/164177979693/catastrophically-bad-judgment\">says</a> \"people in the workplace should not face any form of discrimination for their own personal politics and preferences.\" I agree, strongly. But then he struggles with what it means when Peter Thiel, a board member of Facebook supports Trump. I felt that Facebook should fire Thiel as a board member because his views about free speech are in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/nick-denton-peter-thiel-plot-to-murder-gawker\">conflict</a> with Facebook's mission. But I also objected strenuously when Brendan Eich was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26868536\">forced out</a> at Mozilla because he gave money to an org that opposed gay marriage in California, before the Supreme Court ruled on it. I could see how Thiel's actions re Gawker presented a problem for Facebook, but I felt that Mozilla and the tech industry blew the Eich call.",
