    "text": "Another good day of programming. Still working on <a href=\"http://instantdave.com/\">Instant Dave</a>.  Lots more functionality in the second iteration. One thing I must have is the ability to update. If an item on my blog updates, it must also update in the Instant Dave interface. I often edit after I post initially. Correct spelling, tighten up the wording. Add links. These should all flow through to the people who are reading my stuff in Instant Dave. ",
