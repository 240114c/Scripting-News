When they started airing his full press conference I switched to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order\">Law & Order</a> rerun. By the time Maddow was over it was just one more thing. She did run a clip of Fox, when first processing the press conference. It was cause for hope. But of course by the morning I'm sure they've reconnected with their bosses, found their spin, and are ready for another day of look-away.",
