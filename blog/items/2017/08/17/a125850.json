    "text": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pbump\">Philip Bump</a>, a friend from <i>Ye Earlie Blogging Dayse</i> did a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trumps_feed\">bot</a> that RTs everything Donald Trump sees in his Twitter timeline. No wonder the guy is so hyper (Trump, not Bump). This led me to a business model that Trump himself would appreciate. Let me buy ads aimed at a specific user. Let's load up Trump's timeline with messages of Trump-Love. We love you Dear Leader. We love you <i>soooo</i> much. And then tell him what we want him to do. :heart:",
