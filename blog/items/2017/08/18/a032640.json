    "text": "For some crazy reason I'm tempted to go down to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Square_Park\">Washington Square Park</a> tomorrow to observe the Nazis. I'm guessing most of them come from Staten Island and New Jersey, maybe some from out on the Island. Tomorrow also is the final <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/home/home.shtml\">Summer Streets</a> bike ride from 7AM to 1PM starting at Park Ave and 72nd St, through 4th Ave and onto Lafayette St, to the Brooklyn Bridge. Nazis coming by car should be aware that there will be limited cross-town access. Anyway, Summer Streets riders end up pretty close to Washington Square Park which tomorrow is Nazi-Land in NYC.",
