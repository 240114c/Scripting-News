Right off the bat you know it's bullshit, because if it were a real security issue, how could they justify waiting until October?",

The archive pages from the blog in this period, in 2006, eleven years ago, are still there. Here are <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2006/10.html\">the</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2006/09.html\">examples</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2006/07/18.html\">they</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2006/11.html\">cited</a>. The forms don't work, the search engine is long-gone. They're afraid someone will type their SSN in that form and it will be observed and recorded by an intermediary. On a decade-old archive page.",
