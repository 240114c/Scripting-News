    "text": "In September of last year, Evan Osnos wrote a <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/26/president-trumps-first-term?currentPage=all\">piece</a> in the New Yorker that imagined what the beginning of a Trump presidency would look like. I wanted this to be the beginning of a thread in journalism, give us an idea of what we were getting into. But the focus remained on Trump's outrageousness and the Russian leaks about Hillary. We blew it. Now I'd like to see a new thread that imagines what the sequence of events might be from here-out assuming Trump stays in office and his militia grow in power and the violence escalates.
