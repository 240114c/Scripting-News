If there were any preachers whose congregations were not Christian whites from the south, they would have gotten off last week. These so-called religious leaders need to have scapegoats I guess. Doesn't seem very holy to me. Who's responsible for the suffering of white people? Everyone who's of a different religion, or if they're black or hispanic. They have everyone covered. We're all keeping the Master Race down, so they can be more masterful and less depressed. They've been doing this for centuries. Maybe even millenia.",
