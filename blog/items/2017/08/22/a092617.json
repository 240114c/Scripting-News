    "text": "Another disgusting thing Repubs do is something new and innovative I hadn't seen any of them do until our current VP, Mike Pence did, as he debated the Democratic VP candidate whose name I have forgotten (isn't that how it always works). Now I remembered. His name is Tim Kaine. Haha. Anyway, what Pence does is lie about something Trump said. \"He never said that,\" but he does it in a remarkably condescending way. Kind of like Reagan saying \"There you go again.\" Except Kaine was telling the truth! Over and over, he did it. Kaine had been prepped I guess, to expect this. ",
