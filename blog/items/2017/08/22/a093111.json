The other day in an interview he said that Trump didn't create a false equivalence between Nazi and KKK rioters and peaceful protestors in Charlottesville, who were attacked by the Nazis and KKKs. \"Of course he didn't create a false equivalence,\" says Pence, looking disgusted at the lies he has to put down.
