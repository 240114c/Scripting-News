    "text": "When Doc was starting his <a href=\"http://doc.weblogs.com/\">blog</a> in 1998 or so,  it took about six months for it to catch on. I was regularly pointing to Doc from my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">blog</a>, because his writing was so good and perspectives about the net so valuable. Six months. You have to show people steadiness. Update even if they aren't reading in the numbers you'd like. Keep doing it. It takes time to build up a trust, a pattern, a habit. And that's what reading a blog is, a habit. Conclusion: If there's a will to reboot blogging, we have to create that kind of habit, across a number of sites. ",
