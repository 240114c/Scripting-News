I think Cleveland got the better deal. Kyrie Irving is a solid superstar, but I don't think he drives other players to perform. Not like the guy they traded for, Isaiah Thomas. He's a force of nature. I guess the Celtics thought he would burn out fast and Kyrie will last a while and will like staying in Boston. Cleveland is destined to be volatile. But it'll be interesting to watch Thomas and LeBron team up. Two very different kinds of players.",
