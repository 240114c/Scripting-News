    "text": "There's a new version of \"instant dave\" this morning. A complete rewrite. Lots of new features. New <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2017/08/22/stillDiggin.png\">look</a>. The same flow as before, but now the posts from \"Scripting News\" can update. There's a list of previous posts arranged vertically. I started with the code in <a href=\"http://screen2.io/\">screen2.io</a>. You can <i>Like</i> a post. And you can write your own posts. Only you and I will see them for now, other people will just see what they post and what I post. It's called Instant <i>Dave</i> after all. Hope you give it a try. If you have feedback, please post a comment <a href=\"http://instantdave.com/#1501260201000\">here</a>. ",
