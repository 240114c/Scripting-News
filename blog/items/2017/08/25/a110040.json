    "text": "BTW, I think \"Instant Dave\" is a prototype for other Instants. I want each of the news sites that I'm most <s>addicted to</s> connected to to have one. I'd keep an app open on my desktop for Qz, TPM, Axios, Maddow, as examples, esp if they included links from other pubs, analogous to my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/links.html\">linkblog</a>. There should be a competiton for a semi-exclusive connection to people I think of as news mongers. People who have a voracious appetite for new useful non-salacious info.  ",
