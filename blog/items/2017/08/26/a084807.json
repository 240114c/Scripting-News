    "text": "A couple of days ago I tried using <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/\">Paypal</a> to send money to a friend via her email account. She never got the notification, however I did get a confirmation via email. According to their website, the money has been paid. To who?  I tried to use their system to ask what happened to my money. But they keep rejecting the message without explanation. I checked my bank account, and the money has been withdrawn. I tried posting a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/901145547553337344\">query</a> to Twitter, it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskPayPal/status/901146761493749760\">responded</a> to by @AskPayPal, a verified account. They asked me to send a DM. I did. I have heard <i>nothing</i> back from them. This is unacceptable. Paypal depends on users trusting them. I used their service to send money, it appears to have never gotten there and they won't respond to a query. I could write it off, I could -- but then I also could never use their service again. ",
