    "text": "Two compelling lifestyle fantasies. An Italian <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/abroad/italian-ghost-town-sale-entire-village-available-less-price/\">ghost town</a> you can buy for â‚¬250K, or a Joshua Tree <a href=\"https://la.curbed.com/2014/1/31/10148482/breathtaking-joshua-tree-supervillain-lair-for-sale-for-first-time-1\">art house</a> for $3 million. I used to have fantasies of living in places like these. To the person who lives in the town by themself or in the beautiful desert house far away from everything, show them a picture of an apartment building in NYC and point to one window and say \"you could live here\" and they'd get all excited about all the people they would see every day just by walking around. The grass is always greener on the other side, happiness is always just around the corner.",
