And you can tell that the people he interviews, who are all <a href=\"http://nytimesriver.com/\">NYT</a> reporters, feel that way too. It wasn't like that at first. I don't think they knew why they were doing it. Now I think the Daily must be catching on inside the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nyt\">NYT</a>. The reporters are all very different people. Yesterday's was especially illuminating. I love seeing a venerable old newspaper transition to another great new medium. To help define that medium. It continues to be a great podcast. Mazel tov.",
