    "text": "I am a man of many mottos. Like \"Don't slam the door on your way out\" or \"It's even worse than it appears.\" The new one is about parties. I don't care how someone got to the party, as long as you're here, I'm your fellow party-goer. (Too long to be a motto, I know.) The net culture really needs to absorb this one. The punishment should fit the crime. Joel Osteen didn't open his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakewood_Church\">Houston church</a> to people made homeless by Hurricane Harvey. Twitter and Facebook exploded in rage. He relented. Now it's time to stop <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/joel-osteens-megachurch-says-it-didnt-open-its-doors-to?utm_term=.pwKzOw52v#.ttoB03p2N\">complaining</a>. He came to the party. He's helping. If you're still giving him shit, <i>you</i> have become the problem. ",
