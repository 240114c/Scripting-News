Set up newsrooms in places where the victims are and let them write the news. Make sure their story gets through <i>directly</i> to people outside Houston. Their thoughts are potentially very interesting. I sometimes have to turn off the sound on TV accounts because the words are so insipid. Usually from paid reporters. But I watch because the images are so astonishing. ",
