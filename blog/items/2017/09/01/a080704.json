    "text": "If you were using <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/files-folders/public-folder\">Dropbox's public folder feature</a>,  it stopped working earlier today, about five hours ago. The change was announced long in advance, but today was the day it actually stopped working. I was using the public folder of my Dropbox in a few of my apps. It was a great feature, a kind of interprocess communication for Everyman. I wish they had gone the other way and enhanced it, but I understand that it wasn't in their longterm direction. However it is important in <i>my</i> longterm direction. I'm working on a desktop product called <a href=\"http://publicfolder.io/\">Public Folder</a> that does more or less what it used to do. I plan to share the product. ",
