    "text": "All of a sudden <a href=\"http://www.techmeme.com/170901/p1#a170901p1\">reporters realize</a> that Google pushes people around and suppresses ideas they find threatening. As I like to say \"it's even worse than it appears.\" I've been reporting this here since the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/\">inception</a> of this blog in 1994. Google continues a long tradition of tech companies holding back progress to maintain their dominance.  The web and blogging and have allowed us to circumvent this, to some extent. BTW, of course it's not just Google. There's a continuous chain of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt\">bullshit</a> tech companies going back to the beginning. They all do it.  ",
