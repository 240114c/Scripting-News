    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_Dan\">Steely Dan</a> was a favorite of mine in a wonderful and uplifting period of my life, when I was a grad student in <a href=\"https://www.cs.wisc.edu/\">Madison</a> in the mid-late 70s. I was finally an adult, in love, lots of friends and accomplishments everywhere. Firing on all cylinders. One of the most prime periods of my life. I guess I'm going to listen to a lot of Steely Dan in the next few weeks. Kind of the way we listened to a lot of Prince last year.

We all were friends with him through their creativity.  ",
