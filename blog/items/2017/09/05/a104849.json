    "text": "I put flowers on my blog today to honor the life of Ted Rheingold, who died yesterday. Cancer. He wrote about it <a href=\"https://medium.com/season-of-the-witch\">on the web</a>, of course. A natural-born blogger. Apparently Ted asked for a new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jw/status/904941100644818945\">laptop sticker</a>, and it's a good one. Looks like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clematis\">clematis</a> flower with a simple message -- <i>Enjoy Every Day. </i>",
