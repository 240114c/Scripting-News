    "text": "Dropbox was quite close to the idea of <i>Public Folder, </i>but once it became popular they pulled back from it. As I understand it, if you created your account after 2012, you didn't have a public folder. I did, because I was an early adopter. It was good, but had missing features, which I lamented here on this blog many-a-time. If only they had seen Dropbox as a publishing platform, but they didn't. They finally turned the feature off on Sept 1, four days ago.",
