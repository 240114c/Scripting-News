    "text": "Another precursor of <i>Public Folder</i> was upstreaming in Radio UserLand, released in 2002.

Radio had a CMS built in. This time around I have created that as a separate module. I'm pretty sure any static site generator that runs where Node runs will be compatible with Public Folder. ",
