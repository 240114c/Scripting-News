She has emerged from Burning Man, so my work appears to be finished with the <a href=\"http://this.how/burnerNews/\">Burner News</a> page. A bunch of stuff happened while the Burners were offline: Trump's transgender ban, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, Hurricane Harvey destroyed Houston, the fourth-largest American city, North Korea launched an ICBM-like missile over Japan, Mattis decided for now transgender troops will stay, a Utah nurse is arrested for preventing police from taking blood from an unconscious patient (an important story, more so since Jen is from Utah), Walter Becker of Steely Dan died, North Korea tested a hydrogen bomb, Trump rescinds DACA, Hurricane Irma is heading towards Miami, Hurricane Jose is right behind it.",
