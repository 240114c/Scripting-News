    "text": "A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/905677632225763328\">magnificent thread</a> on how JavaScript got its name. Gets me thinking about paths not-taken. Frontier is of course built around a language and a database. I wanted to call the language Juicy, because it was like C, and Doug and I are Jewish. I was voted down. Too colorful I guess. But I <a href=\"http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2009/10/13/17.jpg\">like</a> color in my product names.  ThinkTank was probably my best name, and I didn't even come up with it. Mike Conner, a guy from Apple, in 1982, came up with it. Those were the days. I think Public Folder might be a pretty good name. Although I really love Small Picture. I still have the domain of course. ",
