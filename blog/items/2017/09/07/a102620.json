    "text": "A funny thing happens when I criticize the <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc-live-ari-melber\">Ari Melber show</a> on Twitter, I sometimes get a response from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AriMelber\">Ari Melber</a>. I wonder if it's <i>Melber Actual</i> typing. Yesterday he had a bit about an important Trump appointee and the guests were smart and had a lot to say, but they cut that short to do segment on dating in the Age of Trump which I think is ridiculous. BTW, it appears Trump has <a href=\"https://www.bna.com/trump-pick-top-n73014464231/\">appointed</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Dreiband\">someone</a> to run Civil Rights at DOJ who is like his appointment to run the EPA, someone opposed to the idea of civil rights. If there's more to know about this, I want to know it. ",
