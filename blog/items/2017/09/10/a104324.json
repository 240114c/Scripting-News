    "text": "Assuming the republic survives Trump, the next president we elect will likely be the opposite of Trump, that is -- not a celebrity, not flamboyant, an insider, someone who will shut up and do the job. So when you hear the Dems should nominate someone like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hackteck/status/906887538215997442\">George Clooney</a> or even Al Franken, remember next time around we'll more likely want a bureaucrat, someone like Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. Let the government govern. Let's get the EPA back on track. Health care for everyone. Rejoin the Paris climate change accord. Etc etc.",
