One question came up, could we have a link from every archive page back to the home page? It turns out there is a link, it's at the top of the page. If you click on the name SCRIPTING NEWS it will take you to the home page. Here's a <a href=\"http:///scripting.com/images/2017/09/10/whereToClickToGoHome.png\">screen shot</a>. Some things are so \"in your face\" you can't see them. Happens to me all the time. ",
