    "text": "It's a good day to think about web history. There was a lot of news on this day <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2001/09/11.html\">16 years ago</a>. My archive for that day is still here, but many of the sites I linked to that day are gone. \"I've tried to sound the alarms. Every day we lose more of the history of the web. Every day is an opportunity to act to make sure we don't lose more of it. And we should be putting systems into place to be more sure we don't lose future history.\" I wrote that <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/09/11/aGoodDayToThinkAboutWebHistory.html\">two years ago</a>. We're not doing better, we're doing worse. This is the web equivalent of climate change. Every non-backward-compatible \"improvement\" to the web kills more archives. ",
