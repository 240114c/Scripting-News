Like this. \"Are journalists more likely to view Amazon in positive light now that Bezos owns the Post? Perhaps even subconsciously?\" Yes, of course. Because journalists love to get paid. (As we all do.) It's the ultimate form of recognition. Now Bezos is not only in a position to reward journalists, he is able to endow a journalist with enough money so you can do things that have nothing to do with making money. He can put you on the Woodward-Bernstein platform.  Bezos is A-number-one-journalism-sugardaddy right now. The previous #1 was Pierre Omidyar, but now not so much because his once-promising journalism venture didn't turn out to be all that great. ",
