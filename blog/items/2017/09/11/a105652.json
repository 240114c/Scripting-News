    "text": "I have another story to tell about influencing journalists. In the 80s I ran a commercial software company, we advertised in most of the industry weeklies. I noticed that the adjectives we used to describe our product were turning up in stories the journalists wrote about us. Journalists read the ads in their own pubs. Not surprising, nor wrong. But I doubt most journalists would admit it. ",
