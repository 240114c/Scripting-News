    "text": "I'm working on a new version of the \"Scripting News\" home page. It has three tabs, Blog, Links and About. I was able to bring the tabs back without making too much mess. I really want a clean reading experience. The other big change is that it will now require JavaScript be turned on. I can't keep two versions going and do all the other stuff I have to do. Pretty much everything on the web requires JS nowadays, and there is the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">RSS feed</a> that has full text of everything, so you will be able to read the blog if you really want to.
