    "text": "Update at 12:40PM Eastern: I replaced the old JS and CSS files with the new ones that support the tabbed home page. Here's an example of a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/09/\">month archive</a> page, and a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/09/08.html\">day archive</a> page. They seem to work. I see a few CSS glitches. (The color of the wedges on the Twitter inclusions are wrong.) I still have to add the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/25#issuecomment-328613821\">fix</a> for arrow keys and Page Up and Down. ",
