    "text": "I'm halfway through the second episode of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozark_(TV_series)\">Ozark</a>. It's very weird, for sure. But it's very much a network type TV show, even though there is nudity, strong language, violence. I don't know if they can keep up the pace. My experience with shows that start really fast is that they run out of gas around the middle of the season. I'll keep you posted.",
