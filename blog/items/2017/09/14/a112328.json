I had a router ten or so years ago called <i>Google Public Wifi. </i>It was rumored that Google was going to deploy a huge free public wifi network in the Bay Area. I lived in an apartment in downtown Berkeley. I was hoping to start a rumor, maybe get it into Gizmodo or something, but it didn't happen. ;-)",
