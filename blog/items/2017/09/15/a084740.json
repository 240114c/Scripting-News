    "text": "On <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/19214.html\">today's Daily podcast</a>, an interview with Bernie Sanders about his bill to provide Medicare for everyone. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/insider/inside-the-daily-with-michael-barbaro.html?mcubz=1&_r=0\">host</a> asks why introduce the bill if it has no chance of passing. \"You have to start somewhere.\" I agree. Obama always prenegotiated. Instead of saying what he really wanted, he proposed a compromise. The Repubs took advantage. Bernie says go for what you want. Accept less if you have to, but that's where the negotiating starts. Also gives Dems something to campaign on in 2018 and 2020. Good move. ",
