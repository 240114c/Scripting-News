    "text": "JavaScript is getting <a href=\"https://blog.pragmatists.com/top-10-es6-features-by-example-80ac878794bb\">too big</a>. I wish that the Ecmascript working group, instead of adding more obscure features that <i>people will use</i> (and therefore I have to understand to be able to follow their code), would work on a profile (or subset) of the language, that includes one construct to do everything, and no more. One way to write a function, for example. No conditional assignment (even though I use it, and think it's clearer in some cases). Languages that get too <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat\">big</a> become dinosaurs more quickly. What was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)\">name</a> of that language that was supposed to replace C and Pascal because it had everything everyone could ever want?
