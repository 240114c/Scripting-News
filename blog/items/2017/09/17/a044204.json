    "text": "An idea for Citibike. When you return the bike you <a href=\"http:///scripting.com/images/2017/09/17/ideaforcitibike.png\">get an email</a>. If the bike needs repair, there should be a place on the confirming email where you can report the problem. (Especially if you return the bike one minute after checking it out at the same station.)",
