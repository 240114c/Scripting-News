It's like having a death in the family, or some kind of windfall of opportunity. It's a time for change. The assumption that we would change to fascism isn't the only way it can go. It could also turn out that the shakeup breaks the destructive partisanship in DC. Which is why, we as citizens of the US, who have an interest in support from government, also have an interest in bipartisanship.",
