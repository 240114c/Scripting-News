    "text": "Speaking of Citibike, they sent an email asking if I'd like to be part of their <a href=\"https://bikeangels.citibikenyc.com/\">Bike Angels</a> program. Yes, of course I would. You're basically part a human <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)\">load-balancer</a> for bike stations. There's an app that shows you which stations need bikes and which have too many. If you move a bike for them, you get reward points. With enough points you can give friends (visiting from out of town for example) free days of Citibike. I'm exactly the kind of person to pitch this to. I'll do anything to get more people on the bike paths in NYC.  ",
