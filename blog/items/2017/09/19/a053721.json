I even understand why, as I've bet the same way more or less. Governments are judged by two prices: gas and stock. If gas is down and stock is up, the president wins re-election. So guess what. Gas stays low and stock goes up. It's like free money, basically. Until there's a war or a bubble burst. But most of the time you just make money with an index fund. Now you have the secret too. :apple:",
