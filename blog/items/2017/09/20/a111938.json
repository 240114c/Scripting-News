    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen\">Jay Rosen</a> <s>has been</s> is considering cross-posting to Medium. On Twitter he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/910508236423405569\">asked</a> if he should point to the Medium versions of his post or the <a href=\"http://pressthink.org/\">blog</a> version. I thought I'd answer on my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a111938\">blog</a>. It wouldn't make much difference to me. I read his blog through his feed, and I dislike going to Medium, because of the interstitial dialog that pops up before I can read a piece. So I guess it would annoy me to see a Medium link to Jay's posts, but I'd get over it. ",
