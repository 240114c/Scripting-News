That kind of implies that Shariah Law is being imposed on us. That's the joke. It isn't. They play the same ugly game with voter suppression (they <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/heritage-explains/voter-fraud\">call</a> it something else). And unmasking. I guess they must have been masked for a reason, you say. To protect someone. And to unmask them, well that's obviously bad, right? Haha. You fell for it. Even when you argue against it, saying it's harmless, you're falling for it. Maybe the best thing is to play along? Why were they masked in the first place? What were they hiding? Maybe you have to play the game to defuse it. Bottom line -- Repubs are scum. If you're a Repub and don't feel you're scum, maybe it's time to start something new. ",
