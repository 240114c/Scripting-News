It gave me a nauseous feeling when the first comment came in on Twitter, from a stranger, who said that <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/09/21.html#a094502\">unmasking</a> was bad and provided a link to support his belief. A bot. Even if he's flesh and blood, even if he thinks he's sentient, he's just human spam. This is the end of the line for discussion boards. We tried that a long time ago and blogging won out, for good reason. No. More. Cross-posting.",
