    "text": "Coming clean, I point to <a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/\">Political Wire</a> and <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/\">TPM</a> summaries of stories on NYT, WaPost and CNN so I don't drive traffic to their paywalls and to autoplay video that autoplays. It all keeps getting worse. I pay myself for the NYT, but still have to wait for ads to complete before I can read the stories I paid to read. Overall I'd much rather point to the original reporting. This is part of the malaise around web-based news. Just a part. It seems to me it has to be a fun and rewarding experience without gotchas before it can ask for money. ",
