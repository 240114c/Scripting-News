    "text": "Over on FB, sorry <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/31.html#a110526\">no link</a>, a friend posted a picture of a gorgeous autumn morning scene in New England. He wrote \"It is a heartbreakingly beautiful fall morning.\" I wrote in a comment:  I often wish it were possible to annotate a FB post with a comment to myself that no one else sees. Often someone else's message is a perfect place to make a note. Like in this case -- Why is it heartbreaking? I'm guessing for this reason -- because it's something you're going to miss when life is over. Or something you'd like to share with someone who's no longer here. Or something you <i>did</i> share with someone who's no longer here. In any case, this is just a note to myself. ;-)",
