    "text": "I grew up in the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens\">part</a> of NYC as Trump about 10 years later. Things hadn't changed much, for sure. There is a lot of racial prejudice among whites in Queens, esp re Puerto Ricans, which are a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_migration_to_New_York_City\">large minority</a> in NY. I was raised to believe many of the things Trump still believes. A lifetime of trying to keep my eyes and ears open and questioning assumptions has helped me undo some very wrong ideas. This is something Trump clearly has not done. ",
