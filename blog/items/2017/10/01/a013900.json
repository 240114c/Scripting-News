I still get my news from the major brands, only a few new ones have entered my zone of trust. And they are total gatekeepers. My number one frustration is the inability to join the discourse. I feel my ideas are good enough to be part of the flow, esp when there's so much boring repetition. For whatever reason it's impossible. And that's very frustrating. I don't know what the answer is but I think about it all the time. ",

She was unknown just a few days ago, and has said things that normally would never get through the gatekeepers. But she had what it takes. A big enough title to make her not such a risk, and an eloquence and directness that serves as a wonderful foil to the panic, cowardice and covering-up of El Presidentè. Her anger comes through, and it seems real, which is very unusual for TV news.",
