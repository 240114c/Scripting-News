It's a disclaimer. You're not getting full-strength Dave, you're getting a highly abbreviated version. I favor no limit, with a simple \"show more\" <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html\">link</a> on tweets over 140. I understand some people don't favor such a change, but imho they are wrong. :boom:",
