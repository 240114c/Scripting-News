I still get my news from the major brands, only a few new ones have entered my zone of trust. And they are total gatekeepers. My number one frustration is the inability to join the discourse. I feel my ideas are good enough to be part of the flow, esp when there's so much boring repetition. For whatever reason it's impossible. And that's very frustrating. I don't know what the answer is but I think about it all the time. ",
