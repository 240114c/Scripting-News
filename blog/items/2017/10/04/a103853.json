But if such a thing exists, I suspect it has something to do with aggregation, because we need it, and the current ways we get it are so inadequate and not near the potential of the Internet to deliver.",

What if there were a news aggregator that provided a customizable feed from many sources and only included vetted sources, known to at least be trying to present accurate news. I don't know if that's the wolf, but it's needed.",

We gave them a great start with \"RSS\". Now Facebook is to blame. All they did is ruthlessly harness the native power of the net, in a fairly crude first-approach sort of way. Lots more iteration and refinement is possible. To win it requires cooperation among the competitors in news, and that might be impossible. ",
