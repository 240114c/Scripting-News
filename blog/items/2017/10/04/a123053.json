Security on phones is terrible. If your phone is hijacked, the hackers could control of any two-factor account you have. And it's easy to talk a telco into giving you control of someone else's phone. Two-factor is a very misleading name. It's not two factors, it's the <i>weakest of</i> two factors. It's not <i>and</i> it's <i>or.</i>",
