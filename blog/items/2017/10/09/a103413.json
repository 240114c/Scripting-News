    "text": "Programming won't really take off as an art until we accept a certain basic set of tools that more or less remain constant. As long as the debate is at such a fundamental level as synchronous or asynchronous, and we keep flip-flopping back and forth, we'll never get to the next level of refinement. It's as if great cooks couldn't agree on knives, forks, spatulas, frying pans, collanders, etc. These tools have been around for centuries. Not that they haven't been evolving, but they do it slowly. We really do know at this point the basic tools of programming. There haven't been many new ideas in the time I've been active, and that's about as long as anyone.  ",
