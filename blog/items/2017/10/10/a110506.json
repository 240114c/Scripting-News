    "text": "Yesterday I did an interview with <a href=\"http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/author/brian-mccullough/\">Brian McCullough</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/\">Internet History Podcast</a>. We talked about many of the things you'd expect. When we got to podcasting, I realized his was exactly the kind of podcast I hoped would emerge when we did the work in the early-mid 2000s. Something that starts out as a hobby, a passion, an idea, and develops into real media with regular listeners. A <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html\">weblog for the ears</a> is what I called it back then. I'll let you know when the interview is available. ",
