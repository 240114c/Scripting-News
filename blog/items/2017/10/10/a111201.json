I might have to get my head examined. The Yankees <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/yankees-putting-pressure-cracking-indians-entering-game-5-article-1.3552646\">won</a>, btw. And oddly enough I find myself rooting for them (really need to see a doctor). Why? Well Cleveland is favored to win it all this year. And I love to see the favorites get knocked off their perch. Same reason I pull against the Warriors. That the Yankees are underdogs now doesn't really mean that I don't hate the concept of the Yankees. I do.",
