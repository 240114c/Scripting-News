    "text": "Another BTW, Brian thought, like virtually everyone I meet, that I am a Brooklyn boy. Not so. Why do they think that? Wikipedia incorrectly states that I am a Brooklyn native. I was born in a hospital in Brooklyn, that much is true. But I grew up in Queens. First in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens\">Jackson Heights</a>, and then in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburndale,_Queens\">north Flushing</a> (near Whitestone and Bayside). Ask anyone from Queens in that era if they came from Brooklyn (as I said on the podcast) and you're likely to get a (virtual) punch in the nose. And that, my friends, is where my hatred of the Yankees comes from. These days you see people wearing Yankees hats in Queens, but not when I lived there. ",
