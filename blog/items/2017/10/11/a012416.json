I remember there's a pretty good Mexican place with Margueritas. If you're doing a Boulder startup, tell me about it. I did office hours in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/08/28/theCommunitySystemForDemo.html\">2008</a> in Boulder with <a href=\"https://www.techstars.com/programs/boulder-program/\">Techstars</a> it was a lot of fun. We can talk about Node, browser-based apps, how to save the world from Trump, you know the usual stuff. :rocket: :boom:",
