    "text": "About Mike Ditka. He was <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a12814866/mike-ditka-no-oppression-100-years/?src=socialflowTW\">quoted</a> on a football show this week saying \"There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of.\"  I like the way he ended the quote, <i>that I know of</i> suggests that he might be open to knowing how there has been and continues to be oppression in America. He is mistaken. We all make mistakes. I feel we have to give everyone a chance to hear the other side. He seems to be open to it. My guess is he's hearing it now if he wants to continue to be a TV spokesperson during football games. If we're going to dig out of the hole we're in in this country, and racial oppression is a big part of it, it's going to involve a lot of patient listening and discussing, and trying to see it from the other person's point of view, no matter how wrong you think they are. This is a good time to test out those new muscles. It's how we recover from the deep hole we're in, as far as I know. ",
