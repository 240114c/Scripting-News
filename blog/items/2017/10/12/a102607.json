    "text": "\"Little Outliner\" tip: If you keep LO2 open all day every day, when you start work in the morning, reload the page. There's some kind of performance issue in the app that causes it to get slow if you leave it running too long. Reloading the page is the same as quitting and relaunching an app. \"Fargo\" didn't have this issue. I must be doing something differently, but I don't know what it is. <i>Still diggin!</i>",
