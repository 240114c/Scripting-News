    "text": "Idea for a new social net: Last night <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls\">Doc Searls</a> was in one of my dreams. I don't remember what we were doing. But it was nice to see him. What if there were a place I could go to record that event. And what if by chance Doc recorded that I was in <i>his</i> dream last night. Then we'd know there was some kind of cosmic connection. How would we know if we don't have an app for it?  :boom:",
