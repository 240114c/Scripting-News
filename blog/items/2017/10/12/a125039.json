Did she somehow think that a human being at Facebook could have been involved in the content of the ad or who it was targeted at? It's all based on keywords and pointers to stuff on the web. ",

We are a remarkably open society. They could read academic journals, or watch conferences on livestreams, or even go to the conferences. They could read Nate Silver and Jon Chait and many others, the same columnists that Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes read. Russia must have people who do what our CIA does. Read everything they can get their hands on and look for all kinds of changes and vulnerabilities. How do they think espionage works? You think they need help from Cambridge Analytica? Maybe there is a linkup there, I hope so -- but you're insulting our intelligence if you think the Russians can't carefully study us, the way we certainly study them.",
