    "text": "Best podcast I listened to was the Longform <a href=\"https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-265-michael-barbaro\">interview</a> of Michael Barbaro of the NYT Daily podcast. It has become the Visicalc of podcasts. I think everyone is listening to it. I don't miss an episode. He of course talked about the famous interview with the coal miner, but left out the best part, the thing he got dinged for the most (at least of what I heard) -- not challenging the guy on his opinion that coal didn't cause climate change. I totally supported that. I wanted to hear the guy's story and have the interviewer just let him say his piece. We know the arguments. It wouldn't have added anything to the story. Also, he defines the Daily as a podcast about the reporters who report the news. And the Longform interview was a podcsat about the podcast about the reporters who report the news. I wondered if another level is possible, but for now I couldn't imagine it. ",
