    "text": "Watched the first two episodes of Mr Mercedes, expecting it to be drek, and was surprised at how good it is. I knew the story because I read the book. The book started great and then like a lot of late Stephen King books got bogged down in smarmy bullshit. Most Stephen King movies/shows are crap, like the recent It. Some of them make great movies like The Shining, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption. This one is promising.  ",
