I wasn't going to backtrack to get coffee. They have it now. I wanted to pick up groceries before checking in. I searched for groceries, it gave me a chance to search on my route. It presented a list of choices along with how much time they'd add to my trip. A button next to each one offered to add it as a stop. Smooth as silk. Another bonus, Google Maps says \"Welcome to New Mexico\" a mile or so before you see the official sign. It was a surprise and made me laugh. I guess what's next is the Google Home interface for the Maps app.",
