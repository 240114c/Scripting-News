I was posting a link to this <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/john-mccains-final-act-is-war-against-trump.html\">fantastic piece</a> by Jon Chait about the last act of John McCain's political career. The software I use, a linkblogging tool I wrote called <a href=\"http://radio3.io/\">Radio3</a>, presents a random slogan above the edit box. The slogan was especially appropriate to the piece. Finally, hopefully before it's too late, McCain-the-Maverick is showing up. ",
