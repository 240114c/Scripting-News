    "text": "Trump claims his administration has accomplished more in its first nine months than any previous presidency. How foolish, he hasn't passed any laws. But there's an argument to be made that it's true. Read about the dismantling of the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/war-on-the-epa/\">EPA</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/state-department-trump/517965/\">State</a> <a href=\"https://play.radiopublic.com/the-daily-GMB3yp/ep/s1!e08eb916944f82c8a28e7a3ca802df894b1a736b\">Department</a>, and realize how long it will take to bring them back. Some people feel it's for the best that the US not have any controls on pollution or have any foreign presence. For them these are accomplishments. Trump may not know or care about what they're doing, that doesn't mean it's not part of a plan, that the Kochs and Mercers aren't intelligently looting the government. Things are happening faster than people may realize.  ",
