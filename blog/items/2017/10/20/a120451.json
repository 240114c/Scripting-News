The hard part was figuring out how to get people to do it!

In hindsight the killer app for RSS was the New York Times. Once we had them on board, in April 2002, with daily updates to their feeds, it built out to a news network that to this day is delivering far better results for news consumers than anything else, even Twitter or Facebook. True, most people don't get their news directly from RSS feeds. But the people who really care about news do. ",

At that point, we had enough examples for people to get the idea that they could do it too.  ",

Every time I see it I try to correct it. It's important because people who want to follow in the footsteps of RSS and podcasting, and develop open technologies, should know that there's more to it than technology. Without compelling content, that gets other people to do it, you don't even have a good demo. ",
