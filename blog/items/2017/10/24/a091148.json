Bob Corker (R-TN) gave an extraordinary interview to Savannah Guthrie on the Today Show.\"  What was so extraordinary? He told the truth. So much of what you hear on the news is lies that it's extraordinary when a politician says something so obviously true, any child could see.  Maybe we should take a step back and re-evaluate. Should we even let politicians on TV if all they're going to do is lie? What does that say about us as voters?",
