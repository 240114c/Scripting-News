    "text": "A \"Scripting News\" reader asks if I can pre-expand all the videos and tweets. I should have seen this coming. The answer is no. Sorry, actually it's yes, I <i>could</i> do it, but no, I won't. Let me put it another way. Would you want to have all your Christmas presents opened at the same time? Would you like to be able to eat all 12 candies in a box at the same time, or would it be better to savor each one for its taste, texture, presence, the thought that went into its placement in the box? These are little gifts. You don't have to open them to get the value. But I do it this way to have a little fun with the presentation. So sorry, this is the way it is. However, I like to get feature requests and bug reports. If you have one please use the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues\">issues section</a> on the repo for this site. Thanks! :-)",
