The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_Street%E2%80%93Hudson_Yards_(IRT_Flushing_Line)\">34th St</a> station on the 7 line. 2. The escalator connecting the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutphin_Boulevard%E2%80%93Archer_Avenue%E2%80%93JFK_Airport_(Archer_Avenue_Lines)\">E train</a> to AirTrain in Jamaica. It's weird but I'm only scared of falling when going down, not up.",
