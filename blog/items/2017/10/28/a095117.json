    "text": "My <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html\">MLK button</a> is coming back. I stopped wearing it a few months ago, but it's going back on my sweaters and jackets as fall is here. It's really a good idea. It says I am the kind of American who believes in respecting everyone regardless of the usual things that divide us: race, religion, gender, age -- basically appearance. I'm giving everyone a chance to be the good human that they are in their core. I felt the need originally, about a year ago, just after the election, when walking around in shell-shocked NYC, I felt people's eyes on me, and my eyes on them, wondering if they had voted for Trump, or them wondering if I had. Now, a year later it's a different question. I don't care if you voted for Trump. I want to know if you think there were <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/white-house-watch-trump-and-the-very-fine-people-who-march-with-neo-nazis/article/2009314\">very fine Nazis</a> marching in Charlottesville. I want to know that you won't be breaking windows on the American <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht\">Kristallnacht</a>, should it ever come, or lynching a black man, or tormenting women who work with you. These issues are all related, rooted in the same cause, and I want to root that out and destroy it, or at least make it go back into hiding. Wearing a symbol on my jacket says all this. I hope.",
