    "text": "Watched my first full World Series game of the year last night. A couple of observations, one lighthearted, and one dead serious. 1. As a Mets fan, I see a win in the Yankees loss in the previous round, esp if followed by a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/10/11/baseballGotUglyLastNight.html\">Dodgers</a> loss in the World Series. Almost as good as the Mets winning it all. Go Astros! 2. As an American who believes in the Constitution, I strongly believe God Bless America has no place in this game. Insisting that everyone stand and take off their hat while a soldier prays to your god, that's enough to get me to boycott baseball. It was wrong to start playing GBA after 9/11, but somewhat understandable. That was 16 years ago, come on MLB, open your doors to everyone, even people who think that religion, war and baseball don't have anything to do with each other.  ",
