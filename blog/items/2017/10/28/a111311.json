The panelists swirled all around what I feel is the obvious new direction for news. They must take responsibility for it, must define it. Letting tech define it results in Twitter and Facebook, neither of which are good at news. Twitter is sources. Facebook is friends. Both carry news, because there's a void, but not well. We should be much further ahead. News must create a new place for people who care to get vetted news. And become more inclusive of voices and ideas from outside their circle of comfort. Create an inclusive space that doesn't have deliberately misleading stories. This means also that news orgs are going to have to get the headlines in agreement with their stories. No more excuses about clickbait. News has waited for tech to lead them. That's the big mistake.",
