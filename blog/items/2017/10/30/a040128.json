I recorded this <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/10/30/aPodcastForMarco.m4a\">10-minute podcast</a> to explain what I had in mind, generally, not about specific products (it was a long time ago, the opportunity long-since passed). Most of the time when you knock on the door saying <i>here's a free idea,</i> people think you want something. But sometimes it goes somewhere and that's when really interesting stuff happens. This is worth talking about. ",
