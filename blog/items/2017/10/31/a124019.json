Was it a smokescreen, or is he really that bad. Imho yes he is really that bad. Two theories: 1. <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor\">Hanlon's Razor</a>: Never attribute  to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence and 2. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\">Occam's Razor</a>:  If you had to guess who Trump would choose as Chief of Staff, would it be a babysitter or a fellow white supremacist? There was a lot of wishful thinking behind the idea that Kelly was effective \"adult supervision.\" Now we're finding out what we should have assumed all along. He's just as much of a Nazi as Trump is.",
