    "text": "Good morning sports fans and congratulations to the Houston Astros and condolences for fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers. I have some suggestions for the Dodgers, but they'll wait until a proper period of grieving has taken place. Just know that it involves an apology and a retirement. And you might want to consider a new stadium. It worked wonders for the Mets after our stadium was defiled by the hated evil Yankees.",
