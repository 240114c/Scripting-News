Facebook is to blame. They should have known! But where were all the hard-charging investigative journalists during the campaign? They were taking the bait from Russians about Hillary's email. And Access Hollywood was soooo salacious. Ask if The Clintons are corrupt a few thousand times, and the question becomes moot. So now we're stuck with the NRA in the White House and WW III looming. Our whole system needs to have the money taken out of it. Until it is, journalism is in no position to point the finger. ",
