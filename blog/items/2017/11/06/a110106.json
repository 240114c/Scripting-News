    "text": "More Newsgeist -- the subject of the massive bit-burning that the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a100645\">turn to HTTPS</a> will cause did come up at one of the last sessions. I was getting the usual talking points from several participants from different organizations, the ones I get when this is discussed on Twitter. Since we had <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule\">Chatham House Rule</a> I can't say who they are. It was fun to get the pushback I always get when I write about it, in real time, face to face. It's all bullshit, masking the ridiculous power grab by Google and Mozilla. If HTTPS is so necessary, then selling it on its own merits should work fine, without destroying the history of the web. I'm kind of okay with Google using it as a \"signal\" to determine search rank, although it's a lie and makes me think very negatively of Google. But using their dominance of browserland to <i>force</i> this, there's no justification for that, and there should be a huge anti-trust outcry over it. If I have anything to say about it, there will. My blog may not have huge traffic, but I'll use whatever I have to expose this. They call me names, but it all amounts to one thing -- they don't want to be called out. I love the web, think it's very important, and only fascists want to destroy history. Google, you really are way out on a limb here.",
