    "text": "Lots of gender discussions. Earnest, well-intentioned, supportive, even at times loving. But most of it too dangerous for me, as a man, to write about in public. I will say this one thing. I heard the term \"mansplaining\" used several times, by people of both genders. I don't like it. I don't think you should either. <i>Man</i> is becoming a <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pejorative&t=hg&ia=definition\">pejorative</a> just as <i>Jew</i> was when I was growing up. I thought to be a Jew was dirty. I didn't want to be one, even though my family ran for their lives in the Holocaust, because we were Jewish. I both hated the term and myself. If the unfair effort to indict men, as a gender, continues, you're going to have a lot more angry self-hating men. If you think that's good you're crazy. You want to see how bad the term is. Imagine if the <i>man</i> in mansplaining were replaced with \"jew.\" It's a hateful term, and if you use it, you're spreading hate. And you gotta know that's going to come back on you. No way around it. Find another way to get a person, of any gender, to listen. Without resorting to awful humiliating gender-slamming tricks. ",
