    "text": "Re Google and antitrust, a little story. I have an Android phone. When it rings, if they think it's a spam caller, the screen goes red and there's a label under the number that says it's probably spam. I trust Google to not use this feature to censor political opinions, though technically they could, and we would never know. I want to believe they're saying it's spam because it <i>is</i> spam. The same way I trust Google not lower the rank of a site because it doesn't support HTTPS. The fact that they do this, and are <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\">open about it</a>, means I don't trust the whole move to HTTPS that they're trying to force on the internet, without any public debate, oversight or recourse. This is exactly the kind of thing Google, a company, not an elected government, should not be doing. ",
