I don't keep track of these things. \"Senator McCain, America has been humiliated by your president and party. Enough. Time to stop this. Speak up for impeachment.\" BTW, this is also the most responses I've gotten on Twitter from trolls. Wondering how many of them are real people, and how many are imitation people, Russians dressing up as Americans. ",
