The church is gone, the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4114991,-122.106259,3a,75y,103.11h,75.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2GuEo7y3_hdPAoo7SG5wnw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656\">land</a> is probably now part of a Google sub-campus. It was kind of a slum of an office, but it worked, it got us to the next stage, a suite of offices on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4316662,-122.1039337,3a,75y,121.42h,79.47t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sFT4lOwTmFFeDlVPVk8u4tQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DFT4lOwTmFFeDlVPVk8u4tQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D97.83552%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656\">Elwell Court</a> in Palo Alto, near the golf course and airport. The problem with the first office was that the windows didn't open and I was a smoker and they let you smoke in offices back then, even if the windows didn't open. So we made sure that the Elwell Court office had windows that opened. It was our top feature request. Then, we kept growing, and the next office was a standalone <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4203375,-122.0956367,3a,75y,125.35h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skMKj9NTMi-wniFPnqIiMkw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DkMKj9NTMi-wniFPnqIiMkw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D131.76736%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656\">building</a> on Charleston Road in Mountain View. By then we had forgotten about the windows opening, and as soon as we moved in realized oh shit the windows don't open here. ",
