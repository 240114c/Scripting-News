    "text": "Robert Frank <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/business/tax-cuts-rich.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0\">writing</a> in the NYT says that a tax cut for the rich won't make anyone richer, because it's all relative. It's a bug to see your wealth as relative to other people's wealth. There comes a point, way before you're in the 1%, that more money can't buy you more than you already have that you can actually use. You can't use two bedrooms, or two cars. Owning a stadium with 50K seats does you no good because you can only sit in one. Having more money does not make you bigger. As Bill Gates said, wisely -- the hamburger is the same, no matter how much money you have. ",
