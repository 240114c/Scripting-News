    "text": "Thanks to: NakedJen for putting together the initial list of programs with help from her friends in Salt Lake City. To JY Stervinou for lots of coaching on SQL and tireless testing and feedback on the initial design and all through development. Also bad French humor. And Scott Hanson and Andrew Shell for testing help. It's so important to have people who care and pitch in as software is developed. Thank you all so much! :boom: ",
