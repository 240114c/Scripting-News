    "text": "I'm especially thankful this year for <i>women</i> friends, all of whom have #metoo stories. My family was organized around one, I developed as a human being, as a man, as the inverse image of sexual abuse. It's a long story, that I don't yet know how to tell. I am especially thankful for women friends who love me and tell me that they know I'm a good man, not because I needed to hear that, but because it helps me feel safe. I am afraid about where we're headed, and how our strings are being pulled, how men's voices are silenced in this huge debate about what it means to be a man, and where leadership will come from, and if it will be kind.
