    "text": "I'm working my way through <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Godless+tv+series&ia=web\">Godless</a>. It's nice, but so far, three episodes in, it's not as great as the reviews say. I'd say it's about 3/5th of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)\">Deadwood</a>, which came first, was more depraved, and more entertaining. That said I was just in the part of the country that it's about, southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. I think it was filmed there too. And this gives me a clear picture of what's next for \"BingeWorthy\", a diary, a place where I can take notes about programs as I work through them. ",
