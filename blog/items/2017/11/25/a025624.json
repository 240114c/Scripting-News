    "text": "I finished <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Godless+tv+series&ia=web\">Godless</a>, and I liked it. 3.5 out of 5. It started off something like Deadwood, but in the end it was more of a Disney show with a bit of Hallmark, not nearly as depraved as Deadwood, which was <i>truly</i> depraved. Not that I'm opposed to lovely stories and gorgeous western scenery.  I'm not sure whether I'll give it a 3 or a 4 on \"BingeWorthy\". I'll sleep on it. In the meantime I think Rectify, based on the superb rating it has gotten from <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/hotlist.html\">BW users</a>, will be the next program I try. It's on Netflix. And it should be noted that this is my first binge in the BingeWorthy era. As with \"podcatch.com\", one of the reasons I do these projects is to keep me better informed and entertained. ",
