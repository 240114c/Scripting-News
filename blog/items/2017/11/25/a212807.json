    "text": "Checked on the BingeWorthy <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/hotlist.html\">hotlist</a>. Interesting to see Rectify at #3, but only with the minumum 5 votes to make it on the list. Freaks and Geeks which I had never even heard of, is in the top 10. It has 35 votes, which is more significant than 5. The really low-rated shows no longer get on the hotlist. Maybe I should increase it to the top 250, or increase the minimum number of votes to 10? Thinking about what's next. Have to figure out how we'll add new programs. I have some ideas. ",
