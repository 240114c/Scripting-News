    "text": "I'd like to try <i>What The Fox,</i> a fictional web browser that reverses all the strategies of Mozilla, Google and the EFF. For example, instead of complaining about HTTP sites, it would complain about HTTPS sites as being a silly waste of resources. Instead of making it virtually impossible to see the source of an RSS feed, it would make everything but RSS feeds virtually impossible to see the source of. Or maybe it would show the source of everything by default, and make it virtually impossible to see the rendered HTML. That might impact the usefulness of the web however, so should possibly be reconsidered.",
