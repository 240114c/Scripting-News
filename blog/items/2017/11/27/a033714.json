    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Frank\">Barney Frank</a> was on Lawrence O'Donnell's <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word\">show</a> this evening, explaining what Trump is up to in financial regulation in a clear way that you never hear on cable news. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_O%27Donnell\">O'Donnell</a> interrupted when he was just about to nail it. He kept talking and was almost going to pull it all together when O'Donnell interrupted again and said \"We have to leave it there.\" What was so urgent? A complete rehash of the Access Hollywood <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_and_Billy_Bush_recording\">thing</a>. So frustrating. <i>Would someone please get Barney Frank on a podcast and let him talk for an hour. </i>He has something to say that no one else is saying.",
