I think about him whenever I end one of my posts with two very cool emoji that work well together. A rocket :rocket: followed by a boom :boom:. This was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketboom\">name</a> of his videoblog, a pioneering effort, it was pretty famous in the early days of YouTube. It's so cool that those are the names of two emoji and they go so well together. :rocket: :boom:",
