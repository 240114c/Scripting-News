    "text": "Based on ratings on \"BingeWorthy\" I started watching <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/?id=00233\">Rectify</a>. It's the story of a man who is released from death row into a small Georgia town, and all the shit that happens. I liked the first season, but now I'm getting into the middle of the second, and it's more <i>cringe </i>worthy than binge worthy. What gives? Does it get better?? Also it's got one of the worst names ever. I figured by now I might know what it means, but noooo.",
