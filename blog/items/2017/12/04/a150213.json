    "text": "I stopped going to tech conferences when I realized there was no way to win as a voice in the \"audience.\" Then I started a <a href=\"http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html\">conference</a> that didn't have the concept of an audience. Our goal was to draw the crowd in the hallway back into the conference room. It worked. People loved BloggerCon. I saw some of this at Newsgeist in November. The quality of the session depends on how committed the discussion leader is to hearing from everyone, and following through on interesting and different ideas. I found that teachers and reporters often made excellent discussion leaders. A conference about news <i>should</i> be great. If the reporters are committed to getting the story. But reporters sometimes have a narrow field of vision. And teachers sometimes aren't interested in dialog with students.",
