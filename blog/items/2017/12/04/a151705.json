Larry Ellison and Scott McNeally said they will crush us, in different ways. Ellison more honestly. McNealy with cute metaphors. They were both full of shit. But people in the room might not have realized that. \"The future's not ours to see,\" one might have said to Larry and Scott. Even if you're worth a hundred million billion. ",
