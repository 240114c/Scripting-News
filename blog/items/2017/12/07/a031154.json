    "text": "<a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/50\">Braintrust query</a>: I'm looking for a good website with ski area weather forecasts for the Rockies. Lots of sites have conditions at the ski areas. I want to know where the weather is. Mainly just a question of the storm track and what's coming. I suppose I could look at weather forecasts for each ski area, but that's pretty labor intensive. What I want is the overview. Any suggestions?",
