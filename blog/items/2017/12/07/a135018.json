They may believe the women, always, 100 percent, but the world isn't that simple. Remember all the fake trolls who threw the 2016 election and the aftermath we're dealing with now. Let the dust settle. Develop a process for dealing with this kind of situation, so next time there won't be a precedent of the man just leaving in disgrace. Franken may be guilty, or not. We have principles in this country to uphold. Just walking away makes it that much more of a problem for the next man who is accused. Don't make a clich√© out of <i>the presumption of innocence. </i>It's an important <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence\">principle</a>. The Democratic senators have said their piece. Now let's have a process, and let's examine the facts. ",
