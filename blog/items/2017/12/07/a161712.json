    "text": "Jonathan Chait <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/the-steele-dossier-on-trump-is-looking-more-and-more-real.html\">points out</a> that the press has never considered the claims of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier\">Steele dossier</a> credible. I have the opposite take. I think they're obviously true, are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\">simplest</a> explanation of Trump's behavior. Trump goes to Moscow, flattered and bribed, gets in bed with Russians, it fits his lifestyle. I don't see why people don't believe it. ",
