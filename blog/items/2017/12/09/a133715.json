    "text": "Rectify is a <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/?id=00233\">favorite</a> of the BingeWorthy crowd, although with not a lot of votes, so I gave it a try. I watched two seasons. It had some good moments. And the premise is fascinating. A man on death row is given a reprieve and sent back to the town where he supposedly committed his crime. But the show drags on and on. It's a soap opera. Lots of meetings between characters where they sigh and struggle, in soap operaish ways. I guess most shows are just that, even The Wire or The Sopranos. But they have variety and surprises and humor. I'm not sure what makes a great binge, but for me, Rectify is not it. ",
