Franken could have, guilty or innocent, helped establish a process for a #metoo case, at least for politicians. The process is going to be different in private corporations. But the senators that forced Franken out had no authority to do so. He isn't anyone's employee. He represents the people of Minnesota, and as was pointed out in the New Yorker piece, they were not consulted. ",

I added that I didn't see what the rush was. A thorough and deliberative process would say that we're trying to be fair. A rush to judgment is exactly the kind of thing the Democratic Party was against, as far as I know. It's against the basic values of our country. If we want to maintain the rule of law (we do!) how does it help to circumvent it? I think it's great that a reporter thinks the facts are more important than an insider's view of optics, which is what the other panelists focused on. ",
