    "text": "Reporters and pundits seem to think we're reliving Watergate. I don't think so. In Watergate you didn't have ex-presidents warning that if we don't do something, we're going to wind up in Nazi Germany. I wonder how many times we'll hear that warning, or if you only get it once, and if the next thing is that the ex-president goes into hiding. How much are the Repubs in Congress backing Trump because they like the politics or they fear for their lives? There probably won't be a point where you get a choice, go this way for salvation and the other way for hell. It may be that by the time you realize there was a choice, there no longer is a choice. A year ago we were trying to convince electors to do the sane thing and not vote for Trump. Now look where we are. If Roy Moore makes it into Congress, how many Roy Moores will follow? ",
