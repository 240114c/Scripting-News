    "text": "I expect to have BingeWorthy for Movies ready to go tomorrow. It's the same codebase as the <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/\">TV version</a>, but there are differences. I only include movies currently playing in theaters, and new movies on the streaming services. So if a movie opens on Dec 25, it's not in the initial database, but will be there as soon as it's in theaters. I don't know if movies will age-out of the list. We'll see how it goes. I'm using Google for search because they include showtimes in their listing and DuckDuckGo does not. Utility wins out. No strategy tax. And there are a bunch of tweaks and little improvements of course. :rocket:",
