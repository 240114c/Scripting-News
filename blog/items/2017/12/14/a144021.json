    "text": "I've wanted what <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/movies/\">BingeWorthy for Movies</a> does for a long time, and especially for this time of year, when the Oscar-worthy movies come out, all at once, in December, with a final flourish with the ones the studios think are best on Christmas Day. Each year we have what's called the <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=NakedJen+Film+Festival&t=hg&ia=images\">NakedJen Film Festival</a>, to see how many movies we can watch on the big day. This idea was of course originated by NakedJen, in Santa Cruz, many years ago. I am a relatively recent convert. So we have to know which ones are the best. We've gone by very loose word of mouth, and reviewers' opinions. I always wanted to find a way to involve my blogging community. Hence BingeWorthy for Movies. :rocket:",
