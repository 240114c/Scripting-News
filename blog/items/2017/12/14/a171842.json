    "text": "I finished <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/12/the-crown-season-2-watch-the-real-historical-footage.html\">The Crown season 2</a> last night. Very nice. It's a little confusing as new characters are introduced without explanation. Feels like it's just getting started. So many characters to develop yet. And the Queen herself. Her majesty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Foy\">Claire Foy</a> is just amazing, and the queen's husband, played by Matt Smith, is revealed to be complex as well. I love this show. Almost ready to <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=00352\">give</a> it a 5. ",
