Maybe once a month it would be okay for emphasis, sort of like \"she reported the heck out of that\" meaning a sort of extreme reporting like scuba diving or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/world/asia/china-daredevil-skyscraper.html?_r=0\">rooftopping</a>. But when you always say it, it would seem to lose all meaning. Unless it means something that I just am not aware of. I wouldn't say anything if other people on MSNBC weren't starting to say it. They are.",
