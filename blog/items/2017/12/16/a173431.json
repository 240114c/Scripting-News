    "text": "The funniest thing happened. I realized that there are two episodes in the middle of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME2umFQ_xBA\">season 2</a> of The Crown that I hadn't seen. Some kind of glitch in the new Roku? Whatever, it's kind of embarassing, but actually cool. I hadn't seen the episode with the great Elizabeth <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ME2umFQ_xBA?t=1m45s\">line</a>. \"There is no possibility of my forgiving you. The question is how on earth can you can forgive yourself.\" The thing that alerted me was reading a story about the actress who played Jackie Kennedy. What? And the quote from her is amazing, I never would have forgotten it. So now I get to watch two great episodes I hadn't seen. No wonder in my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/12/14.html#a171842\">review</a> of the series I said \"It's a little confusing as new characters are introduced without explanation.\" That was actually a bug report, though I didn't know.",
