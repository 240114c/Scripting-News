Due to an operator error or software glitch, I had missed two full episodes in the middle of season 2. One of the episodes was worth noting, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/12/the-crown-recap-season-2-episode-8.html\">episode 8</a>, where Queen Elizabeth meets Jackie Kennedy. The episode stands alone, you can watch it without watching any of the others, and it really is extraordinary. ",
