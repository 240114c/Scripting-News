    "text": "New feature: <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=discuss\">The Discuss tab</a>. If you go there, you'll see a box with a Disqus thread. As I write this there's one comment, a test, that says \"Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends. We're so glad you could attend. Come inside come inside.\" There is a link to the <a href=\"http://guidelines.scripting.com/\">comment guidelines</a> at the top of the page, from previous discussion features on this blog. From time to time I will reset the thread, starting fresh. Between resets comments will accumulate. Not sure where this is going. In the past it has gotten to be too much work to moderate the comments. Maybe this is the time we find a happy equilibrium. :rocket:",
