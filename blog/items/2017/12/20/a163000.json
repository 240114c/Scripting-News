Openly corrupt. Self-dealing. Perhaps a few of them care what people think, a reflex, but on the whole they don't care because there's more to come. New election laws and executive orders. Starting in 2018. With controls on speech on the net, so we won't be able to tell each other what's happening. It's all pretty easy to do, if they have the will, and what we're finding out now is that they do. Still, so much dreaming about the rule of law still applying. We won't know if it does until we need it, really need it. I suspect it won't be there. ",
