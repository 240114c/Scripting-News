I have of course been thinking about my annual <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=rite\">rite</a>, choosing a person to honor as the standout BOTY. I do this almost every year, and there's still a couple of weeks left in 2017, so I might still do it this year, if inspiration hits me. But this has not, for me, been an inspiring year for blogging of others. So for now at least this will be a BOTY-less year. ",
