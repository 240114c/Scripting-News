Toward that end, I've been thinking about doing an app, for Mac at first, designed to make it easy to write publicly and link it to stuff on my blog. Of course, the only way to do that that makes sense is with an outliner. That's the tool for relative writing, and that's what community writing is all about. ",

But I would release the electron shell I use as open source (MIT license), so others could port it to Linux and Windows, and where ever else <a href=\"https://electronjs.org/\">Electron</a> gets us. Theoretically porting the shell is enough to pull it off. ",
