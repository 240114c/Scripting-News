On the other hand, women are pretty shitty to men too. I suppose it's simply that people are shitty to other people, and (possibly) gender matters only in how they express their shit? I don't think people have studied this objectively, so I think my own opinion is as good as anyone's.  ",

The exceptions among men are people who have had their armor removed by life. Having a serious illness or divorce, some kind of crisis that woke them up. And this may be true of women as well. If you haven't had to deal with a personal existential crisis, at some level you feel like life is infinite. People who have evaded death, for the moment, tend to be better friends. ",

I was still a boy. I'm sure girls go through something similar (though opposite perhaps) when their bodies mature when they are still children. ",
