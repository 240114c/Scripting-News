    "text": "It's disgusting the way Repubs attacked NY and Calif with their tax plan. An idea for a counter-attack: tax all income over $1 million at 100 percent, and accompany it with a statement. We will restore the tax to what it was when the Repubs undo their attack. That would get a conversation going between the rich folk who own the rest of us. What would NY/Calif do with the money? Pay its citizens to move to Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, etc. And vote. It wouldn't take many expat NYers to turn those states blue. I know it's a hardship, that's why they have to be paid, well, for their sacrifice. Like the bonus people get for giving up their seats on overbooked flights.",
