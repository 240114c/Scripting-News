    "text": "A small technical change in the way \"Scripting News\" is generated. There are two kinds of posts, singular items, and titled items. This post is a singular item. Both kinds appear on the home page and on the archive pages. But now titled items also appear on their own pages. For example, here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/12/29/160005.html\">titled item</a> from earlier today on its own page. And here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html\">archive page</a> for today. You may, in some RSS readers, see all the titled items from the month of December repeated, because their permalinks have changed. ",
