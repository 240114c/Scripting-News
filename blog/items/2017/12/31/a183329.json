    "text": "From a thread on Facebook. \"Boulder is great, but Denver can't be bad, it's Just that Boulder is relatively small, easy to grasp, like one of the towns on the peninsula in the Bay Area. I also like Santa Fe and Taos. Beautiful houses, low cost. Skiing right there. And New Hampshire and the Berkshires. I like places that have legal cannabis, says something about the voters even if you don't partake. But I couldn't live in Calif again, feels soulless to me. Not homey.\"",
