In that spirit, let me say as a JavaScript developer, who's been doing it pretty much every day for the last five years or so, I've mastered the <a href=\"http://callbackhell.com/\">callback</a> way of writing apps in JS. Now, in the latest version of the language, there are a number of alternatives to this.",

It works just like standards. Two ways of doing something is worse than one, no matter how much better the second way is. That's another way of stating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle\">Postel's Principle</a>. In this case, I already have so much code written using callbacks, and my brain works in callbacks (a bigger hurdle), and I <i>like</i> callbacks. The only reason to use one of the other forms of async programming is that other devs are using them to document their ideas. There goes the consensus. ",

The more agreement there is the more leverage we have, and the faster we can move. Remove consensus and we actually take steps backward, which is all too common in software. It makes it difficult to do multi-year or even multi-decade projects. (Not a dream, I have projects I've been working on for multiple decades.)",
