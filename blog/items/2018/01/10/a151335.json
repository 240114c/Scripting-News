    "text": "I saw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Billboards_Outside_Ebbing,_Missouri\">Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</a> yesterday. I really liked it. The best acting. A bunch of sad stories, told with humor. You know it has to be good cause Frances McDormand is in it. Like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Tonya\">I, Tonya</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Bird_(film)\">Lady Bird</a>, two other movies I've seen in the last few days, it's a story of a mother suffering for a daughter. All beautiful movies. The thing that makes a movie great, as always, is suspension of disbelief. If you get into the story, the movie is good. If you are still in the story the next day, it's great.",
