    "text": "An unusually long <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/occamAndWolff.m4a\">podcast</a> about Occam, Wolff, war, medicine, programming, debugging, hacking, Russia, war again, Pearl Harbor, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Watergate, Buzzfeed News, Ben Smith, the dossier, ladders, the elite, working together, and the day it hits us that this is not Watergate, will be another day like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016\">November 8, 2016</a>. The gatekeepers, the elite, don't want to give up their positions on the ladder, so ideas that threaten that can't get through. Instead we have to be <i>systematic</i> about letting ideas in.
