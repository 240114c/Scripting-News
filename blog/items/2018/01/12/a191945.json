    "text": "\"XML-RPC\" started in 1998, which means it's about to be 20 years old. I think this is the first <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html#5\">post</a> about it. Not very specific. We were already working on it, but we hadn't yet hooked up with the people at Microsoft. From a quick scan it looks like the actual protocol we standardized on didn't come out publicly until June. Pretty sure we had something working internally at UserLand in March or April.",
