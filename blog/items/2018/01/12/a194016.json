    "text": "It's really weird, the date on the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html\">piece</a> is wrong. It was December 27, not December 15. You can see that in the copy, it talks about being between Christmas and New Years. And mentions a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/23/newGlasses.html\">piece</a> that wasn't written until December 23. And I actually remember that this was on the 27th. Somehow, at some point, my CMS screwed this up. Which is weird because this is a static file. Looks like it was rebuilt some time in 2004. In any case if anyone wonders, the date is incorrect. ",
