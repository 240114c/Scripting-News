Copying a pointer and deleting an object can't be an atomic operation. it's still possible something will be added to a queue betw the two steps. And that would result in a lost item. ",

So I have proposed yet another approach in a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5/issues/14#issuecomment-357813407\">comment</a>. This one has the advantage of retaining the current simplicity and hding a bell/whistle that didn't need to be there in the first place. ",
