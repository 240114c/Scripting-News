    "text": "Just realized, the reason <a href=\"https://mcphee.com/products/librarian-action-figure\">librarians</a> must love the web, and linking, is that you can provide a complete bit of complex information without being overwhelming. It's the same reason I like coding in an outliner. There's no cost for being verbose, just tuck the verbosity under a headline and leave it collapsed. Until the day you wonder wtf is going on here. You can hide little crumb trails for later discovery. Links work the same way. ",
