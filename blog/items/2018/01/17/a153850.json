    "text": "I read this <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/15/aids-panic-trump-haitians-216324\">Politico piece</a> about this history of Trump and Haiti. Initially there was some bad data about a connection betw Haitians and AIDS that soon turned out to be false. But Trump kept bringing it up, and the stink on Haiti wouldn't go away. Reading this reminds me of the stink that tech put on RSS. There never was anything wrong about it, but people, some of whom even thought they were friends of mine, said some very ugly Trump-like things about RSS. (Actually even worse.) That's the sad thing about Trump, not just that he is such a flawed awful human being who is our president, but that if you live long enough, you've met plenty of other people who take those kinds of shortcuts just to hurt other people.
