    "text": "Much of what I read in #metoo writing paints men solely as women haters. That's all there is to say about us. Your father, brother, son, uncle, cousin, friends, we only exist to hate women. That of course is not true. I think what we all want, men and women, is to relax, to be loved, to feel safe, pleasure, acceptance, and secure for the moment. That's imho most of what we're looking for in love. No specific gender.",
