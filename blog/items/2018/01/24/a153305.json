    "text": "I went to Davos one year, in 2000. Didn't get invited back, but that was no surprise because the invite itself was a fluke. I wondered if I would go now if I were invited, and unless there were something specific I wanted to do with all those super rich people and their employees, and that seems pretty unlikely, I don't think I would go. It was worth going once. That's for sure. So I have a picture of all the things they talk about from there. And after a couple of days I unfollow all the people who live-tweet it. Enough with the star-fucking, ok.",
