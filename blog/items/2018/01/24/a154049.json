    "text": "I've now seen most of the Best Picture Oscar-nominated films. I haven't seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Out\">Get Out</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Thread\">Phantom Thread</a> yet. The only one I didn't like is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Post_(film)\">The Post</a>. I just saw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Florida_Project\">The Florida Project</a>. Beautiful movie. The kind of movie that I admire, even adore, for having a small plot but still holding my interest. The characters, the acting, the presentation are all so skillful and compelling that you fall into the movie and don't want to leave. Suspension of disbelief. Story-telling. I saw someone ask why you people like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape_of_Water_(film)\">The Shape of Water</a> (they didn't, I did). I answer it with a question: Are you pulled into the story. If so, it's good. That's all there is to it. I can certainly see how one might not be pulled into the movie. That was the problem with The Post. It has all the best actors. It's shot perfectly. But none of it meant anything to me. I was waiting to be in the movie, and it never happened. ",
