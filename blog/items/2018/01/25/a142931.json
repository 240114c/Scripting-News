John Dvorak, a classic Internet troll, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMQv0j29WHA\">explains</a> how it works. That's Trump. He wants you to think he wants to be shown the light. That's why the Repubs say things like they want to protect the Dreamers, just so you'll argue with them and waste energy and time and attention on it. <i>Meanwhile they're giving themselves your money.</i> So if you help them distribute their BS, you're part of the problem. Don't be part of the problem. Give yourself a Trumpectomy today.",
