I love the way this is going. It's perfect. I haven't heard of <i>any</i> of the blogs. I suspect that's what's happening. Lots of pockets of bloggers here and there, not connected together because of the huge roar or Twitter and Facebook. It's like setting up a bunch of music venues on the shore of a raging river. ",
