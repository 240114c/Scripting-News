Pretty good chance that's where we're going in the USA. Let's get it out now, in the form of a book, before they've completely locked down the press, and get it out in print, so it survives after the rule of law is gone. We can do a lot at this point to help ourselves on the \"other side.\" Listen to Trump. He wants to control speech. He's probably figured out how to get there. 2017 was a year of learning for him. Now he understands what he's up against. ",
