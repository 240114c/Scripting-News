    "text": "We need a new kind of domain, perhaps a <i>Historic Domain, </i>like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retired_number\">retired number</a> for a sports team. Should there ever be another <a href=\"http://gawker.com/\">gawker.com</a>? I don't think so. The content that's there now should be there for the foreseeable future. I don't know what the criteria should be for preservation but Gawker is clearly a domain that should be around next year and the year after that.
