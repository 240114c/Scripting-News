Next time I move I'm going to buy a new TV based on their recommendation. I also love it because a few years ago if you told the NYT that they could support journalism by making money off the things they write about that you buy they would have said <i>Tut tut you don't understand our ethics would not permit it.</i> Now they <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/business/media/new-york-times-company-buys-the-wirecutter.html\">own Wirecutter</a>. Haha. It's a clear signal that creative thinking is all that stands in the way of news making a good living. (Wirecutter's business model is <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/\">affiliate links</a> to the products they recommend.)",
