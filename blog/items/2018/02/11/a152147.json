    "text": "Added a small feature to my CMS. Now story pages like <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/02/09/131842.html\">this one</a>, have the publication date and time at the top of the page, just above the title. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/11/storyPageTime.png\">Screen shot</a>. It's one of my pet peeves, that it's hard to tell when a story was published. The info was on my story pages, but it was in the footer, and it was the last time the page was built. Not good enough. Now you can tell when a story was written, and it's up front where it belongs. ",
