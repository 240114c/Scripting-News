    "text": "I'm going through stuff from my mom's house. For example, here's an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/15/eveLeonWeddingInvitation.png\">invitation</a> to my parents' wedding on Christmas Day 1953 at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Lane_Hotel_(Manhattan)\">Park Lane Hotel</a> in NYC. Interestingly it's not far from where I live today. Of course I wasn't even a twinkle in my father's eye at the time (I was born in 1955). By posting it here I hope to be able to find it in the future. BTW, my grandfather's name is listed on the invite as \"Rubin\" but no one called him that. He was Rudy and was the superstar celebrity of the family. My grandmother, Lucy, was the real power. I bought a domain to commemorate him, appropriately named <a href=\"http://rudykiesler.com/\">rudykiesler.com</a>. ",
