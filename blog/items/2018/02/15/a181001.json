    "text": "A <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/15/thinkTankAd1985.png\">ThinkTank ad</a> that ran full page in PC Week some time in 1985. There's no date on the ad, or on the article on the other side of the page. The ad looks a lot better than the scan. And the fine print didn't make it on the scan, so I did another <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/15/fineprint.png\">scan</a> with just that info. My signature, in 1985, had a lot of detail that's since been lost. Back then I did a lot more writing, so my handwriting was more important than it is now, where all my writing is done on a keyboard, and has been for decades. Also years of being a CEO and having to sign stacks of things did a number on my signature too. ",
