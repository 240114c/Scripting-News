And won't sell guns to people under 21. This is a huge deal. We need more like this. But -- trying to get <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/roku-keeps-nratv-despite-pressure-to-drop-channel-we-dont-censor-based-on-viewpoint/\">Roku</a> to drop NRA TV, that's not only not useful, it's very very very bad. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\">First Amendment</a> is super important, as is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\">The Golden Rule</a>. Speech is a good thing, even if you detest what they're saying. And discounts to NRA members? Please that's harmless. NRA members are not the problem. Go to the source. Picket gun stores until they follow DSG's lead. <i>That</i> will save lives. Measure success for now as stopping sales of new weapons of war. ",
