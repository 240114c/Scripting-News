You know, that is exactly how Brendan Eich’s <a href=\"https://brave.com/\">Brave</a> browser is implemented.  I highly recommend it as an alternative to Chrome.",

For example, all of their ad blocking and tracking protection (they call these shields)  mechanisms are  easily user enabled or disabled globally or  on a per site basis."

It’s the sort of user control that I think they would be on-board with once they fully understood the user perspective.  (On the other hand they are immersed  in the Bay Area's HTTPS-should-be-used-everywhere culture so they might not immediately get it.)",
