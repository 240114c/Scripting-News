Too dark, too slow, not enough story, odd sad ending. Meh. But then for some reason I watched it again, and had the opposite reaction. A masterpiece. The pace was just right, and there totally was a story. It was just so slow, your mind has to get in the right gear to appreciate it. It's not an easy movie to like. But who said movies have to be easy?",

But it builds and a story emerges, and the music and the acting are superb, the story is fascinating. It's the kind of movie to watch again, alone, like you read a book, to savor every moment. ",
