    "text": "Sometimes the Academy passes on a movie that goes on to have great significance. For me, the most interesting example is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/awards\">The Big Lebowski</a>. It didn't win a single <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71st_Academy_Awards#Awards\">Oscar</a>. I wonder what the judges must have thought of it. A silly insignificant comedy? It's weird because TBL came after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69th_Academy_Awards#Awards\">Fargo</a>, which was much-celebrated by the Oscars. The year Lebowski would have been up for an award, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_Love\">Shakespeare in Love</a> won best picture, and imho the other winners were also Big Mehs. Imho there's no doubt The Big Lebowski was the Best Picture in 1999. But you don't necessarily know it in the moment. History has a role to play too. ",
