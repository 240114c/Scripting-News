    "text": "Approx 20-minute <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/03/06/podcastingAsJuggernaut.m4a\">podcast</a> about podcasting as a juggernaut. Why is it a juggernaut? You don't have to get permission to start a podcast, you can follow an idea intuitively, creatively. I offer two examples, the <a href=\"http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/\">Internet History Podcast</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/heresthething\">Here's the Thing</a>. Two podcasts that are not like what you hear in the excellent field of podcasts that sprang from <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/\">This American Life</a>. And that's just a tiny corner of what's out there. It's huge and diverse. No one gets the whole thing. Podcasting will continue to evolve as long as it's not controlled. ",
