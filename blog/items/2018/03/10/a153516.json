Because ISPs invisibly redirect download requests of popular programs to new versions with spyware added. Better: don't download an app that runs on your local computer from a site that isn't being served via HTTPS. But it doesn't follow that <i>sites that don't offer downloads</i> should be blocked. It's like saying drunk driving is dangerous and therefore all driving should be banned. Let's not break the web if we don't have to. ",
