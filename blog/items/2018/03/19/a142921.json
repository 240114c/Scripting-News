I skied there about 30 years ago with my young daughter. We had a great time. In a good year, they still get enough snow that you can ski there. I think the only ski areas  for sale these days are the ones that arenâ€™t really worth anything anymore.(At least as ski areas). Anyway, thanks for that Guardian article, what a send up. That was great!\"",
