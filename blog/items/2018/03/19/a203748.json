    "text": "I like public transit. I don't use cars much. I identify with the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-uber/woman-dies-in-arizona-after-being-hit-by-uber-self-driving-suv-idUSKBN1GV296\">pedestrian</a> who was killed in Tempe. I often cross streets outside crosswalks. I ride bikes in the city. I depend on interaction with drivers to stay safe. No one asked me if I want self-driving cars. If they did I'd say no. Let's invest in mass transit, and concentrate people, so we have a chance at saving our species. More reliance on cars is the wrong way to go. ",
