    "text": "Today's <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/03/22/505335.html\">Daily podcast</a> was a disaster. They interviewed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg\">Zuck</a>. And they have no idea of the context that Facebook exists in, as far as they knew they FB has no competition (there is Google of course), there is no open web, and it probably never crossed their mind that <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22lock-in%22&t=hy&ia=web\">lock-in</a> might be a problem. It's <i>always</i> the problem in tech. Poor Zuck, never thought he would have to deal with these problems. They actually have sympathy for him! It's still the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&source=hp&ei=zhy0WrqnJama_Qbr8oTwCg&q=baby+squirrels&oq=baby+squirrels&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1j0l9.1639.4841.0.5001.16.12.0.3.3.0.97.848.11.12.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.15.944.6..46j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i46k1j0i20i263k1.86.NS3xzrSRuCk\">baby squirrels</a> thing. There's an easy way out Mark. Set everyone free. Let people use Facebook not because it's the only choice, but rather because it's the best. Eventually his monopoly will break, and it will be a shock to him and the economy. We might come to think of Facebook as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail\">too big to fail</a>. Which btw, might have been a fair question to ask him too. I love the Daily, but this is the problem, when they finally get to a subject you know well, we find out what we always find out. They aren't doing a good job of representing the rest of us. ",
