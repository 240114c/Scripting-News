We all have to send messages of sympathy from time to time. I often find it awkward. Do I say I know what they're going through? In some sense I think I do, but I'm sure I don't, and would it be comforting? I don't think so.",

There are silver linings. New freedom. And expressing sadness is just sad, it's not tough. It's the easiest thing in the world. And is \"going through\" the right term? That assumes there's an end. There isn't always an end. And at the outset it doesn't at all feel like there is. ",
