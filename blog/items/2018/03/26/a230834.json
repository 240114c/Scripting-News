My brother <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/03/26/backupFrom1979.png\">just found it</a>. 8-inch floppies, formatted in UCSD-Pascal on top of CP-M. How the hell we're going to read the disks is a good question, but this is lost software. I definitely want to read it. Who knows it might even run. ;-)",
