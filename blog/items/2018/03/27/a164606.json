The new OPML file is fairly useless until feed reader apps add the ability to subscribe to an OPML file. Right now very few have this feature. But if even just a few of them do support the feature, all of a sudden we have a bootstrap. And a new way to share flows of news on the web. This was always part of the vision of RSS. Let's see if we can make this happen now in 2018. In a very real sense, we all can be part of history, if it works. :boom:",
