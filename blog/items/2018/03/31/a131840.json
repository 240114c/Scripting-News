I'm going very slow with the changes. This is a long-term project, it's important to get it right. Very different from the first time around with \"RSS\" apps when everything was a rush. Also want to take a look at display on phones and tablets. If you have any problems you'd like to report, here's a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedBase/issues/25\">fresh thread</a> to post in.",
