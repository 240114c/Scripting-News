    "text": "I need a MySQL mentor or two. While I was working on BingeWorthy and early versions of feedBase, I had two really good mentors, JY Stervinou and Scott Hanson. I don't want to lean just on them, so I'm putting out a call for a few people with MySQL experience so I can ask questions, and get answers based on experience. Saves a lot of time, and it will make feedBase more robust. With that in mind I have a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/73\">basic question</a> today, posted here. Thanks in advance! :boom:",
