Now we sort by name but include the subscriber count. An <a href=\"http://feedbase.io/?username=davewiner\">example</a>. I think this is the more rational approach. It's useful to see the subscriber counts. Note that the counts are not the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/04/02.html#a191743\">combined</a> counts, so you'll only see the counts for the specific feed URL you're subscribed to, not the combination of all the aliases.",
