    "text": "I generally don't like to look at how mailbox-type readers render this site. The best I've seen are ones that ignore titleless posts. At least they don't show the reader a mangled version of my writing. Then there's the ones that repeat the body of titleless posts in the title. So you see my writing twice, as if I had a stutter. It's not my stutter, the text only appears once in my feed. Readers that get on board with titleless posts are helping to open the door for new kinds of blogging. I've chosen to ignore their ignoring and just plow ahead. BTW, when I say \"new way\" I really mean \"old way.\" My blog, the original one, esp for RSS support, had titleless posts years before RSS existed. And the format allows titleless posts. So those that don't support them can't really claim to support \"RSS\". ",
