    "text": "I hate possessions. With my mom dying earlier this year, the house I grew up in will soon be out of the family. All this stuff, if we threw it out, would be gone forever. It was nice that she was keeping it all. Then I think of all the possessions I've taken from that house in the past. Where are they now? Not anywhere I can put my hands on them. I have shed all my possessions several times in my life. Yet I keep accumulating them. This year I got far more than I ever wanted. What will become of them? I really can't be trusted with things. ;-)",
