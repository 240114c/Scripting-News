Based on his report, I decided to get the new iPad and the pencil. I used to be a diagram person, as part of pitching ideas to other people, I'd develop what I called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk_talk\">chalk talk</a>. A very good way to communicate, highly personal and persuasive. ",

So unless I get into a daily routine with it, I find it is usually dead in the moment of inspiration-driven need.",
