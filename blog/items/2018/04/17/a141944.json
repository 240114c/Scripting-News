I think this is necessary, but this should be created and managed independent of the tech industry. News already looks to tech to be its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#Slang_terms\">sugar daddy</a> which leads to fawning coverage, and a huge conflict, at a time when tech is more in the news than ever, and deserving of scrutiny. Tech controlling news flow, especially Apple, which has little respect for criticism, free speech, spells the end of any semblance of independence of news. Also I'm hearing more that paywalls are seriously stifling the flow of news, at a time when we need <i>better</i> flow. Apple would not be good for that either. ",
