    "text": "A friend who uses Feedly told me about his collection of NYT feeds. He sent a pointer, where Feedly offered me a chance to use his list. <i>But only on Feedly. </i>Ugh. Ideally, they would let me have the list in OPML form. I suspect they do, but if so, it's not obvious esp to someone who would want the list in OPML, i.e. someone who is not a frequent Feedly user, such as yours truly. This is the problem with commercial vendors who build on open formats. They don't reciprocate. They consume the openness. This <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/468991-all-of-this-has-happened-before-and-it-will-all\">happened</a> before. Even better if they offered a dynamic link to the user's collection, so I could add the link to the OPML to my reader and if his collection changed I'd be updated. Remember the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3\">big idea</a> of the web, <i>people return to places that send them away. </i>Feedly is doing the opposite, trying to suck people in and hold them. This is the tech industry philosophy, and it will imho be its downfall.",
