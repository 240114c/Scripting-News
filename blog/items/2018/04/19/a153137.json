    "text": "Anyway not only is blogging not xxx, but look at all the new features here on \"Scripting News\". Many of these things have never been done in blogs before, or for that matter on news org sites. You only believe it's xxx if you <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=ignore\">ignore</a> everything outside your little piece of the blogging world (which for many is limited to their own blog). Just as we need to branch out and share innnovations in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/04/18.html#a214730\">land of RSS</a>, we must do that for blogging too, so that when people say it's xxx, we can <i>show them</i> how it's anything but. You want blogging to thrive? It can, if you're willing to look, and tell the story.",
