You know all those citations at the end of every Wikipedia article? Where do you think those come from? Wikimedia owes the internet an apology. And New York mag, I used to respect it, has been running a series with the theme that the internet wants to apologize. That's like saying the Grand Canyon wants to apologize. This is what journalism thinks it can get away with. No different than the garbage Fox News sells. ",
