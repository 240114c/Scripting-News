    "text": "I finished all sixteen episodes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_Berlin\">Bablylon Berlin</a>. It was quite a ride. And at the end I'm not sure exactly what happened. I needed this <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/babylon-berlin-netflix-how-it-ends.html\">summary</a> to convince me that I did/do. Would I recommend it? It's a roller coaster. Dark. Some scenes are hard to watch. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30PPdLTLlko\">song</a> is addictive. You fall in love with the characters.  Would I watch it again? Not sure. But the ending isn't exactly Singin' in the Rain. ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º",
