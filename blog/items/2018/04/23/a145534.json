    "text": "I got a confusing <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/04/23/smugMugEmail.png\">email</a> this morning from Flickr, saying I'd have to migrate <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews\">my site</a> to SmugMug by May 25, or download and delete my site. Then I read their <a href=\"https://blog.flickr.net/2018/04/20/together-smugmug-flickr-faq/\">FAQ</a> that said I would only be agreeing to new terms and privacy policy. In 2014 I wrote a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/08/03/theEphemeralityOfWhatWeCreateOnline.html\">post</a> saying someday Flickr will die. Today is not that day, but it certainly raises the question again. I don't know much about SmugMug. Not the greatest name ever. Might want to just call it Flickr, a better-known name that has been on shaky ground for a long time. Saying it's part of SmugMug now probably doesn't do much to add confidence. Just sayin. ",
