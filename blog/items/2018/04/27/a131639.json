This has nothing to do with wrong or right, it has to do with people's feelings. I think this kind of change is a good thing. If you ask most people they would probably agree. But the ballot is a private thing. You can vote on what makes you comfortable or against what makes you uncomfortable. People said they were voting for change, but in fact they were voting for the opposite. A return to normalcy. And what's more normal than a white male president?",

Queasy is the opposite of comfort. ",

Trump sure is white and male, and not in a good way, imho (speaking as a white male myself).",

The smart move is to find a white male Democrat who won't sell us out to the Kochs and Mercers. Yes a white male in the time of #metoo. You may not feel this is the person you <i>want</i> as president, but it is someone you can accept, as a compromise. You say you're tired of compromise? Well, when you're unwilling to compromise you get Trump. And if we aren't smart we'll get another four years of Trump in 2020. ",
