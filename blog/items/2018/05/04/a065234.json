    "text": "My <a href=\"http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=188139452\">mom</a> was a quilter, so I inherited a bunch of her quilts ones she made over many decades. There is a philosophy to quilting, which I observe as an outsider. The work is done very much with the idea of creating a legacy. I have a friend, Sheila, in Seattle who is a quilter. I wanted her to have one of Eve's quilts, even though they had never met. I thought of this because she posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10216286318295172&set=a.1604799764457.241313.1370027423&type=3&theater\">picture</a> of her latest quilt on Faceboo. We hooked up in Seattle this week, talked about parents, and of course quilting. I don't know much about quilting, but I find it fascinating. Anyway, I just rolled over the archive for this blog, saving an <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2018/04.opml\">OPML file</a> of the writing I did in April, along with all the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml\">other months</a>. In a way my blog archive is like mom's quilt collection. A hope to pass something into the future saying <i>this is who I was.</i>",
