    "text": "In hindsight, I realize we should have done a video walkthrough of mom's house as it was when she left us. Exactly as it was. Now it is staged for sale, all the personal stuff is out. It's a house transitioning to be a new family's house. It was <i>our</i> family house for over 50 years. I didn't think of it because at the time, the way the house was set up was <i>the most normal thing. </i>I never thought that it was an archive of lives that were now over, that it was about to disappear. I mention this so if you end up being the one to close up shop on a family house, take a good video snapshot before you start taking it apart. ",
