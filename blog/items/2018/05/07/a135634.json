One more year before I get to sing the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PlCXLZHbuA\">Beatles song</a>. I don't believe in celebrating birthdays on the net. I know other people like it. No judgment. I had to edit my <a href=\"http://davewiner.com/\">personal page</a> just now, so I thought I should mention it here. ",
