    "text": "The NYT Daily podcast is spawning a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/business/media/new-york-times-daily-podcast-tv.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\">weekly show</a> on FX. It will not be hosted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikiebarb\">Michael Barbaro.</a> I think this is a mistake. The thing that makes the Daily good is not that they're NYT reporters, though that is of course important, it's that Barbaro is an inquisitive and empathetic interviewer. There are lots of NYT reporters, but I've never seen an interviewer so capable of bringing out an unusual point of view as Barbaro. ",
