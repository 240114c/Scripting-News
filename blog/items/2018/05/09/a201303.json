I guess because they can't prove that Trump is owned by Russia they can't consider that his actions have to be viewed in those terms. If they could, then the explanation is clear. Trump is trying to dismantle American influence in the Middle East and create a vacuum for Russia to move into. This is the Occam's Razor answer.",
