    "text": "The problem with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/sports/warriors-rockets-finals-west.html\">juggernauts</a> like the Golden State Warriors is that they become boring. It's the same act as last year. They're bored, and I can tell I will be bored too, soon. And next year? Not again, please. This happened with the Miami Heat. Once you win three championships in say five years, the team should be required to reset. Otherwise the NBA itself is doomed to be boring.",
