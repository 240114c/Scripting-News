I <i>reallllly</i> appreciate this, even though their story text is already quite readable. I decided to add it to my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html\">story pages</a> and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/05/19.html\">day archive</a> pages. A nice little addition. Doesn't clutter things up, and its purpose is fairly obvious, I hope. :boom:",
