    "text": "Sometimes the advocates are aware that there is an installed base. They give it a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system\">disparaging name</a> that makes it seem okay to ignore it. Or they say that the new protocol will be so much better that any sane person will want to switch right away (and who cares about insane people). Or the new protocol is so compelling the installed base will swamp the base of the old klunky one. What happens is the new way is over-done and too complex and gets very slow adoption even from new applications. And if the proponent is a bigco, like Apple or Google, the market ends up with a hairball. Too many hairballs and the market fades away. Never actually disappears, but people lose interest. (This is what happened with SOAP and all the WS-xxx protocols.)",
