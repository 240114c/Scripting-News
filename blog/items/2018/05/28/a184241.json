It doesn’t seem controversial to me. Blogs are where sources write. Same reason journalists cite blogs (and tweets). The record is where it is. For example, I’ve spent the last week rebuilding XML-RPC in JavaScript. The original work was done in 1998, and the process was started with a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html\">blog post</a>. That post is very much part of the record. Conclusion -- as with journalism, it's a case of apples and oranges. I've never written an academic paper, and don't expect to. But if you were doing research on networking protocols, the source material for at least some of your work, would be on blogs. Which of course, makes it clear why we should be doing more to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=future-safe+archives+site%3Ascripting.com&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=future-safe+archives+site%3Ascripting.com&aqs=chrome..69i57.6911j0j3&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">preserve</a> the record.
