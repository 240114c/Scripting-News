I'm willing to cut her all kinds of slack for a first episode because I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/05/06/132007.html\">like</a> the way she thinks and I find her comedy funny. But she <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/05/06/132007.html#a132228\">knows</a> she's doing it, and still does it, and that's not cool.",
