    "text": "Idea for a cable news show. Every night they poll a random group of Americans with questions relating to the news of the day. A cross-section, not just liberals or conservatives, all regions, races, etc. They don't know that it's the show polling them. A real polling organization runs it. Pundits discuss what the people think. Last night they would have asked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1003700531569872897\">this question</a>. Do you think the president should be able to pardon him or herself? The choices would be: Yes but only Repubs, Yes but only Dems, Yes, No. ",
