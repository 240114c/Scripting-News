But there's a shock that comes when you realize that there are not two definitions for the term \"sell out.\" When you sell out someone else owns it.

I've seen people make a stand for the values of the acquired company, both in the company I sold and in other companies that were acquired. It never works. If you have a good stock program, keep your head down, let the stock vest, and then move on. Assume they are going to screw up your company. And if they don't you can be happy! :boom:",
