Stories posted and reposted from your ‘friends’ that are old posts from 4 days prior. You didn’t like it then, why would you like like it every day for 4 days. Cheap news stories and not from top tier news outlets - even though I constantly unlike and say that i don’t want to see these types of stories. All in all my feed has gotten littered and uninteresting and I have to purposely go to friends timelines to see what they’re doing. I’m really upset about it, as are so many people I know.",
