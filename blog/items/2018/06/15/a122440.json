    "text": "I watched the whole of the first season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_(TV_series)\">Barry</a>, an HBO series starring Bill Hader. It's billed as a comedy, I guess, but it's not casual. No spoiler to say that Barry is a hitman, you find out in the very first scene. But it is a bit profound, and lots of plot twists, and about as excellent as you would expect given the brilliance of Hader.  ",
