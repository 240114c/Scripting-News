    "text": "Most of the reviews you read for bingeable TV shows are of the first few episodes because that's all the networks provide reviewers at the beginning of a season. The exceptions of course are Netflix and Amazon. I just finished Season 3 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot\">Mr Robot</a>, and having seen all ten episodes I have to say you would have had no idea what was coming and how good it would get based on the first few episodes. This was the season when Elliot and his sister Darlene become human. Find love. Accept their own flaws and their father's, the titular character. There's one scene in episode 6 when father and son are fighting in a totally <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/21/mrRobotFightingWIthElliot.png\">Mr Robot way</a>, and I laughed so hard, it was <i>so</i> well done. \"I guess he didn't like my note,\" says Elliot. Episode 8 with the young Iranian kid was so sweet, and it's when we learn Elliot cares about people and loves himself. This is new. Anyway, Season 2 was a disappointment, but Season 3 makes up for it. I may have to watch it again. ",
