Most of this email is threatening, blackmail. Very little about any benefit. Also <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">scripting.com</a> is my oldest site. The blog that started blogging. Older than Google itself. I am livid mad with this company that we used to love, that was born of the web. If you're not up on what they're doing, I wrote a <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">FAQ</a> for you. Please read and pass it along. The press isn't covering this for some reason. ",
