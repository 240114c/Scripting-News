    "text": "BTW, there was an ominous sign, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/twitter-smytes-customers/\">news this morning</a> that when Twitter acquired a company their APIs went off the air with 1/2 hour warning, knocking some very important infrastructure off the air. I think maybe it's time for a conference among tech leaders, a quiet one, to discuss what the big companies are trying to do to the web, and maybe this is all unintentional. I'm really tired. It could be the jetlag from my European trip, or it could be that I'm getting weary of working so hard with so little reward, but I will not be updating my stuff. I'm going to let them knock my sites off. I've given a lot to the web, as much as I care to. ",
