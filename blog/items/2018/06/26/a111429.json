The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_ethiopiangold/status/1010577140595560448\">latest</a> calls the cops on an 8-year-old girl selling water in front of her house. Her name is Boo. (Update: She was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/26/permit-patty-san-francisco-police-black-girl-selling-water\">resign</a> from the cannabis business she founded.) But the most interesting of all is the original, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Huckabee_Sanders\">Sarah Huckabee Sanders</a>. In there beats the heart of a human being, I'm sure, but it's so well hidden by the venemous bile. Basically I have a thing for largeish authoritarian women who lie. ",
