Now if the <a href=\"http://pics.scripting.com/0129/0001.jpg\" title=\"My first flat-screen monitor.\">anchor</a> tag linking to the image has a title <a href=\"http://pics.scripting.com/0050/0006.jpg\" title=\"Dave Jacobs bought a hot new sports car, many years ago.\">attribute</a>, that is displayed in the lower left corner of the dialog. At first I thought it should be at the top, but that's not the role that <a href=\"http://scripting.com/static/412/Dscn1048.jpg\" title=\"Lunch w Tim O'Reilly when he got a call from Jeff Bezos.\">titles</a> play in anchors. It's a parenthetical comment. ",
