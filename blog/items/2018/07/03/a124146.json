    "text": "I asked a couple of questions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1014121937533046784\">on Twitter</a> about wordpress.com and Tumblr, two blog hosting sites that seem like they might allow authors freedom to move. What you want is the same freedom you get from an email service -- when its time to move, you can forward all requests to the new service. I've posted the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/86\">same questions</a> in the issues section of the repo for this blog. Turns out it isn't that simple, and while WordPress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmaiorana/status/1014123762441228288\">claims</a> to do it, at least <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thDigitalReader/status/1014125804148658176\">one</a> of their users says they don't. This is worth exploring. ",
