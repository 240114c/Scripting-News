    "text": "I love the NBA, and this is by far the best part of the season which is an interesting statement, because the NBA isn't playing basketball right now. They're playing power and money. The money is huge and the power is shifting. The Lakers get LeBron because of Magic, Kobe, Shaq, Kareem, Wilt, Jerry, Phil and Pat et al. And Golden State gets Cousins because  <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/2018/7/3/17529428/demarcus-cousins-signs-warriors-nba-free-agency-reactions\">they can</a>. So many interesting conversations to be had. I've heard it said that the East is now a backwater, but wait until a western star realizes they can play a completely different game in the East. Free agency isn't over yet for 2018. And I can't wait to see Philadelphia and Boston compete, and somehow hope the Knicks get into it, but so far, not.  ",
