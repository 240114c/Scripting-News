    "text": "I'm reading some of the pieces that have just come back online. For example this one -- <a href=\"http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/goodSoftwareDesignIsAgeless\">good software design is ageless</a>. It talks about removing features from software, and how that breaks users. I think I understood why that happens when I wrote the piece, but disclaimed it. It's because the people who do the breaking weren't the ones who fought for the users, who made the product successful. They don't have a feel for how much they had to do to get them to commit. We're having the same argument over and over, when a new generation comes of age and wants to throw out the accomplishments previous generations made. I don't know why software is particularly afflicted by this. I read an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/06/gateway-tunnel-new-york-city-infrastructure-218839\">article</a> today about a pair of 100-plus-year-old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_River_Tunnels\">tunnels</a> under the Hudson River, and now if they fail it will do severe damage to the country's economy. We have similar technology in software. But we wreck the tunnels, willfully, every generation. This is why progress is so elusive, and also imho why people don't trust tech.",
