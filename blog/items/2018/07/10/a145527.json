I found what appears to be the original copy, dated 12/2/2000. It's now <a href=\"http://this.how/states/states.opml\">accessible</a> through this.how, which is served by PagePark, using its built-in ability to render OPML files. I'm rebooting the <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+worldoutline&t=h_&ia=web\">worldoutline</a> capabilities but with an open source scalable stack. :rocket:",
