    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html\">One year ago today</a> I introduced a feature that allowed me to include a post from Scripting News within another post. Here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html#a033236\">example</a>, and the video <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html#a052616\">demo</a>. I wondered if I would use the feature. I haven't. But I forgot it was there, and forgot how it works. There's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/13/headlineTooBig.png\">CSS problem</a> that's shown up, when I increased the size of the titles on the story pages. I'll fix that now.",
