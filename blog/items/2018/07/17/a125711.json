    "text": "How to put this -- it's nice when a journalist or political figure correctly explains out how technology works. For example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1019082628341948422\">Noah Smith</a>, an opinion writer for Bloomberg, advises a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo/status/1018944985415249924\">columnist</a> for the Washington Post that muting on Twitter is not a good idea, that blocking works better. I saw his post because it was RT'd by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/de1ong\">Brad DeLong</a>, an economic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Bradford_DeLong\">historian</a> at UC-Berkeley. I chimed in -- \"You are right. They are trolling you, [and when you mute them] you just don't know it.\" And even if you block them, they can and do still go one-on-one with people who engage with you, and there are no tools on Twitter to stop that. But at least when you block them you keep them from broadcasting to everyone who follows you.  Bottom-line: Block trolls, don't mute.",
