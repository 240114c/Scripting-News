They've made it very clear that to the extent they have such things, they will have no influence on what they do. This piece is required reading, imho. And the business-as-usual approach of Bernie Sanders et al is unsupportable. <i>We need to close ranks.</i> Stop trying to optimize and just focus on getting the Repubs out of our government, asap.",
