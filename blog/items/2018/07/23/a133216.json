    "text": "Trump's latest tweet is no joke. It's a huge escalation. He blew through all the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON\">defcons</a>. The issue isn't whether or not to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1021334339399843840\">ban him</a> from Twitter rather, where does he go for a rush after this? I <a href=\"http://this.how/trolls/\">wrote</a> this about Trump as a troll in 2016: \"Immunity to outrage builds up over time. What pissed people off six months ago will barely show up as a blip today.\" You can already see that this tweet isn't getting people riled up as it might have a few months ago. They understand how his trolling works. This is a serious problem for him. Without the ability to escalate through tweeting, he might have to resort to flyovers and actual attacks.",
