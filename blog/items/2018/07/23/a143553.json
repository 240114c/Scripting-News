    "text": "Apparently tomorrow is the day Google will start flagging sites that use HTTP, the <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">standard web protocol</a>, as \"not secure.\" Curious to see how people react. BTW, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/chrome-warns-of-not-secure-sites-to-cut-web-surveillance-tampering-faq/\">this link</a> has auto-playing video. It may be \"secure\" but it's also obnoxious. This blog and all my other sites use HTTP. I don't see that changing. I expect this will make writing for the web more of a chore. That's life I guess. I don't want Google to be able to mold the web to its needs. I never signed on to being a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/06/13/142326.html\">Google developer</a>, and never would. Basic rule: Google is a guest on the web, as we all are, and guests don't make the rules. ",
