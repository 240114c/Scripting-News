    "text": "Good morning HTTP fans. I still haven't gotten the new version of Chrome here so I don't have to look at their defacement of my blog and other sites, yet. I read in the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/chrome-warns-of-not-secure-sites-to-cut-web-surveillance-tampering-faq/\">CNET story</a> (warning self-playing video) earlier in the week that Firefox isn't labeling HTTP-standard sites as <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Evil%20Incarnate\">evil incarnate</a>. Is this true? Is it something they are perhaps willing to commit to? If so, I will probably switch to Firefox. I have some other ideas, like moving off the web and providing my blog in an <a href=\"https://electronjs.org/\">Electron</a> app, far away from Google's ability to <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">push</a> me around (hah, Electron is built on Chrome, I wonder how independent it really is). Anyway, If anyone knows what Firefox's plan is, please post a note <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/88\">here</a>. Or any other browser that accepts the web as TBL defined it. Warning: I may have to delete the thread because posts like this tend to draw trolls. You know who you are. Restrain yourself! :boom:",
