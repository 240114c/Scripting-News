I was talking about Google Toolbar and a conversation I had with Marissa Mayer. I didn't remember the controversy, but was able to piece it together from listening to the <a href=\"http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cnMar1B.mp3\">podcast</a> and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2006/02/16.html#When:9:37:59AM\">reading</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/02.html\">old</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050225052941/http://www.thetwowayweb.com/2005/02/22\">blog</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/02/22.html\">posts</a>. It was a really evil thing. They changed links in HTML pages in Firefox (this predates Chrome) to point to Google's sites. It came pre-installed in Firefox. This was Google eleven years ago.

But I don't doubt for a minute the idea is to go all the way, to make the web as much Google's as Facebook's world is Facebook's (I know that sounds weird). ",
