I looked up all the places I've lived and they were all blue, except the street I grew up on in Queens. That was red. I thought about all my mom's neighbors and how they must have mostly been Trump voters. In a way I was glad she never found out. Some of the racist things I've heard them say now make sense. The neighborhood is turning, from white and Christian to Asian. I can't imagine they will vote for Trump, but wtf do I know. ",
