    "text": "Most journalists don't know anything about tech. They studied history in college. They write about Facebook without even being users of Facebook. Not only is there no one home in the Oval Office, but it's even worse in JournalismLand. Remember last time around they were conned into believing that running one's own email server was nefarious. They are novices. (BTW, history is important. Don't want to diminish that.)",
