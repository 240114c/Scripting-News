    "text": "When I moved to California from Madison in 1979, I put together a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf\">brochure</a>, in a manner of speaking, about the work I had been doing on an integrated outliner and database that I build into the UCSD P-System running on top of CP/M on a Cromemco machine. I called the product <a href=\"http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf\">HighFiles</a>, for high level file system. That's how I thought of it. We found a copy of this document in my mom's house back in February. Finally got around to scanning it. It's a time capsule. Some ideas I didn't think I had that early, and some absolute <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shaking%20my%20head\">SMH</a> things, which I'm now putting on the record. I was only 24 back in 1979. :boom:",
