    "text": "Idea for rebooting blogosphere #1. Create features for blogs that don't exist anywhere else. For example, I just pointed to a post written by <a href=\"https://davisshaver.com/\">Davis Shaver</a>. A nice database would note that, and create a link between his blog and mine. I could ask for a list of all the blogs that I've pointed to, and that would become my blogroll. ",
