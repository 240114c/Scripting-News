Sorry Google, your search engine is showing serious signs of age and boredom. We can do so much better. Here are the ideas.",

Topics, sub-topics, and lists of pages that those topics are discussed on. 99 percent of the searches I do on my own blog are really just navigations of this structure. Search engine technology is getting smart enough to recognize not just words but concepts. How about a service that sucked down all the content of my blog and created the back-of-book index of my writing. Realtime. Updated every time I post something new or modified an existing post. ",

I'm obviously referring to the scripting environment I developed and worked on for a couple of decades, and still to this day use every freaking day.
