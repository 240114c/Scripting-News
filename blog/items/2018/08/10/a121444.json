    "text": "I got an email in the middle of the night asking if I had seen an <a href=\"https://blogs.harvard.edu/blog/2018/07/13/upcoming-changes/\">announcement</a> from Berkman Center at Harvard that they will stop hosting blogs.harvard.edu. It's not clear what will happen to the archives. Let's have a discussion about this. That was the first academic blog hosting system anywhere. It was where we planned and reported on our Berkman Thursday meetups, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon\">BloggerCon</a>. It's where the first podcasts were hosted. When we tried to figure out what makes a weblog a weblog, that's where the <a href=\"http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html\">result</a> was posted. There's a lot of history there. I can understand turning off the creation of new posts, making the old blogs read-only, but as a university it seems to me that Harvard should have a strong interest in maintaining the archive, in case anyone in the future wants to study the role we played in starting up these (as it turns out) important human activities.
