    "text": "I just looked for some of the old 2003-2004 sites, and they're already gone. Earlier this year we <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/204408.html\">lost the handle</a> on <a href=\"http://radio-weblogs.com/\">Radio UserLand</a> weblogs because the <a href=\"http://www.weblogs.com/about.html\">new owner</a> of weblogs.com was unwilling to maintain a <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/\">DNS entry</a> pointing to them. That and Google's marking HTTP sites as <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">not secure</a> have been huge blows to the web as an archival medium. It's a good time to pause and reflect on the question of what was the value of all the work, and why bother continuing if the people who should care, a major university, a large research company and one of the largest tech companies, don't care about maintaining the web. What hope is there for it being maintained in the future?",
