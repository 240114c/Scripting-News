    "text": "We're a few weeks into the new Chrome way of labeling sites like \"Scripting News\" as \"not secure\". I haven't seen any notable changes among readers. The only people questioning the security of the site, that I know of, are the same ones who followed Google's lead without considering the negative consequences on the web as an archival medium. I took a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1027582827381096448\">poll</a> of my followers on Twitter and found that 68% of the Chrome users are seeing the \"not secure\" message. Here was a chance for some to express concerns, and there were none. My Chrome hasn't updated yet, apparently, so I don't see it here. I'm sure there are less draconian solutions for sites that are basically archives to Google's stated goal of assuring the content hasn't been meddled with in a MITM way while in transport. I have ideas, but so far I haven't seen much evidence of Google's interest. A bad sign for a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html\">platform</a> manager, btw. But it's par for the course for Silicon Valley tech companies. I've had this experience with all of them, Sun, Apple, Microsoft, even the company I founded, after I left. We're the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Znh0OM9jiA\">power</a>, you're nobody, why should we listen. It's a terrible way to govern an even worse way to manage a platform. ",
