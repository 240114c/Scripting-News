    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/14/toMathewIngram.m4a\">20-minute podcast</a>. I got involved in a discussion with Mathew Ingram, Om Malik and others on Twitter on what is going on with <a href=\"https://blog.joincivil.com/introducing-the-first-civil-council-members-and-looking-ahead-to-the-next-year-def988ae25a1\">Civil</a> and what's needed to get journalism the support of the people that it so totally needs. I want to tell the story of the W3C and the IETF and how the tech industry made it look like the tech was open without it being open. We need journalism, and we can't afford to wait for the experiments to prove not to be the answer. I outline emphatically what needs to happen now. Journalism needs to grow, without the limits that journalism has placed on itself. This is addressed to Mathew but it's really meant for everyone. I apologize in advance for using him as a foil. :boom: ",
