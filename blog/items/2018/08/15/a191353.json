For some reason a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=bike+speaker\">search</a> on Amazon yielded nothing but crap, but if you know what you're looking for you get some pretty nice stuff. Rex Hammock recommended <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Waterproof-Portable-Bluetooth-Black/dp/B01MSYQWNY\">JBL Flip</a>. And Jason Gilman recommended <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MXDNA2O/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_-L1CBbV67GDBM\">Clearon</a>. Roland Tanglao <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1029534796957933568\">said</a> he loves his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-Wireless-Bluetooth-Waterproof/dp/B01FFV59PY\">UE Roll 2</a>, and I have one of those, but it didn't occur to me it could be bike-mounted. The bungee that's built in works fine on a bike, and I took it for a spin just now and it's perfect. Great sound. Totally loud enough to be heard over NYC street noise, with great frequency range and thumpin base to keep the wheels turning. A really great answer. Davey's a happy cyclist. Thanks everyone for the great advice. I want to try all of these speakers. ",
