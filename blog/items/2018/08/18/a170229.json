    "text": "I'm in season 3 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)\">Deadwood</a> now. Very different experience from the first time through when I watched the episodes as they came out. One thing that's clear is that it's a comedy. And they sometimes had a blast in the writer's room, with puns and characters finishing each others' speeches. I know in advance some characters are doomed, which is disturbing. And I had forgotten how evil some characters are. Not Swearengen though. He's a poet and hippie. Has limited ambition. That isn't clear in the first season, but by the third he's matured, as has Bullock, to become peacemakers even civil rights advocates.",
