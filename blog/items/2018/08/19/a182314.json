    "text": "It would be great to have a daily website that summarizes what's on each of the MSNBC shows, so I don't have to watch them. Each segment on each show. Any new information or ideas makes it in. Omit recitals of previous optics. I don't care what pundits think. Same for each of the Sunday morning shows. I just don't have the patience. If I had to list something I learned from any stretch of MSNBC-watching, I might learn one thing every week and that's it. Most of the stuff they report as news is what has appeared in my RSS river during the day. Please go ahead and put ads on the site. Or ask for donations via Patreon. It's worth a few bucks a month, also because it will force MSNBC to change, to stop being so repetitive, and to start taking a look at news more broadly than just how the legal case against Trump is proceeding or not. There is other stuff going on, and there are other ideas that need exploring. They are deep in a pointless rut.",
