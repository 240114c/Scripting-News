    "text": "On the Mac we had a phonebook size doc called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Macintosh\">Inside Macintosh</a>. It was divided into toolkits, which were analogous to <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages\">packages</a>. At the beginning of each chapter was the theory, tightly written and edited. You might have to read a couple of times before grokking. Then all the calls you could make against the objects. As a result devs not only understood how to program the platform, but also understood the theory. I realize now that we are missing the equivalent doc for the web. Of course it wouldn't be printed. As a result you fumble around in the dark on a lot of stuff, not really understanding why things are the way they are, what the designers were thinking, and then years later it dawns on you. It's not too late imho to fill in this missing piece. ",
