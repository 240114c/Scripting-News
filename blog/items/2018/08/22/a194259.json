They raise the right issues. Can't we do better than just throwing away archives, esp from a project that yielded such good results. I'm also not sure what Berkman meant about the blogs being antiquated. They seem to be saying people would be better off writing on Facebook or Twitter. Blogs have significant advantages over writing for social networks. There are tradeoffs. Perhaps the server software hasn't been updated. That could be a problem. We can help with the decisions Harvard is making. But there has to be communication first.",
