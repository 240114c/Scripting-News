    "text": "Yesterday I was automatically upgraded to the new version of Gmail in the browser. The only new feature that I can see is that there's a really stupid animation that makes me wait for Gmail's UI to show up. Mail is a very integral part of my work flow. If anything they should make it load <i>faster. </i>Making the load slower is imho inexplicable and indefensible. Another beautiful feature, where the star used to appear is now a trash icon. I just deleted a message I wanted to star. Oh that really makes sense. (Sarcasm.) Now an adventure to figure out where the fuck they put deleted messages so I can undelete it. It was important (which is why I was trying to star it).",
