    "text": "There's a new brand of bike sharing in NYC now. Yesterday I saw two bright red bikes, shaped like a Lime bike or CitiBike, with a plastic basket up front. Didn't have time to read the logo/branding. Both in Manhattan. Andy DeSoto <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kadesoto/status/1033354917656911872\">says</a> they're Jump bikes. And guess what, they say on <a href=\"https://jumpbikes.com/cities/new-york-city/\">their site</a> they're available now in NYC. (But only in Staten Island and Westchester.)",
