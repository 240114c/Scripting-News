A blog that predates Google itself by four years. It's got humor and sadness, fun and tech tips. Yet all they can say is yuck we don't like this site. We welcomed Google. Even <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2002/01/10.html#yupTheUsersCared\">loved</a> them. And this is what's become of them. Heartless and soulless. Bullies. No love. ",
