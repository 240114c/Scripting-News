    "text": "I'm also going to start using <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/about\">Mastodon</a>. I see they call their posts toots. I'm sorry but that makes me think of farts. If they'd have asked me I'd have said to call them grunts or snorts. After all I can't imagine a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon\">mastodon</a> tooting. That's the kind of thing a monkey might do. BTW, little known fact, my handle on CompuServe back in the 80s was Mastodon. PS: I absolutely despise dark backgrounds. Hurts my eyes. I can only read dark text on light backgrounds. ",
