    "text": "I went to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science\">Bronx Science</a>, one of two special high schools in NYC that you have to take a test to get into. I took the test when I was in 9th grade, in the late 60s. The NYT recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/nyregion/shsat-new-york-city-schools.html\">published</a> five questions from the test. I got four of five right. The one I got wrong was controversial. They have a discussion in the Times article why no one agrees on the correct answer. I was befuddled by it too, it was the one I got wrong. I was especially pleased to have gotten the geometry question right, because I haven't thought about geometry once since I left high school. Not a whole lot of geometry in software development work, or even in a math degree.",
