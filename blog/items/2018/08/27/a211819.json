    "text": "<a href=\"http://nytimesriver.com/\">nytimesriver.com</a> began <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060902170052/http://nytimesriver.com\">in 2006</a> as an experiment to see how news reading on a Blackberry might work. I kept it running for twelve years, hoping the NYT would get the idea, and do it for itself, or even better, let me do it for them. Earlier today I got a letter from an in-house lawyer at the Times. It's a nice letter, given that a lawyer wrote it. But after all these years of being ignored, the first response is from a lawyer? That's not only rude, it's sad. So I decided the best thing to do is turn the site off. I don't feel like paying a lawyer to represent me when I'm just doing this project because I want the NYT to do better by its readers. If they decide to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch\">say thanks</a>, or even maybe buy me lunch, I'll consider turning it back on. âœ“",
