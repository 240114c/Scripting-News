And a lot of them <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+mccain&safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIzej80pXdAhWLUt8KHcC0BUoQ_AUIDCgD&biw=1383&bih=1186\">were</a> about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain\">John McCain</a>. Surprising to me that I wanted to hear more about him, even though in life, I felt I knew all I wanted. I had mixed feelings about him. I <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mccain&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=site%3Ascripting.com+mccain&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.174685j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">remember</a> when he ran against Bush and first did great and then got whipped. He does do a good New Hampshire town hall. He likes to say how honest he is, but I heard him do a lot of lying, esp about the Iraq War. That's the worst. To let people call you honest, to call yourself honest, while you're lying. That's worse than just being a liar. Anyway, he was an interesting person. One thing he said in an interview in the mid-2000s is that we should repeal Roe v Wade and then have a great debate about it. I wanted the interviewer to ask him why we can't have the debate before repealing it? I can't imagine there's anything more to say that hasn't already been said a billion times. It's a morally ambiguous situation. No amount of debating will change that. Some things just are. We will never come to agreement. Accept it. Now tell me again why appealing Roe v Wade is the right thing to do? Of course he's dead now, so we'll never know. âœ“",
