This is much appreciated by all who value the Voice, its history, and the human knowledge it represents. As far as I know, it's the first time a news organization, or a blog, when shutting down, has put effort into assuring the archive remains accessible. (If there are other examples, I'd like to hear about them.) ",

Most of the content of the Village Voice is probably already safely <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.villagevoice.com/\">stored</a> at archive.org. But what about the villagevoice.com domain? Don't we also want to preserve the links into the site, for ongoing web sites that point to the Voice? Or when someone reads the preserved Scripting News, if I'm able to get that done, be able to click a link to a great Voice article and not get a 404? That's analogous to preserving ancient Rome in addition to remembering its history. (BTW, some of it's already gone. Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/03.html#When:2:56:16AM\">post</a> on this blog from 2004 that links to a VV article. Not found. Ouch.)",

The web, as a historic medium is far less than imperfect, it's temporary. Only present as long as someone keeps paying the bills. And there's no way to pay the bills far in advance, so the historic record has a literally no chance of surviving, given the current state of things. ",
