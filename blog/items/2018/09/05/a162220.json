    "text": "John Gruber <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/09/04/medium-domain-name\">says</a> what we're thinking. Why, if you can't map a domain to your site on Medium, would you use it to host a blog. Rafat Ali, another longtime blogger, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rafat/status/1037371592496570372\">says</a> once Medium shuts down there should be an ethical replacement. I wonder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037372465599668225\">why</a> they can't co-exist, and then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037372969520168961\">answer</a> my own question. The problem isn't cost, or the tech -- it's users. Medium has momentum, still, as the place-of-record for web writing, much as YouTube is it for video. It's a shaky foundation. No business model, huge money already invested. Not a good situation.",
