    "text": "My own opinion. Kavanaugh will not be confirmed. I expect <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Blasey_Ford\">Christine Ford</a> to be a compelling witness. Reporters will interview <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/17/17870642/mark-judge-brett-kavanaugh-friend-christine-ford\">classmates</a> of hers and of Kavanaugh's. Some Repubs on the <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/\">Judiciary Committee</a> understand enough about the issue to be far more <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/09/lindsey-graham-kavanaughs-christine-ford-accusations/\">sensitive</a> than they were with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Hill\">Anita Hill</a>. But <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/09/17/orrin-hatch-says-kavanaugh-accuser-may-be-mixed-up/\">some</a> will not, and this will spark rage at Republicans including from within their own base. A lot of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/the-reasons-why-white-women-vote-republican-and-what-to-do-about-it/\">women</a> vote Republican. There's a decent chance a handful of Repub senators will quit the party, or even become Democrats. As I said <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/09/17.html#a030123\">yesterday</a>, governing has become a burden for the Repubs. They know how to bully, they know how to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland\">obstruct</a>, but this is far more complex. They won't be able to hold their coalition together. Think of it as an intra-party wedge issue for the Repubs.",
