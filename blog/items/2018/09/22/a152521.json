    "text": "I'm rolling through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(miniseries)\">Maniac</a> on Netflix and loving it. Jonah Hill, Emma Stone, Justin Theroux, Sally Field. Hill and Stone are incredible together. It's a bit of everything, The Matrix, Inception, Big Lebowski, Cloud Atlas, so many other things. I'm just starting episode 7 and rationing it. I don't want it to be over. It's the best thing in a long time.  Update: Other movies it borrows from -- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind\">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>, Borat and The Graduate. Also Good Will Hunting. Best line: Gas up the Miata!",
