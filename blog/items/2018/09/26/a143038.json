    "text": "<a href=\"http://history.userland.com/\">Here's a page</a> with a list of all the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/frontier/manual/chapter06.html\">object databases</a> for userland.com websites, available for download. Many of the sites are still running, thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsavin\">Jake Savin</a>. I want to be sure that in the future as much of what we created at UserLand is preserved. You need a copy of Frontier or the <a href=\"http://home.opml.org/\">OPML Editor</a> to read these files. ",
