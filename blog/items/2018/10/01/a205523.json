    "text": "I listened to today's <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/10/01/254049.html\">Daily podcast</a>. Very good. Not listening to victims of abuse is an American tradition. As I've said in two recent pieces, abuse is the context of our civilization. It's everywhere. In homes and schools, offices, Congress, and you can be sure this isn't the first time a Supreme Court nominee has been a rapist (assuming he did it, which I do). We all have to learn how to listen. But getting some to listen is a start. ",
