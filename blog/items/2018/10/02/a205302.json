    "text": "I've listened to all of what people are saying about Brett Kavanaugh, and it all adds up to a person who should not be a judge, and certainly not on the Supreme Court. But you can put it all aside, the lying about drinking and abuse, put it all aside except for one bit -- his <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/02/kavanaughExcerpt.png\">introduction</a> to his <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/misc/kavanaughTranscript.md\">testimony</a> on Thursday. Where he unmasked as what he obviously is, a partisan Republican operator. There's certainly a role for that, I guess, though I wish our politicians would have more respect for the people they govern, but in that testimony he gave us fair warning on who he is. It's up to us to believe him. It was obvious because he was part of the Bush White House, a highly manipulative and imho corrupt administration. I say that without an ounce of partisanship, because I voted for Bush in 2000. By 2004, I understood that I had made a huge mistake. But Kavanaugh never left it behind. Don't take my word for it, just listen to what he said and remember what <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/335-when-someone-shows-you-who-they-are-believe-them-the\">Maya Angelou</a> said: “When someone shows you who they are believe them; the first time.” ",
