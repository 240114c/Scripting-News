    "text": "Some TV series are special, like dessert, like a rich layer cake with lots of sweet frosting and butter. You eat the slice slowly, savoring every bite, and even so it disappears too quickly. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul\">Better Call Saul</a> is like that. Some episodes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones\">Game of Thrones</a>. The entirety of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire\">The Wire</a>. And lately, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(miniseries)\">Maniac</a> on Netflix was savory in that sense. NakedJen is watching it now. Hope she loves it. I just saw a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanDotLewis/status/1047845366681554944\">note</a> from a friend on Twitter saying he had watched four episodes of Maniac and was giving up. I know the feeling. I went through that with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Rock_(TV_series)\">Castle Rock</a>. The first episodes were great but then I lost interest. I did manage to muddle through, because I wanted to know how it ended. Then there are shows that everyone loves that I can't even get started with. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)\">Peaky Blinders</a>, for example. Or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)\">The Expanse</a>. I cannot figure out wtf is going on in that one. I feel if I can just gain traction I'll love it. But I never have been able to.",
