    "text": "In the early days of #metoo there wasn't much point in trying to say that there were men who were respectful of women. Men who see women as people, just like they are, and believe in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\">Golden Rule</a>, and apply it. There was an angry hashtag for this, #notallmen, which translated as #wedontwanttohearit. Even so, I believe that most women get that men are people, just like they are. We know that there are all kinds of people of all genders, with issues that were created through their families or genes or other factors. There are differences in bodies and strength, but I have wanted to say that our bodies are the same size online. It was therefore refreshing to see this <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/10/4/17933530/sexual-assault-me-too\">piece</a>, that started as a Twitter thread, written by a woman, who says what imho needed to be said.",
