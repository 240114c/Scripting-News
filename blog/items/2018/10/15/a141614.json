    "text": "I've known Don Park for a long time. Goes back to when I lived in the middle of the golf course at the end of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sharon+Park+Dr,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.4248451,-122.2205468,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa4e515ff326d:0xc832d9097802f942!8m2!3d37.4244532!4d-122.2083052\">Sharon Park Drive</a> in Menlo Park. Don did the INIT for <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/TNM_Userland_IAC_Toolkit_for_programmers_1991_20170830_0072/page/n0\">UserLand IAC Toolkit</a>, which <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=UserLand+IAC+Toolkit&t=h_&ia=web\">was</a> the precursor for the Apple Event Manager and ultimately XML-RPC and SOAP. Don is thinking about blogs these days, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/donpark/status/1051533792324636673\">posted</a> something <a href=\"https://twitter.com/donpark/status/1051544612911738880\">interesting</a> on Twitter yesterday about blogrolls. He says wtf happened. There is no good discovery mechanism for blogs. I agree. Don had some immediate ideas, so I offered to start a thread on it, so maybe we could come up with some experiments we could do to see if maybe we couldn't bootstrap something now. That's what the previous post, the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/10/15.html#a141922\">braintrust query</a> is about.",
