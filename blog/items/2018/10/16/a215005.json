    "text": "Here's a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052224515932073990\">weird idea</a> I proposed to one of my favorite political analysts. Why can't journalism raise issues? They don't have to let politicians drive this. Don't the voters have issues that need airing? What about the people who wrote the Constitution who expected Congress to act as a check on the Executive branch? Why do we have to sit on the sidelines and accept the crap they hand us. Now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052317163778990081\">Elizabeth Warren</a> is doing it. Jeez. You'd think they wrote off the intellect and seriousness of the electorate. Time to change the way we do things. Journalism could be where the change starts. Of course they would have to listen, for a new idea to penetrate. :boom:",
