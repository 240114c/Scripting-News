    "text": "I switched away from the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/10/17/knicks-put-on-a-show-and-open-season-with-hawks-destruction/\">Knicks</a> season opener to watch the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/25011260/fan-interferes-attempt-boston-red-sox-mookie-betts-catch-ball\">ALCS playoffs</a> for a few minutes. When I came back the Knicks had set a record for the most points in a 2nd quarter by any Knicks team. Yes the Hawks suck. But still.. Could this Knicks team be a winner? Failing that could they at least be fun? It's been so long, 2012 to be specific, since the Knicks were fun to be a fan of. Meanwhile over in Houston, the <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texas-sports-nation/rockets/article/3-pointers-Takeaways-from-the-Rockets-loss-to-13316609.php\">Rockets</a> have the Curse of Carmelo. I feel sorry for the old man. I really do. He was the heart of the Knicks for so long. Hate to see him become a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_(sports)\">journeyman</a>, the way he made <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2013/12/19/whatIfTheKnicksHadKeptJeremyLin.html\">Jeremy Lin</a> leave home. I guess <i>what goes around comes around</i> applies. Funny coincidence, Lin, who now comes off the bench for the Hawks, played in last night's game at the Garden. He was a bit rusty at first, but the old magic is still there, you can see it. ",
