    "text": "Terry Heaton sent a note yesterday reminding me that the original BloggerCon was held in October 2003, in other words, exactly 15 years ago this month. We missed the actual days, which I can infer from <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/10.html\">my blog</a> was October <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/10/04.html\">4</a> and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/10/05.html\">5</a>. Unfortunately the first archive.org <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040818060437/http://www.bloggercon.org:80/\">snapshot</a> of the BloggerCon home page was in 2004, when were getting ready for BloggerCon III at Stanford. I'm going to keep looking on my servers and backups for data about the first BloggerCon. I'm going to archive that as I started <a href=\"http://history.userland.com/\">archiving</a> the old userland.com websites last month. ",
