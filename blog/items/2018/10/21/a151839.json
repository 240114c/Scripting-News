    "text": "I wish there was a Busy Developer's Guide to <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>. Maybe there is? I am an experienced web CMS developer. I have implemented lots of frameworks. I'd love to see a concise how-it-works doc, with good examples. For example, I'd love to see a repo containing a Jekyll website that I can poke around in to see how the pieces fit together. It's one thing to read about it, the fastest way to learn is to see it in action. I'd also love to see a quick spec for what a Jekyll theme is. ",
