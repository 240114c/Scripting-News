    "text": "This Neil deGrasse Tyson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SXHMm5I-68\">segment</a> on the evolution of the eye helped me understand something important about evolution. \"We like to think of our eyes as state of the art, but 375 million years later, we still can't see things right in front of our noses, or discern fine details in near-darkness the way fish can. When we left the water why didn't nature just start over again and evolve us a new set of eyes that were optimal for seeing in the air? Nature doesn't work that way. Evolution reshapes existing structures over generations, adapting them with small changes. It can't just go back to the drawing board and start from scratch.\" ",
