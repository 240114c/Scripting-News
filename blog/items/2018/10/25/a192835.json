    "text": "I was thanked via email yesterday for my political posts on <a href=\"http://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a>. A funny thing for sure, because I was not aware that my blog posts appear there. I guess Manton must have hooked up my \"RSS\" feed to my account on his site. Or maybe I did it and forgot? Either way, it's good, the more people who can hear me the better. The magic of open formats and protocols at work. ",
