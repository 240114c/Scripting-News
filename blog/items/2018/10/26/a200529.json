    "text": " I read a post this morning by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1055890611105087493\">Evan McMullen</a>, a conservative Republican saying \"the next political tribe in America will care about everyone.\" I commented \"sign me up.\" Then someone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bob2cleo/status/1055890152256618497\">said</a> \"That's the Democrats.\" And I thought \"That's bullshit.\" You want to keep losing elections, keep demonizing white men. There's a lot of resentment building, the Repubs have figured out how to tap into it. On the other hand McMullen's theoretical party, by design, will care about everyone. ",
