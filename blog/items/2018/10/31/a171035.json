Lakoff's view is as far as I'm concerned exactly right. Republicans represent the strict father, and Democrats the nuturing mother. When you vote Republican it's probably because in the house you grew up in the father was a strong figure and the mother not. If you vote Democratic, you're seeking the mother, because that's what you trust. ",

It matters how you present an idea more than what the idea actually is. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act\">Partial birth abortion</a>, for example, sounds horrible. But if you or a family member needed an abortion to save their life, you'd see it differently. Framing. Lakoff says \"Don't think about an elephant\" as Trump might say \"Don't kill Jews.\" When Trump says it, he's putting the idea of You -> Killing -> Jews in your head. He can say he said not to do it. But it's just as effective at planting the idea when negated.",

It's the way the mind works. Lakoff sees that clearly, but TV pundits and Democrats don't know this. They really don't. They think facts are how people make up their minds. ",

He says \"Don't think about the elephant,\" and leaves it to the listener to figure it out. The other panelist and perhaps the moderator have no idea what he's talking about, and unless you had read his book, or attended a lecture, or listened to a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/02/25/interviewWithGeorgeLakoff.html\">podcast</a>, you couldn't. No discussion happens, it's a wasted opportunity. I've seen this happen twice now. Frustrating as hell. Because it's hard to explain how fucked up a system is within the system itself. ",

Since then it's been practiced by football, basketball, and other baseball teams with much success. Moneyball says you should look at what factors make a difference in winning, and do that. An inexpensive hitter who reliably gets on base, even by walking, is more central to winning than an expensive high percentage hitter. You look at the numbers and do what they say to do. The As, a poor team, couldn't afford to buy the great players, so instead they bought players that made them win. :boom:",
