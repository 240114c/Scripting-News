    "text": "In April, I set up a <a href=\"http://newriver5.glitch.me/\">demo river</a> on <a href=\"https://glitch.com/\">Glitch</a>, an interesting development system for people getting started in Node. They don't charge to run your application, but if it isn't accessed frequently they put it to sleep, and wake it up next time it's accessed. Just for fun I tried installing River5. It works! And even better, here we are six months later, and the app is still running, and doing a great job of getting the news. I would have thoughth it would have to do a scan for new news when I accessed it, but it's been reading news all night. There must be other people using it? Not sure. But it's good. :rocket:",
