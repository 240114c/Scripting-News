    "text": "I finally found something to buy that I'm genuinely excited about. I keep a second monitor to the left of my main screen. I think of it as a rear-view-mirror in a car. It's where I keep the status readouts, hit counters, server monitors, etc. I watch TV on that monitor (via Spectrum's website). Anyway, the monitor has, until now, been an old Apple screen from 2006 or so. I had bought it to go with my old Mac Pro. That old monitor can't plug into my new iMac Pro. So then I thought, let's buy a new one. Of course monitors have gotten a lot better and cheaper since 2006. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IZBIMLK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">new one</a> is going to be glorious, or so I think. Should arrive later today via Amazon.
