    "text": "This morning <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/11/01.html#a153716\">Dropbox</a> is down to 1.2 million files. Yes, I have <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/syncing-uploads/lan-sync-overview\">LAN Sync</a> turned on, on this machine and on the other machines connected to the same router. I've come up with a new temporary way to get files up to the server so my development work can continue while Dropbox is synching. Also, yes I need to be able to see my whole Dropbox structure from this machine. (Thanks for all the suggestions, I've been using Dropbox since it came out, that's a pretty long time.)",
