There is divergence of views, but there is also conventional wisdom, and access journalism and the economics, all of which drive journalism to a sameness. An example, in the mid 90s the conventional wisdom was that there was no new Mac software. You'd see it reported everywhere. It wasn't true. It just made it impossible to launch new software, so eventually it became self-fullfilling. ",

Not just in the aggregate, but as individuals. Journalism if it ever had the ability to tell that story seems to have lost it. ",

Because so many other people are, there are many incentives to use the same language everyone else does. (And of course I'm taking license with the term \"everyone\" -- of course other languages are also very popular.)",
