    "text": "Earlier today I wrote a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1061987263024902149\">tweet</a> that started getting a lot of flow. Then I thought this is possibly something Jay Rosen could endorse. So I sent an email, he RTd and then the flow went up quite a bit more. I noted, again via email: \"If your influence keeps growing, you could probably solve some of journalism's problems just with your flow.\" I was thinking of picking out voices that weren't being heard in the journalism-centered conversations but if they were, might adjust how it covers the changed world as we find it today. :boom:",
