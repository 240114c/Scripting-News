    "text": "I was just telling a friend about Al Pacino's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myyWXKeBsNk\">speech</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday\">Any Given Sunday</a>. I know a lot of people don't like sports movies but this one is the story of age, how the coach and the young quarterback (played by Jamie Foxx)  learn to work together. It's got all the schmaltz of typical sports movie. But the acting is so good, and the story simple and universal and heart-grabbing. Old people remember being young. We aren't young anymore, but we have experience and knowledge to offer, and when we work together the winning is so much sweeter. I would like the newly elected <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/20/pelosi-democrats-candidates-midterms-655484\">Democrat reps</a> to watch this movie and work with Nancy Pelosi. She knows how to win. We have a really big problem to solve and we have to work together to solve it. If we don't work together, we'll die as individuals. ",
