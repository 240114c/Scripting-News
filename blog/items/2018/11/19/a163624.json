He failed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Lin#New_York_Knicks_(2011%E2%80%932012)\">Linsanity</a>. God came to his rescue. Gave him a player who was <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=ecstatic\">glad</a> to be in the NBA, who would mold his game to make Melo the star that he was always capable of being. Melo didn't want anyone else in the spotlight. Goodbye Lin. Just imagine what the three guys in <a href=\"http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/02/25/meloLin.gif\">this picture</a> could have done. The only thing in the way was Melo's hubris.",
