    "text": "So my back hurts, I just slogged through a depressing <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/11/20.html#a135741\">series</a>. It's cold and dreary in NYC. I hear about the new Coen Brothers movie, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Buster_Scruggs\">The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</a>, on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80200267\">Netflix</a>, and it's getting good reviews from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/movies/the-ballad-of-buster-scruggs-review.html\">AO Scott</a> and a friend who knows me well. So I sit down to watch. It's weird, episodic, but a movie not a series. I had heard the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers\">Coens</a> were working on a series. The first segment was funny, I actually lol'd a few times. The second was okay, but the third sent me in a tailspin of depression. Oh no this is not what I had in mind. I was hoping for Fargo or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski\">Lebowski</a>, but this makes No Country look like a fun dramedy. A few hours later I picked it up again, and it got better, way better. The segments were very Coen-ish, both funny and tragic. You know. Like the end of even the funniest Coen-y movies. I say go ahead and watch it, but if it's bumming you out, realize that's not all it's doing. The whole thing is a massive joke, on you.  :boom:",
