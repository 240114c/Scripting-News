    "text": "A couple of changes to how Likes work <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">here</a>. 1. On new posts, Likes are on by default. I can still turn them off on each post. 2. Instead of saying \"8 Likes\" it now just says 8. It's easier on the eyes, and maybe it's just a ping and not necessarily a like. We will still call them likes.",
