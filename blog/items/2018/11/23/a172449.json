That way feed readers if they were so inclined, could hook up all the readers of my blog to my Likes system. We'd have a nice little network for Liking stuff <i>without Facebook</i> in the middle. I find this is a very nice soft way of finding out who's reading my blog. Everyone is opt-in on everything. People want this from their blogs (Dries <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dries/status/1065592741458075650\">mentioned</a> this yesterday) and everyone with a podcast wants to know who listened. The thing is to make it easy for people to share that bit of info, rather than extracting it without permission. It's the web way of doing tracking. I love this. Now if NPM would just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1066024770762928129\">get out</a> of the way. :boom:",
