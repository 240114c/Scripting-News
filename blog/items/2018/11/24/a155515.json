I wanted to see what would happen if I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/24/deletedFiles.png\">nuked</a> the data folder on my main \"River5\" installation. So that's what I did today. You'll see the effect anywhere one of my rivers appears. For example, this is what <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/\">podcatch.com</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/24/podcatchHomePage.png\">looks like</a> right now. Hopefully that will change when the next podcast shows up, and by Monday there should be a full complement. ",
