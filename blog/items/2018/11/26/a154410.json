    "text": "I recently switched from an iPhone 6S to an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-Fully-Unlocked/dp/B07HCTCMT7\">iPhone XS Max</a>. Along the way it never occurred to me that I was giving up my <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90270691/i-still-miss-my-headphone-jack-and-i-want-it-back\">headphone jack</a>. The 6S has one the XS does not. I guess it's less of an issue to me now because in 2018 it seems Bluetooth works reliably. Previous iPhones, headphones and speakers would lose their pairing regularly. This got super annoying when I'm out riding my bike, it means stopping and fiddling around with the phone while I really want to be moving. Eventually I gave up on Bluetooth for that application and went to a hard wire connection. The speakers all still have the headphone jack. Now I guess I'm entering a new frontier. But I still have my iPhone 6S in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/26/junkDrawer.png\">right top drawer</a> of my desk along with all the other obsolete hardware I couldn't manage to actually throw away. BTW, I love the XS. Not sure exactly why, but I do. :heart:",
