All the characters are interesting, the story keeps unfolding in interesting ways, the acting is superb, you really get involved in the story. Now starting <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Sinner-Season-2/dp/B07FQ7RPKR\">season 2</a> on Amazon, for $15. So far it's just as good as the first.  :rocket:",
