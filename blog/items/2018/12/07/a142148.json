I could have written that piece myself. In fact in a way I <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">did</a>. But Mozilla hasn't listened any better than Google. Maybe if we want to keep the thread of a free web alive, we should listen better, and <i>help each other. </i>That was the original spirit of the web, not the dominance of big companies who don't feel obligated to listen to and work with individuals. To me, Mozilla looks as big as Google looks to them. ",
