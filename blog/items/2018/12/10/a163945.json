This is the main thing I focus on. It's also what the new news ventures are most vague about, because they, like me, don't understand how it works. But it has to work. There's an enormous amount of knowledge and experience and writing ability among the people that is not in any way being tapped by journalism. It's why Quartz has a new app, and TheC focuses on membership. After the paywall coming down, it's the next thing to figure out. The news org that does can be almost as big and rich as Facebook imho. I don't think anyone will ever again have as much market share as FB, but their situation is not sustainable. More in the podcast. Please listen. ",
