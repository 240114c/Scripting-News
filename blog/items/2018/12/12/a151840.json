    "text": "<a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/105\">Braintrust query</a>: I keep reading about Kubernetes and how it's taking over the world, but every piece also says it's very complicated. Why? Heroku set the initial prior art in this area. It's easy to get started with. Here we are many years later, it seems we are going the wrong way. Or am I missing the point. Isn't Kubernetes trying to solve the same problem as Heroku? In any case an open source user-deployable Heroku would be very welcome.  Update: Digital Ocean <a href=\"https://blog.digitalocean.com/digitalocean-releases-k8s-as-a-service/\">introduced</a> a simplified Kubernetes <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/\">service</a> yesterday. I had no idea. Also, <a href=\"http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/\">Dokku</a> was <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/105#issuecomment-446627116\">recommended</a>. ",
