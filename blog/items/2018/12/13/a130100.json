When I think of a movement I think of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement\">civil rights movement</a> of the 1960s, or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement#Vietnam_War\">anti-war movement</a> that protested the Vietnam war. I do not think The Correspondent which is a for-profit business deserves to use that term. I certainly do not like them saying that I am a member of such a \"movement.\" As I said in my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/12/11/131151.html\">writeup</a>, \"the only movement I would be part of is one that doesn't distinguish between reporters and members, that has a level playing field. I think that's the only way journalism can scale to meet our needs and avoid the kinds of disasters journalism has led us to.\" ",
