    "text": "I met <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dabeard\">David Beard</a> at a future-of-journalism <a href=\"https://www.newsgeist.org/exploring-future-news/\">conference</a> in Phoenix last year, and spent a couple of hours talking with him at the Phoenix airport waiting for planes home to Boston and NYC, respectively. Since then I've been watching what he does on Twitter with awe and interest. He posts links to stories with comments that are very widely circulated. Some of his tweets get thousands of RTs. You might think he has a million followers, but he doesn't, just 47K, though it seems to be increasing quickly. I always wonder what his secret is, and what his goal is. By asking the question on my blog, I hope to provoke a public response. :boom:",
