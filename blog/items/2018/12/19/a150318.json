Journalism exterts control and influence. Gatekeeping. They keep lots of ideas out of the news, esp ones they find uncomfortable. Show me an op-ed in the NYT about the future of journalism that says they should compete with Facebook. Or a public editor who is a member of the public? Also any industry that feels they should be above examination, and has been exempt for so long, must be <i>filled</i> with corruption. And of course if there's no corruption, there's no harm in looking, right? ",
