    "text": "Uncle Davey's remedy for all your end-of-year Facebook woes. New rule requires Facebook to peer with the open web so people who are not on Facebook can communicate with people who are. All or nothing is the real problem. Lots of precedent. AT&T had a monopoly over phones for a long time. If you wanted to make phone calls you had to use one of their devices. That rule changed and the rest is history. The technology is easy. There are plenty of people at Facebook who want to do it. ",
