Apple could have continued to have a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/i-still-miss-the-headphone-port/\">headphone jack</a> on their phones, and all the other phone makers would have kept theirs. I'd still use my Bluetooth headphones (I was a wireless fan long before the headphone jack disappeared). It's the same reason we should all support <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">HTTP</a> for as long as humanly possible (i.e. forever). This is a big philosophical question for all tech developers. I'm a continuity absolutist, to me the most awful word in tech is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation\">deprecate</a>.
