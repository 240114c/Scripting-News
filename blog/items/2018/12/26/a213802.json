    "text": "I had no way of knowing how well the two shows I've been bingeing fit together. They are <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70260350\">River</a>, which is the story of a crazy grieving brilliant cop who learns to accept his insanity, and <a href=\"https://www.sho.com/kidding\">Kidding</a>, a crazy grieving Mr Rogers type TV actor.
