Here he is <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/12/27/proudMamaEveWithInfantPeterAndUncleDaveyExpressingConcern.png\">pictured</a> shortly after birth on this day in 1958.

We're all that's left of the clan <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2018/12/27/evesFamilyInRockaway.png\">pictured here</a>, taken in 1961 or 1962. Time is a funny thing. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFxjnUPRwx4\">As they say</a> it all seems like yesterday. It goes by in a flash.",
