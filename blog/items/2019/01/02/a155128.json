I'm trying to say we don't have a good way to explain features in languages and environments to people who aren't schooled in the environment. So if I say X has a feature no other environment has, people will <i>always</i> say it \"sounds like\" something they've seen in environment A, B and C. But \"sounds like\" is not good enough. If for example Billy Joel were to claim he had written a great new song, then played it on the piano and it was obviously Hey Jude, you could say Hey Billy that \"sounds like\" <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A_MjCqQoLLA?t=48\">Hey Jude</a> and you'd have a good idea that you are right. Because music has a universal instrument for sharing tunes, the piano. Software does not. I hoped JavaScript would be it. But maybe it is. I'll try demoing the feature I was talking about in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/12/30/124007.html\">piece</a> Jon was commenting on, using JavaScript.",
