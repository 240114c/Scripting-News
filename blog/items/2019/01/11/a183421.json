    "text": "HBO has been playing all the Sopranos episodes back to back for a few days. Yesterday by luck I hit on the very last episode. Earlier in the day I <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/the-sopranos-ending-does-tony-die.html\">read a debate</a> on what happened at the end. I am of the school that yeah of course he died, but the person who took the opposite position was convincing. We don't know what happened at the end so leave it there. But I got to see all the scenes that were discussed, the same day. Intense, and fun. ",
