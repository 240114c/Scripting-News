    "text": "More on the dual-major journalism and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/10/17/howIdTeachComputerScience.html\">computer science</a> program. Yesterday I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/01/10.html#a175302\">wrote</a> how that could be great for journalism, now I want to talk about the flip side, how it's great for the software journalists use, i.e. publishing software. In my experience the best software is that which is designed by people who use the product. They bump against the limits as users do, think of shortcuts and simplifications (called factoring in software). If you don't use the software your ideas about how it should work are theoretical. The closer you are to the user experience, the better you understand the tradeoffs from the user's perspective. And that ultimately is the most important one. So applied to this dual-major concept when the students learn their comp sci, it can be in the context of how journalists use computer systems. And with better understanding of users on the part of the students, after all they <i>are</i> users, the better the publishing software can be. ",
