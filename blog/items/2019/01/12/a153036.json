Later I remembered I was archiving my Flickr site in an S3 bucket and this morning I figured out where it was. And now I'm looking through old pictures, that are already saved. For example, in <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/january/\">January 2007</a> I went to CES and (apparently) was moving into my new house in Berkeley. In <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/\">June</a> I was in Rome, and also was waiting in <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/dscn7807jpg\">line</a> with the <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/dscn7800jpg\">Scobles</a> for the very first <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/afterTappingTheScreen\">iPhone</a>. A <a href=\"http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/theseGuysWereInterestedInMyIphone\">picture</a> I took with my new iPhone at my favorite sushi takeout place in Berkeley. ",
