It's hard for men (and women too) to defend the gender without invoking the ire of others, so mostly people stay silent and let the myth that men are responsible for the problems in our society go unchallenged. But you can push back via private acts, like choosing another brand, or voting. In private contexts you can be very vocal without fear of retribution. So even if you don't hear the pushback, it could come at the cash register.  ",
