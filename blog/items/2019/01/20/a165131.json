Her company is suffocating the open web, so itâ€™s really not her question to ask. Imho, ultimately we'll think of the big tech companies the way we think of any powerful dominant industry. Imagine the CEO of Exxon on stage asking What Kind of Environment Do We Want? The pundits would say \"see there's nothing to worry about, Exxon wants the best for us.\" And of course they don't. Not their job. ",
