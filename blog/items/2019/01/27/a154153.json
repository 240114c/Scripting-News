    "text": "Today is my maternal grandfather's birthday, <a href=\"http://rudykiesler.com/\">Rudy Kiesler</a>. I don't remember what year he was born, perhaps 1908? But I will likely never forget the day he was born. I also remember my paternal grandfather's birthday -- May 1, 1899. One day before mine (in 1955). I don't remember my father's birthday, there was always confusion about it. There was his real birthday and his official birthday which was transcribed incorrectly at Ellis Island when they emigrated. ",
