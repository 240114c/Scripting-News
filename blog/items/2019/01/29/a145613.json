But we have yet to take the turn dictated by the web <i class=\"fa fa-arrow-right\" style=\"color: gray\"></i> <i>create a hybrid pub that behaves both like the NYT and Facebook.</i> A level playing field. Allow amateurs to compete with pros. Initially the home page is populated by the pros (much like what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/moments\">Twitter is doing</a>, Jack and company obviously gets this), with the occasional piece by an amateur. Since each act of journalism is just an amalgram of source quotes, we would try to draw the most authoritative sources into our network. Over time, learn what part of the editorial process must be paid, and what part will be done by amateurs, out of love, out of civic pride, and wanting to solve the vexing problems that our species faces. We've run out of time to dick around. ",
