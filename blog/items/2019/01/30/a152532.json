    "text": "I accepted an invitation to speak at a future-of-news conference. Like all other such conferences it's sponsored by at least one big <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">tech company</a>. They get their name on the program, and presumably a booth in the hallway. Probably a session or two focused on their role in the future-of-news ecosystem. And they have a more insidious effect, their presence makes sure that speakers don't criticize them too much, because they're all hoping to get some of the money they've earmarked to support struggling news orgs. I am also the only non-professional speaker, the only blogger, the only user of news. My experience with these conferences is awful. People are polite enough when I speak, but nothing comes of it. I never get invited back. This morning I wonder why I accepted. ",
