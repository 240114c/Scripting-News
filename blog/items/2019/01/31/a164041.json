    "text": "I'm rewatching The Sopranos. The first few seasons were uneven, but by the end of Season 5 it was great. The last two episodes were magnificent. Dramatic, moving, with a lot of comedy (I hadn't remembered how many laughs there were in the show). Outstanding characters. The best writing. Virtuoso acting.  ",
