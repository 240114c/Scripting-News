    "text": "An idea for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union\">EU</a>. Why not offer personal membership in the EU to citizens of countries that withdraw from the EU. Benefits might include, they get to keep their EU passport. They can freely move between EU countries as before. They can vote in EU elections. Might lead to something interesting, like a new political party in the withdrawing country?",
