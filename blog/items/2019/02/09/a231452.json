    "text": "I just completed a binge-watch of all six Sopranos seasons. One thing to note. The last season was awful. It was a total slog to get through all 21 episodes. I kept putting it down it was so bad compared to the other seasons. But the awfulness of the last season makes me think that the contentious ending of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_America_(The_Sopranos)\">last episode</a> might have just been a punt by a writer's room that had clearly run out of gas. They didn't know how to end the series, so they didn't. BTW one of the great things about having a blog is that I can show you <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2007/06/11/theSopranosAftermath.html\">what I thought</a> of the last episode at the time it aired. Basically I wasn't buying it: \"The Sopranos was a mess, and it ended in an unsatisfying cop-out.\"",
