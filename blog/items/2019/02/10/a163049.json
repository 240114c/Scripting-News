    "text": "As you may know I'm shopping for a car. I'm using a number of car-rating sites, including <a href=\"http://consumerreports.org\">Consumer Reports</a> where I am a member. I wanted to use their <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-prices-build-buy-service/index.htm?ep=A37\">pricing service</a>, but they ask for a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/02/10/whatsYourPhoneNumber.png\">phone number</a> before letting you in. This was a deal-stopper at first, but eventually I relented and entered my number. Immediately I was taken to a screen that said that a dealer would contact me <i>by phone. </i>No opt out. I was not warned this would happen. I assumed that because this was <a href=\"https://carbuying.consumerreports.org/register/?exteriorColorId=952534&viprMakeId=60&viprMakeName=Subaru&viprModelId=8219&viprStyleId=63359\">integrated</a> with Consumer Reports website that it would treat me, the consumer, fairly. I just got a call from the dealer. I didn't take it. A waste of all our time, but most importantly a waste of CR's rep. They took a big hit here with me. Which sucks because trust is central to the service they sell. [Update: It's turning into a spamfest. The dealer, <a href=\"https://www.berterasubaru.com/\">Bertera Subaru</a>, has called twice, sent three text messages and two emails, so far. Another update. When I asked Andrew Luzio of Bertera to stop spamming me, he responded with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/02/10/moreSpamFromBertera.png\">more spam</a>.]",
