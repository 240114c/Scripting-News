They do actually post a lot of fake news. It's so screwed up that Trump actually is right about this. I'm not saying the Times can or should change, I don't think they can. But I also don't accept that all I can do is sit on the sidelines and watch the world descend deeper into the abyss. These conferences tend to generate their own reality, as does the news industry. Problem is that reality is getting further and further from what's actually happening. ",

We have to get more going here than us giving money to reporters who don't listen to us. That's basically the answer the news industry has for me. Give us money. Well you have to do better than that.
