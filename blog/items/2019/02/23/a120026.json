This is wrong. As a US government employee, a member of Congress, his writing should be accessible to every American. Putting it behind a paywall is not open. They must stop using private websites to communicate publicly. The US government should provide a well-archived public website for them to post their thoughts on. A place of record. This is not rocket science in 2019. I cc'd this to my friend <a href=\"http://jeremyzilar.com/\">Jeremy Zilar</a> who works for the US at <a href=\"http://jeremyzilar.com/work/digitalgov/\">Digital.gov</a>, which is responsible for these kinds of projects.
