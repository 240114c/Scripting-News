When making a request of a process running on the same server, I get an <span style=\"font-size: .8em\">ECONNREFUSED</span>. This has happened on two servers. The code used to work. Then I tried accessing the server through the CURL command line utility and it also failed. Yet if I access the same address from another computer, it works. I'm at a loss. ",
