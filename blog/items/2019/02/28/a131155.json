I can start the engine, or make it flash its lights and honk its horn. This is worrisome of course, because if I can do it, so can a hacker. But it's also fun, since it's in a parking garage in Manhattan, I could just start the engine and freak out the people who work there. Not that I would be the first to do that. (Note: I'm not going to do it.)",
