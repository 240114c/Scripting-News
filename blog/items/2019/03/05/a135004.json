    "text": "Another thing I learned is that the vertical drop on Catskills ski areas are pretty good. The big difference is elevation. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Ski_Center\">Belleayre</a>, where I was skiing yesterday has a base elevation of 2000 feet, compared to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Valley\">Deer Valley</a> at 6500 feet. That's why the snow is so much nicer at the latter. It rains a bunch in the winter in the Catskills. Enough to make the snow wet sometimes and icy others. But yesterday it was perfect. The snow was the kind of stuff Utah is famous for. ",
