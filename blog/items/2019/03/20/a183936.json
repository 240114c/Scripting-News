    "text": "Yesterday's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/podcasts/the-daily/boeing-737-max-ethiopia-crash.html\">Daily podcast</a> about Boeing's bug was interesting because bugs are starting to be mainstream life and death issues and the cost of lack of interop was frontmost in Boeing's decision to mask the difference in the two models of 737 using a compatibility bridge. Developer tool developers should be so concerned about the cost of re-training. Lots to process for techies. I listened to the podcast driving down the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway\">NYS Thruway</a> in my Forester that <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/03/17.html#a035213\">nudges</a> you to stay in your lane. I always think, what if there's a bug in this system, it might make my car do something like what the Boeing planes were doing. But I leave it on, because I like what it's doing, at least for now.",
