    "text": "From what I hear on MSNBC, we have no idea what the Mueller report says. We only know what Barr says the report says. Reminds me of a Watergate story. Nixon didn't want to release the tapes because they would incriminate him. So he got a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Stennis\">Democratic senator</a> from the south who mostly voted Republican to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stennis_Compromise\">listen</a> to the tapes, and he came out and said basically Nixon is right, nothing criminal here. It didn't work. The tapes ultimately were released. The more the Repubs don't want the Mueller report released, the more it says it <i>must</i> be released. No one is going to give up on this. ",
