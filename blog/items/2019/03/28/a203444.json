I didn't care where their office was. I did object to them claiming to be revolutionary, because I didn't see any evidence of that. I come from the tech industry which indulged in this kind of hype many many times, and fortunes were made, a lot more than $2.7 million, over less than what The Correspondent had. I had high hopes for them, and in the end when I saw the plan I saw that they either didn't understand, or they punted and decided to do something pretty normal, but to hype it as if it were remarkable.
