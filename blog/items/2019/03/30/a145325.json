Then I had a thought, why not turn Twitter into an RSS reader. It's not too many steps. Accept an OPML subscription list. When you add a feed, call \"IFTTT\" and say \"map the output of this feed onto this Twitter account.\" When a feed disappears from the list, delete the IFTTT script. I'm not sure if IFTTT's API will let you do this. OTOH you could probably set up a \"River5\" installation to do it, but it'd be more work. :-)",
