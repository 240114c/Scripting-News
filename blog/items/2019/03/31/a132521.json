Use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku\">Roku</a> over Wi-Fi. Ohhh. Of course I had Roku, and was coming to use it more and more over time. I said what about all the channels I'm paying Spectrum for. Use the Spectrum app on the Roku. I wondered if the quality would be as good as the hard wire coming straight from Spectrum. He said it would be better and said that's how he does it at home. ",
