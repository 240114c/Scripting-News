    "text": "I've been taking pictures of my countryside explorations, and found that my top of the line <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_XS\">iPhone</a> isn't doing a good enough job, so I thought I'd try dusting off the old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_5D\">Canon EOS 5D</a> my father left me, and see what it can do. I went though some of the pictures, the quality is amazing, esp for a camera that's over ten years old. Here's a small bit of a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/02/lafayetteStreet2011.png\">picture</a> I took on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bleecker+St+%26+Lafayette+St,+New+York,+NY+10012/@40.7259294,-73.9968293,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c259855fdd5293:0xd39ec45d9866811e!8m2!3d40.7259294!4d-73.9946406\">Lafayette St</a> in NYC. It does beautiful work. ",
