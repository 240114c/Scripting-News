    "text": "Re classified ads on the web -- if it wasn't Craig Newmark, someone else would have made it work. I had a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/ads/helpWanted.html\">project</a> myself in 1997. eBay was another instance. Amazon has a piece of the business. Yet the press <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/02/blameCraigForNewsDemise.png\">blamed</a> Newmark. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/the-markup-craig-newmark-journalism?verso=true\">They still do</a>. It would be a welcome sign of maturity if today's journalists would stop playing dumb and just drop the idea. As Mazie Hirono said <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/1/18525727/william-barr-testimony-mazie-hirono-senate\">yesterday</a> of Barr's idiocy, we understand what's going on. ",
