Every time I tune in <a href=\"https://www.wamc.org/topic/alan-chartock-message-president\">Alan Chartock</a> is talking. He's their expert on everything, but all he says are platitudes. The first time he got my ire up he said \"Everyone knows that X\" and it pissed me off because X is not true (imho). He likes Joe Biden and Israel. He talks and talks and no one interrupts him, no wonder -- he owns the station (or so it seems).",
