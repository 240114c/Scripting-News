    "text": "New <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=chat\">chat</a> feature. Ted posted a chat message yesterday that I didn't see for many hours. Not good. Disqus used to send me an email message when a new comment is posted. So I added that feature here. I now get an email when a message is posted. So I should be responding more quickly, if I have a response that is. :rocket:",
