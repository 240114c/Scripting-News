We'd go up there <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Flushing,+Queens,+NY/Great+Barrington,+Massachusetts/@41.4865615,-74.1485058,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c260054dc0633f:0xfaec24d1b474281e!2m2!1d-73.833079!2d40.7674987!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e6d20ba5c5f965:0xf17f6f05a00ad904!2m2!1d-73.362008!2d42.1959798!3e0\">via</a> the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taconic_State_Parkway\">Taconic Parkway</a>, and would exit at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_23\">Route 23</a>, and that's where the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@42.2082784,-73.6345615,3a,75y,167.81h,80.2t/am=t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sDu5bvkTav7KMcfXsIjtzWw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DDu5bvkTav7KMcfXsIjtzWw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D45.264877%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656\">Chief Diner</a> is. I bet my brother and I, when we saw <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/martindale-chief-diner-craryville\">the diner</a>, begged our parents to stop. It was the middle of the night (or so it felt to me, then) and they must've been tired. Kids are a pain in the ass. Anyway, I was driving on 23 today and passed the diner, remembered it from childhood, so I stopped and took a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/chiefDiner1.jpg\">couple</a> of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/chiefDiner2.jpg\">pictures</a>.
