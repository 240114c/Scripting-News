    "text": "My <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/024939.html\">mother</a> was in my dreams last night. I remember one part. She's in the other room lying down reading, something she did a lot, and for some reason I called her on the phone. We hadn't spoken in a long time. She said \"an angel is calling\" in a very sentimental way. She never said stuff like that. This morning I wonder maybe I was the one who died? Happy Mother's Day mom, where ever you are, or where ever I am. :heart:",
