    "text": "New feature in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=chat\">chat tab</a>, permalinks. If you roll your mouse over <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/12/permalink.png\">the time</a>, next to the author's name, you'll see it's a link. Click the link to get to a page with just that item on it. It's a permalink to the <a href=\"http://chat.scripting.com/story?day=2019/05/12/&id=136\">story page</a> for the item. That means you can point to a comment the same way you'd point to a blog post. It will continue to work even after there's a rollover of the chat stream (a fresh start that I'll do periodically). However story pages will not survive moderation, so this isn't a place to write a blog post. Respect the <a href=\"http://guidelines.scripting.com/\">comment guidelines</a>. :boom:",
