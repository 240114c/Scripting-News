    "text": "One of my reasons for moving to the country was to have a real kitchen and to re-learn basic cooking. I used to love preparing meals. Last night I hit a milestone. A very simple dish, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/15/dinner.png\">broccoli, carrots</a> -- cooked lightly, then lightly covered in olive oil, soy sauce and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha_sauce\">Sriracha</a>, over rice. Just perfect. Previous iterations were basically edible. Working my way up to a full dinner for guests, maybe by Thanksgiving. But for now I'm happy to be eating well. Living in NYC made it too easy to order delicious food that was too greasy and too much and made me unhappy. ",
