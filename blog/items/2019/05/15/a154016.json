    "text": "Yesterday <a href=\"http://howardweaver.com/styled-12/index.html\">Howard Weaver</a>, a long-time friend, journalist, asked \"What is an open identity server?\" I was able to answer the question <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1128674591201689602\">in a tweet</a>. Briefly it's the part of Twitter that knows you're @howardweaver and I'm @davewiner. I need that in my software too. Rather than build my own, and make users establish a new \"identity\" for my apps, e.g. -- \"little outliner\",  I just use Twitter's. That's the open part.",
