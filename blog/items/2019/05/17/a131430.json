This is so common in cable news, it's the #1 reason I switch channels.",

For each, the number of questions they were asked, the number of times they did and didn't answer the question. A simple way of measuring the integrity of the interviewee. And also the interviewer.

The best ratio, most substance to time talked would be interesting too. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Goldberg\">Michelle Goldberg</a> seems to be the best.
