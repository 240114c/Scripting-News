As we consume the life-sustaining ability of our planet, if we had <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2010/08/29/virgin.jpg\">fewer people</a>, we'd consume it at a slower rate. I don't think there's any great reason to overpopulate the planet, esp when we're so resource-constrained. BTW, I'm a mystic, i.e. I believe in the mystery of it all. :-) ",
