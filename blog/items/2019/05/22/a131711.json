    "text": "Now I think the best season finale ever was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)\">Six Feet Under</a>. The show wasn't pretentious, in fact its point was to make mundane the most dramatic thing that happens to each of us. So the ending was an ending and nothing more. I'm not going to spoil it here. I think there needs to be a site where you can keep your watching history and you can write things like this with enough metadata so it knows not to show it to you if you haven't seen the finale of the show I'm writing about. Maybe in Internet 4.0. ",
