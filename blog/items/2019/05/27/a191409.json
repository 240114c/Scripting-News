And I watched two excellent movies today, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War_(2018_film)\">Cold War</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_(2018_film)\">Roma</a>. It was not part of a plan, I just stumbled on them while browsing on Amazon and Netflix. Both were slow and quiet, very dramatic, and beautiful in every way. Perfect movies. Such an unusual thing! Two in one day? Wow. ",
