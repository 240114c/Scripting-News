    "text": "Over the last few days I've also watched the full second season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_(TV_series)\">Barry</a>, am caught up on Gentleman Jack and Chernobyl, all on HBO.  I know people rave about Barry, but like the second season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve\">Killing Eve</a>, it is a letdown. It's funny that's for sure because Bill Hader is an amazing comedian, like a Jim Carrey or Robin Williams. It's easy to watch, it kills a few hours, but won't give you a lot to think about. It's like popcorn. I think both shows were hurt by running while Game of Thrones was finishing up, btw. It kind of sucked all the air out of the room. Amazingly, now I have absolutely no interest in reading about GoT, where just a week ago, that's pretty much all I wanted to read about. ",
