    "text": "I was intrigued by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jack_(TV_series)\">Gentleman Jack</a> through the first few episodes. The principal character, Anne Lister, played by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suranne_Jones\">Suranne Jones</a>, is very appealing and has an unusual problem, which she sets out to solve, all while leading her remarkable life. I'm not being sarcastic. I was drawn to it because I watched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Foster_(TV_series)\">Doctor Foster</a> which also starred Jones, and it was riveting, and kept my attention through two seasons. But the potential of Gentleman Jack never seems to come together and the show drags and repeats, for what? She's brilliant, but we see before she does that what's she's chasing is unattainable. Or so it seems, the season is only half-done. But the elements of a great show are there so hopefully it's turn around. Episode 5 airs tonight on HBO at 10PM.",
