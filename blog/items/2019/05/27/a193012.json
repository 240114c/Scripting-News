    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)\">Chernobyl</a>, a 5-part miniseries, is something you should watch. It's a really well done thriller about a historic event that I didn't really understand at the time, but I remember how freaked out we all were that it was the end of the world. Now it's easy to watch because we know that it more or less worked out, the world is still here. Episode 4 airs tonight on HBO at 9PM.",
