    "text": "I know the South sucks (it actually doesn't), but one of the things I learned going to college there is that men must show deference to women. If a woman who is a relative or a friend says you should do something, you do it. And you say \"Yes ma'am,\" as a servant would. And mean it. You can say yes ma'am to younger women, even much younger women, and it's still the right thing to say. Being raised in NY all this was new to me as was the first time a girlfriend stood next to a door, and didn't move. It took me a while to figure out that she was waiting for me to open the door. No problem, and she was very gracious when I did it. And I felt both honorable and honored. There's something very sweet and old timey about this. Just thought of it because a woman friend gave me an order, and my response was <i>yes ma'am. </i>Thus this blog post. ;-)",
