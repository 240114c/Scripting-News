    "text": "I just realized that Mueller is like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Clayton_(film)\">Michael Clayton</a>. Specifically, the scene at the end of the movie with Tilda Swinton and George Clooney. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E2z-1Mi6Zo&feature=youtu.be&t=81\">pivotal line</a>: \"I'm not the guy that you kill.\" Translated to Mueller, \"I'm not the guy that testifies.\" He's right. Like Michael Clayton, Mueller is a fixer. He was given a mess to sort out, and he did. Along the way there were indictments. But he did his job. It's now Congress's job. ",
