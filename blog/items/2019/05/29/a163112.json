I still want a nice scripting language for my JavaScript outliner, and it can't be JavaScript.  There's some great food for thought here, and lots of memories. The last time I worked at this level was in the late 80s. Thinking maybe of starting with this syntax for a simple scripting language that can be plugged into JS apps. ",
