You have to put up the barrier as soon as you can, because all the time you wait they become less potent. By the time you realize you should have done it, that you <i>had</i> to do it, given how things have been going, it'll be too late. He'll just have you arrested for being disloyal. Maybe he's already threatening to do that behind the scenes. ",
