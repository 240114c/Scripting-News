    "text": "I signed up for the <a href=\"https://github.com/features/package-registry\">GitHub Package Registry</a> beta, but wasn't selected as one of the lucky few. I do most of my server development these days in Node, and am of course using NPM. Sometimes it gets flaky, and I keep thinking there's more it can do. Am intrigued with the idea of an integrated package manager and GIT repository. If you have any experience wiht the new GHPR beta, write a post <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/119\">somewhere</a> and send me a link. I'm really curious.  ",
