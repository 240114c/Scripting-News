    "text": "The <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/gentleman-jack-season-1-finale-recap-episode-8.html\">season finale</a> of Gentleman Jack was just lovely. Not too perfect, because there are big clouds on the horizon, but a sweet ending. Most people I know didn't see it, but it and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)\">Chernobyl</a>, both from HBO are the highlights of the year. And of course I'm going to binge season 2 of <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/big-little-lies/season-2-everything-you-need-to-know-cast\">Big Little Lies</a>, when it's done, no matter what. Adding Meryl Streep to the already estimable ensemble is too much to miss. ",
