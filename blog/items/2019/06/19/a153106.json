    "text": "I'm glad to see a few #indieweb <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisAldrich/status/1141216395545305088\">people</a> building on OPML. There's a lot you can do with it. For example, the native file format of \"LO2\" is OPML. So it's really good for editing subscription lists for feed readers. And editing blogrolls. My <a href=\"http://storage.littleoutliner.com/users/davewiner/listicles/listicle1.html\">listicle</a> tool takes OPML files as input. And <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/06/18.html#a164307\">River6</a>, coming soon, does a bunch with OPML. There's also \"feedbase\" which will blow your mind if you love sharing subscription lists. Yes there's a lot to discover in OPML-land and more on the way. :boom:",
