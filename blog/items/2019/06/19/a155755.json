I wrote <a href=\"http://scripting.com/opmlHowto/dave/editorOpmlOrg/editSubscriptionLists.html\">one</a> for the OPML Editor in 2008. It still runs btw, I use it, sometimes even to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/19/nbalistinopmleditor.png\">edit</a> subscription lists. Two key bits for LO2: 1.
