Maybe they should do what the <a href=\"https://moversguide.usps.com/mgo/disclaimer\">US Post Office</a> does when you register a change of address. They charge $1 on your credit card. That in turn gets them your real name and address. That's the information they needed, and it's verified to the extent that the credit card company can verify it, and it seems that's also the information that Twitter needs, at least for people. Not so sure about companies. ",
