Breath-taking. My first reaction was \"America is beautiful.\" Not Utah. i thought about that for a bit. Phil had been traveling in Italy and Switzerland, posting pictures of stunningly beautiful places, most of which could not exist in America. because their civilization is older. Of course Utah is a Republican state. Then I thought why doesn't America market itself to Americans. The whole thing, not just pro-this or anti-that. The things that are indivisible. Like the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. That's America, not Republican. ",
