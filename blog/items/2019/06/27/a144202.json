Too many politicians don't find a way to get people to think about themselves. That's key. Because people are always thinking about themselves. Once you get them to feel you're over there on their side, your ideas start clicking with them. They'll think you think like they do. They start to like you. And they start to listen. That's everything. I have to say that was the first time I could say that about Warren. Clearly she wants to win, that's also a big deal. ",

I'm starting to get to the good part, the downfall of Moses. He really fucked NY.
