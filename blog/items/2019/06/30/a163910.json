The book is such a drag, it goes through every project Moses did over thirty years of re-making New York. He was as corrupt as they come. He started out brilliant, with an idea, and was driven to do it almost in an a Jobsian way (<a href=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2017/6/21/15838436/robert-moses-jones-beach-history-new-york-city\">Jones Beach</a> was his Mac).

All the money that could have been spent on efficient mass transit was spent on making roads and bridges that were jammed the day they opened. Classic example the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_495_(New_York)\">Long Island Expressway</a>. It's often bumper to bumper at 2 in the morning. And the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruckner_Interchange\">Bruckner Interchange</a> in the Bronx. Once I calculated that I spent three whole months of my life there, stuck in gridlock on the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Union+St+%26+32nd+Ave,+Queens,+NY+11354/W+Farms+Square+Plaza,+The+Bronx,+NY+10460/@40.8058515,-73.8866668,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2601c5b98533d:0x93bbc40a40f8ae74!2m2!1d-73.8266883!2d40.7689568!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f48cf9f76715:0xeb931b7aca2177eb!2m2!1d-73.880808!2d40.8414408!3e3\">Q44</a> bus.",

Someone should write an abridged version of that book, with a chapter up front saying what a miserly asshole Moses was. Then really dive into the story with the parking lot at Tavern on the Green aka the <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/master-builder-robert-moses-lost-grip-new-york-city-article-1.813426\">Battle of Central Park</a>. I'd guess about 200 pages max. And it could be turned into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men_(film)\">ATPM</a>-like HBO series. Journalists would love the story, it's big story like Watergate, that most people don't know. ",
