They have lots of <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/\">cap space</a>, the profits from giving up on Kristaps Porzingas, which was sad (and it turns out delusional), but it's also power, even if they didn't get KD or Kawhi --  and <i>of course</i> they're <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TommyBeer/status/1145705086871625733\">pissing</a> it away. We need this team to be sold. Please anyone, my friend's cat even, could run this team better. ",
