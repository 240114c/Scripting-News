    "text": "Journalism and jury duty. I agreed strongly with what Emily Bell said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilybell/status/1148298094146129921\">here</a>. Jury duty is a powerful idea, and it works. It's the basis for our justice system. I've written about jury duty many times, in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/02/08/whyShouldYouJoinAJury.html\">2017</a>, <a href=\"http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/whatILearnedFromJuryDuty\">2013</a>, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/29/juryDutyDay2.html\">2008</a>, and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/03/01/juryduty.html\">1996</a>. (The last piece is probably the best, I did it for Wired as well as my blog.)",
