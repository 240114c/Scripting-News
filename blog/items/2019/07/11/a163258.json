Today he showed me a project he's doing at Duke University to create podcasts for their community which is very expansive to include staff and the patients. It's called <a href=\"https://sites.duke.edu/listening/podcast/\">Voices of Duke Health</a>. What an incredible project. They already have 16 episodes. ",
