We know our software sucks. But it's shipping! Next time we'll do better, but even then it will be shitty. The only software that's perfect is one you're dreaming about. Real software crashes, loses data, is hard to learn and hard to use. But it's a process. We'll make it less shitty. Just watch!\" So it occurred to me that the Beatles song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGlo9LzmOME\">Getting Better</a> would be a great song to teach computer science students. Sing it before every class. \"Getting so much better all the time.\"",
