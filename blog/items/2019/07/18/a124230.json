He's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caricature\">caricature</a>, a funny <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqyQfjDScjU\">impersonation</a> of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini\">strong man</a>. People who love him think he's hilarious. Entertaining. I've been saying <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/04/20/1203.html\">this</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/04/28/1224.html\">since</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/09/0815.html\">2016</a>. If you want to counter-program the rallies, which the Democrats, if they had an ounce of ambition, would have done from the start, what you need are old-style standup comedians. Unfortunately the good ones are dead. Joan Rivers (who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN2C6ctpOhg\">liked</a> Trump, she was a real <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-5Q7yuaXjM\">asshole</a>, she didn't just play one on TV) or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qofdWFv7m0U\">Don Rickles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MecU2keW54I\">Rodney Dangerfield</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLODGhEyLvk\">George Carlin</a>. But there must be others. Get <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH_-9hD2xBY\">Bill Hader</a> to do a Joan Rivers impersonation. Or <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/kate-mckinnon-best-celebrity-impressions-on-saturday-night-live\">Kate McKinnon</a>. Then you can leave the <a href=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/\">Democratic nominee</a> to talk about health care, securing the borders, the basic values of America. Let Trump compete with the comedians, which is appropriate because that's what he is. ",
