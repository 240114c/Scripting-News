We ought to pick the most boring and coherent presidential candidate -- the most plain and uncontroversial person on the stage. Nominate him or her, and then get ready to fight. I agree with Friedman, the things they agreed to in the debate were <i>insane. </i>They handed the election to Trump. We need to grab it back. My two picks: Klobuchar or Inslee. ",
