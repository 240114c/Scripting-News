    "text": "I'm doing an interesting project, reviewing all the top-level pages on the \"RSS 2.0\" spec, checking every link to see if it's broken. For those that are, I try to come up with a suitable replacement, usually the archive.org snapshot taken around the time the page was written. If it isn't broken I don't do anything. Here's an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/misc/rss2specbrokenlinks.opml\">OPML file</a> with all the links I've found. Most of the external links are gone, but there are some surprises, sites that have been well-preserved, for example <a href=\"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000967.html\">Jeremy Zawodny's</a>. I just came across a link to the <a href=\"http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://static.userland.com/gems/backend/gratefulDead.xml\">first podcast feed</a>, it's still there. I'm not sure how, but it is. This is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration\">restoration</a> project, started because there was breakage caused by the move to HTTPS on the server. That breakage has been fixed. I also changed the line-endings from carriage-return to linefeed, which now is the almost-universal standard. At the time, 2003, it was still kind of muddy. As a result you can now read the source of the pages in a current browser. The site is a relic. It's a good idea to fix the broken links every 15 years or so. :boom:",
