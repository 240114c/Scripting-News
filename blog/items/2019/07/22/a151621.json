    "text": "I'll probably continue to post notes here as I go along. There were two crucial broken links on the home page of the spec: 1. <a href=\"http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc822.html\">RFC 822</a>, and 2. <a href=\"https://thetwowayweb.com/payloadsforrss\">Payloads for RSS</a>, both of which are integral to the format. I tried to find a <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt\">solid link</a> to the RFC that would stand the test of time. And I discovered that I had copied the Payloads doc, which was originally on a domain that I let go, to <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/payloadsForRss.html\">the RSS site</a>. So I'm going to use that link, instead of an archive.org link.",
