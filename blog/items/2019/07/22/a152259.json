    "text": "This project gives an idea of how important archive.org is going to be to web restorations. Their snapshots are invaluable. Most sites are very temporary things. A great example, I did a project with Jim Moore and Nicco Mele at the Dean campaign in January 2004, an aggregate of a lot of the Dean blogs in RSS format. The Dean campaign was a seminal event in the bootstrap of political blogging. Dean was the first \"Web Candidate,\" certainly not the last. All the websites that the Dean people started are gone today, including the project I did with them, but they're all there on archive.org, so I was able to do a <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/howChannelDeanCameToBe.html\">decent restoration</a> of that project. (Note the updated links are not present on the site yet.)",
