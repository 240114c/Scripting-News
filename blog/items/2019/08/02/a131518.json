    "text": "It'd be interesting to have a <a href=\"http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html\">BloggerCon-style</a> mini-conference on grounds for impeaching Trump, with a note-taker, organizing the ideas into an outline in real-time. I see so many ideas, ones that would force Repubs in the House and Senate to vote against Mom and apple pie. One random idea you never hear in the news -- how about impeaching him for hate crimes, inciting violence against blacks, to begin with. Never mind that it would be a great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_out_the_vote\">GOTV</a> tactic, and also for fund-raising, it would force Repubs to admit they are Nazis. The sooner they decloak, imho, the better. (BTW, I don't think <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/moscow-mitch-mcconnell.html\">Moscow Mitch</a> can table impeachment. The Senate has to actually vote. Key point people overlook.)",
