    "text": "I don't think the NBA works <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/8/1/20749687/carmelo-anthony-comeback-nba\">like this</a>, though emotionally I would hate to see Melo's career end now. Same with Jeremy Lin. I think Melo being a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/02/meloLin.png\">stinker</a> put Lin and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D%27Antoni\">D'Antonio</a> on the road. I'd like to see Melo apologize to Lin, and make a condition of his restitution that his buddy JL has to be included in the deal. Both role players. Melo a bench forward, Lin a bench guard. They work out together and make something new out of their respective talents.  ",
