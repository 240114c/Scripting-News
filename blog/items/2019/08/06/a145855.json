The original <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY\">QWERTY</a> design was optimized to prevent a mechanical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter\">typewriter</a> from jamming. The keyboard on the iPad I typed that tweet on was completely implemented in software. Nothing that can ever get jammed. But the original reason it was designed that way is long forgotten. It's just the way keyboards are done. There have been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin-script_keyboard_layouts\">attempts</a> to change the design, but they proved too unpopular.

I might not be able to control air conditioning or the radio, but I can steer, accelerate, brake, indicate a turn, the same way on every car. It would be chaos if every time you rented a car you'd have to re-learn how to drive. That said, try renting a car in the UK, Jamaica or Japan where everything is on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic#History\">other side</a>. It takes a long time to get used to it, even though at a conscious level the difference is simple to understand. ",

Now it will connect the Hudson and East rivers! You'll be able to use Broadway to get to Brooklyn or New Jersey. We encourage developers to build new tunnels that cross these two wonderful third-party opportunities.\" It doesn't work that way in real cities, but software platforms, managed by Google, Apple or Facebook (examples) often do. Nowadays even <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">open platforms</a> do. Ugh. ",
