    "text": "Apparently the question of an Edit button came up in Twitter corporate presser yesterday. They <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielleDigest/status/1161416013688320006\">said</a> it isn't a high priority. I've often wondered about this. Facebook lets you edit everything you write, and it hasn't seemed to affect the community in any way I can perceive. I use it all the time. Maybe the question is a technical one for Twitter. Perhaps they built their internal server network around the assumption that content can't be modified. Then it might cost a lot of money they don't have to rebuild their server setup. If this were the case I could see why they wouldn't want to disucss it publicly given how little most reporters and users are aware of how the tech works behind the curtain. ",
