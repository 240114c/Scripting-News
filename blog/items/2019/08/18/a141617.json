    "text": "I'm getting ready for my next binge -- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)\">Big Little Lies</a> season 2. I'm looking over the review summaries <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/big-little-lies/season-2\">on Metacritic</a>, and see they're all based on the first three episodes only. This was the same problem with software reviews, back when they did reviews of software (too bad they stopped). They would review the software based on a day's worth of use, if that much. But we design software so that it gets better the more you use it. We balance the tradeoffs. Of course we want the product to be easy to learn, but we also want it to be something you use all the time. It's as ridiculous to judge a serial show based on a third of a season. If I make it through the whole season, which seems likely based on the first season, I'll review the whole thing here on my blog. And I still have to relaunch <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/\">bingeworthy</a> so we accumulate judgements of Scripting News readers on these shows. I have an idea how to do it. :boom:",
