    "text": "As a commercial software developer I had heard about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/08/19/infoworldReviewGuidelines.pdf\">InfoWorld's review guidelines</a>, written in 1994, but had not seen them until yesterday when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harrymccracken\">Harry McCracken</a>, a former member of their review board, posted an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1163143998782881793\">excerpt</a> to Twitter. I asked if I could have a copy of the full manual so I could get them into the archive of my blog, and he kindly provided them. If anyone wants to reboot software reviews this would be a good place to start. In any case it's good to have this <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/08/19/infoworldReviewGuidelines.pdf\">archived</a> for future reference. ",
