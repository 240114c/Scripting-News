He isn't on the Mets anymore, he's with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Seeing his <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/23/flores.png\">picture</a> makes me worry for his mental health. Here was a boy who <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/wilmer-flores-cries-after-learning-hed-been-traded-sta-1720990537\">cried</a> when he thought he was traded. We all <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiIkjt1EF3w\">loved</a> him for that. This is sad.  ",
