I've tried doing my thing in Madison, Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Seattle and New York City. Everywhere I go I get blank stares when I say I create software as an individual. But where do you work? I work for myself. Who do you sell it to? I don't sell it. ",

It's been that way ever since I was in my 20s and left Madison for Silicon Valley to make my fame and fortune. Like a musician goes to Nashville or Memphis, I'd say to my friends. I'm pretty sure they didn't believe me. I got lucky a few times, my products were hits, and I sold them to companies. I've tried being a CEO, and was able to do the job, sort of, but every day when I wake up, I'd rather create something than manage something. I don't like being responsible for other people's careers. So once was enough for being a CEO. It worked, we were able to go public, and the money I made made it possible for me to live a creative life, which is where I am most comfortable, most myself.",

People have a hard time understanding that you could do art with materials such as compilers, servers, editors, networks, display screens, etc. People in general have no idea what those things are but they're no less visible than the raw materials of writing (plot, character, arcs). I'm patient. Not pushing too hard. ",
