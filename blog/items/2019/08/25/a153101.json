    "text": "In a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/08/24/151255.html\">post</a> I wrote yesterday, I referred to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRRsE0LvUqU\">scene</a> in The Shining by embedding it, which worked fine on the web, however when I read the nightly email in Gmail, it had stripped the YouTube embed. I should have at least linked to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRRsE0LvUqU\">the video</a>. Anyway without the video, the writing made absolutely no sense. I've now fixed the post, and if you still want to read it, here's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/08/24/151255.html\">the link</a>. ",
