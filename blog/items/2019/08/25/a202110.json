I have an <a href=\"https://www.e-zpassny.com/en/home/index.shtml\">E-ZPass</a> transponder on my car. This means I can drive on the highways of 18 states and the Canadian province of Ontario. The tolls are charged through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-ZPass\">EZP</a> system. I could drive from NY to Chicago and use it on every toll on the way, or to Florida. Anyway, I think this idea would work really well for paywalls. Collect the money if I decide to read a New Yorker or LA Times piece, even though I have't got a subscription with either, which is analogous of being able to use the toll roads of Georgia even though I'm a resident of New York.",
