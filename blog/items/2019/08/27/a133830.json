I've been <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Occam%27s+News%22+site%3Ascripting.com&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=%22Occam%27s+News%22+site%3Ascripting.com&aqs=chrome..69i57.1303j0j3&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">writing</a> about the concept of Occam's News, a service that only writes about what's obviously true. Doesn't bother with official statements or press releases. We don't interview people on the record. It disclaims up front that <i>does not</i> follow standard journalistic practices. For example, it's obvious that Trump is a Russian oligarch. He meets all the qualifications. So we say that's what he is, in addition to being president of the United States. All our reporting starts with that premise, and reports Russian and American policy as linked. It's news when they deviate. We also assume that climate change is real. It's never subject to question in our reporting. \"Moscow Mitch\" is a popular example of Occam's News philosophy. The guy is owned by Moscow. He doesn't hide it. Etc. So the question for lawyers is what are the legal risks? It's not satire, not meant to be humorous (though of course sometimes the truth is funny). ",
