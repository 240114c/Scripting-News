    "text": "I was looking around for the next project to work on now that the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">Dave-via-email</a> project is done, I hope -- it's the worst kind of software in the world. Talk about small pieces loosely joined. Anyway that's done now, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law\">praise Murphy</a>. I was thinking after reading this <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml\">piece</a> about protocols over platforms, which I could not agree with more, that I have an almost-finished JavaScript implementation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC\">XML-RPC</a>, running on client and server. Since it's my second time through this area, I did it better than last time. It's just a matter of writing docs, testing, and getting other people interested/excited, and most important updating the <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/\">XML-RPC website</a>, which hasn't been touched in many years. Might be just the project for my newly powerful <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/08/28.html\">blog</a>. ",
