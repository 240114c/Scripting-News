My two cents. I would like to see MIT and Harvard people use their prestige to set us on a better course as a society. Most people there are too risk-averse, trying to protect their careers. What a waste. We don't live long enough for that to be a proper motivation imho. That said I'm not so cynical. I have been able to get stuff done personally at Harvard, it's actually a pretty good place to shake things up, if you don't care about getting your position renewed (which I guess I didn't). ",
