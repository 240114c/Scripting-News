Recall I asked about the risks for a news org that disclaimed up front that they were not using journalistic practices, and only reported on what was obviously true. <a href=\"Occam's News site:scripting.com\">Occam's News</a>. As an example the lawyer uses the assumption that Trump is a <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Russian+oligarch%22&t=h_&ia=web\">Russian oligarch</a>, and tries to come up with a reason for us saying that. First Occam's News wouldn't have to say why they know it's true that Trump is a Russian oligarch, but if they did, they might use the equivalent of the mathematical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\">Proof By Contradiction</a>, and start with the assumption that Trump is not a Russian oligarch, and prove that's not possible. It's a perfectly valid way to prove something. Anyway the discussion <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/128#issuecomment-526186621\">continues</a>. ",
