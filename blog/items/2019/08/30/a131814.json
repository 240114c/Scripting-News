    "text": "It's nice to have the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">email feature</a>, because of all the cool people I'm getting back in touch with. This was a good idea. And I'm glad I have control of everything about it, instead of using one of the commercial services. I have my own <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html\">blogging software</a>, and it's way better than the stuff you get from commercial services. Makes sense I should have as much flexibility with the mail feature. I'm still trying to figure out how to integrate the feature in the home page of the blog. I don't want it to be too intrusive, but I also want people to see it because like everyone else I want people to subscribe. ",
