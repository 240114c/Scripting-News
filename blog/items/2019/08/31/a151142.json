    "text": "I've been reading a lot about the <a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/\">MIT Media Lab</a> lately. I read that founder of the lab, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte\">Nicholas Negroponte</a>, made a deal with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Rossetto\">Louis</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Metcalfe\">Jane</a>, the founders of Wired, he bought 10 percent of the magazine for $75K and got a column on the inside back cover, which was prime real estate. This got me thinking. The Media Lab and Wired were made for each other. I loved Wired, but I also was aware that they went for gee-whiz tech over substantial tech more than I wished they would. The Media Lab produced lots of buzzworthy demos that never turned into usable tech. What I really wanted? A Wired/Media Lab that only covered open source tech. It was the style of Wired that attracted me, at the time all tech pubs were made for geeks who were suspicious of anything that looked too slick. I want beautiful artistic simplicity, the kind of look that Wired was so good at, applied to practical almost mundane tech. The developers who love all that stuff are the people I want to work with. Stuff that works and that can change the world right now, looking good, not popcorn-like gee-whiz tech that has limited depth or substance. ",
