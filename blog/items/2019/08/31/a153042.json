    "text": "BTW, for some reason I find <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/\">Wired's</a> paywall particularly <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/egregious\">egregious</a> even though it's no more limiting than other pubs' paywalls. I think it's because I'd like to link to them as much as I link to any other site. I used up my monthly quota just writing the above bit. Wired is a record, like my blog, of where we came from. That its access is limited, while I understand why, is also limiting access to the record. ",
