I was mostly interested in tools that make people better communicators, and that of course includes journalists. Now I make tools that mostly make <i>me</i> a better communicator and a happier writer. If I had one bit of advice to journalism it would be this -- listen better. Journalism is very self-contained. At this time the answers are there, imho, with the readers and with the challenges of technology and authoritarian rulers. We can <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html\">work together</a> to save each other, but that's the key thing we're not doing -- working together. ",
