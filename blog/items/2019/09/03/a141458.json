Yet as they say I never heard about him from reading the news. I think basically he doesn't get reported because news people read only each other, and they aren't writing about him. It's a closed loop. I don't think they mean him harm, it's just their network has a bug. He's definitely worth listening to and learning from. He has good ideas. :boom:",
