One time I was waiting in line at the town pharmacy the tiny woman in front of me was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple\">Shirley Temple</a>. Yesterday after picking up prescriptions at the CVS in Woodstock (I get confused because the name is so similar to Woodside) as I was walking out I saw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lang_(producer)\">Mike Lang</a>, one of the promoters of the Woodstock festival in 1969 (where Joan Baez played, btw). Until I saw the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/woodstock/\">PBS special</a>, I didn't realize what an accomplishment it was, because they did it without enough time or people or money. Of course the moment passed, I'm glad I didn't say anything because everyone should be able to stop in at the pharmacy without meeting strangers who feel they already know them. ",
