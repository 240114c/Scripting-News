I watched most of the game, switching back and forth between it and MSNBC. I started to go to bed after the Mets batted in the ninth, I thought for sure the game was over, merely a formality to get the last three batters out. The Mets <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/game?gameId=401076805\">were ahead</a> 10-4. The home team, the Nationals were defeated, in a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/04/turner.png\">humiliatingly stupid way</a>, not just hitting, ptiching and base-running. Well by the time I got upstairs, with the game on my iPhone, I couldn't believe the score. Runners on second and third, tying run at the plate, one out. I thought well either they win or lose, I'm going to wash up, take my vitamins, brush my teeth, etc. Just as I was grabbing the toothbrush, a <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/video/edwin-diaz-in-play-run-s-to-kurt-suzuki\">walk-off home run</a>. I decided then and there that this was the end of the Mets season. It was a nice run, August was great, but there's no way a team comes back from this. Not even the Mets. ",
