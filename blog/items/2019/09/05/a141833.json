Here's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pierrejoubert73/902cc94d79424356a8d20be2b382e1ab\">how to</a> do it. If you enclose text in an XML &lt;details> element it is collapsable. A &lt;summary> sub-element provides the text that you click to expand. It must not be anything like a standard Markdown element. But it seems to be supported on GitHub. My first impression however is that it's nice, but I probably won't use it. I have the ability to do that here on my blog, and I very rarely make items collapsed by default. I experimented with that here a long time ago. I work in outlines, so this is a natural thing for me to try. But in practice -- not so much. ",
