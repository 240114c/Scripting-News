    "text": "I'm starting to catch up on binge-watching. I saved the whole of season 2 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)\">Big Little Lies</a> to watch in a binge. It was good. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdZTGj3xag0\">Meryl Streep</a>, omg. I won't spoil it, but she plays a character from my neighborhood growing up. Something bad happened in her life, and we'll never know what role she played in it. The story is just as gripping as the previous season, and the acting superb. In other binges, I've started to work on season 2 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)\">Succession</a>, just watched the first episode. I'm going to savor this show. One of the characters reminds me of Jason Calacanis for some reason. Just as the main character of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despicable_Me\">Despicable Me</a>, Gru, reminds me of Mike Arrington, even though he looks nothing like him. But I digress. I still have to do something about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black\">Orange is the New Black</a>. I stopped watching toward the beginning of Season 5. I have no idea how to get back up to speed. Same with the third season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)\">The Handmaid's Tale</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)\">Counterpart</a> -- both of which were very entertaining, but complex. Getting back up to speed in multi-season shows is hard. It might be a good idea to have a digest, maybe in written form, to help you get rebooted in these shows.",
