    "text": "One of the great things about having the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">email service</a> in place is that I'm hearing from friends who are now reading my blog, maybe for the first time. Anyway I heard from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon\">Chris Lydon</a> and <a href=\"https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/03/07/scott-love-the.html\">Scott Love</a> about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/09/08/144021.html\">yesterday's piece</a> about the hero-making of big-dollar academic institutions for the reputational rehabilitation of billionaires. I've collaborated with both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)\">Scott</a> and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html\">Chris</a>, on successful projects, decades apart. They know what can be accomplished with very little money. The money can buy you the illusion of creativity, the actual creativity is invisible to the eye, but is reflected in the product of the work. There's an inverse relationship often between appearances and what comes out the other end of the innovation assembly line. ",
