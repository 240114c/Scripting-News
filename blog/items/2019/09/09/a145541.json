    "text": "BTW, a recent <a href=\"http://radioopensource.org/tarantinos-9th/\">episode</a> of Chris's podcast is about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Hollywood\">Quentin Taratino's latest</a>. I haven't listened to it yet, but I'm glad to discover that Chris is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino\">QT</a> fan, as I am. It's perhaps similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Simpson\">Lisa Simpson</a> being a fan of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Itchy_%26_Scratchy_Show\">Itchy & Scratchy</a>. Why do nice people love violence in video so much? A mystery.",
