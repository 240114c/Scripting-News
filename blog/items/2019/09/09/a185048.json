    "text": "Joi Ito is here to stay on the web. How do I know? Earlier today I was searching for a reference to my longtime friend Scott Love. Scott worked at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext\">Living Videotext</a>, the outliner and presentations company I started in the 80s. He went on to write his own outliner. Joi used it. How do I know? Joi is a blogger. He wrote a <a href=\"https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/03/07/scott-love-the.html\">review</a>, the way bloggers do. He told you how he heard about it, what it was like talking with Scott, and what the product was like. His body of work is there and useful. ",
