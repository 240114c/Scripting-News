    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tone-deaf\">Tone-deaf</a> means something in music, but in politics it's bullshit. There are lots of points of view. Saying something is tone-deaf means you don't agree. Why can't you just say it that way? Why do you have to insult the person? To me it says you're not really confident in your own beliefs. In speech the only thing that's really tone-deaf is saying some else is tone-deaf.",
