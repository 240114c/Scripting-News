That's good. I hope they look into their control of the web. It's even tighter than Microsoft's was in the 90s, which got them into a <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1995/08/22/121895.html?pageNumber=53\">consent decree</a> with the DoJ. Google is doing it with far less visibility, so they're getting away with more. The web is public domain. They appear to have no fear of being stopped, and that's a bad thing. I've written it up in this <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">white paper-like doc</a>. I've been beating this drum because it's so important that we preserve the resource. We'll never be able to rebuild it if they succeed in taking it over the open web. ",
