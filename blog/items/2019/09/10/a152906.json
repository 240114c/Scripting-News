    "text": "Here's a new version of my <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc#readme\">XML-RPC for JavaScript</a>. There's a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc#readme\">client and server</a> for Node, and a client for the browser. A <a href=\"http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcdebugger/\">debugger</a> you can enter a call in, see what goes over the wire and what comes back. If you're using XML-RPC in JavaScript, please consider using this package and <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/9\">give feedback</a>. If you have a current implementation for any environment, please post a note here. In my next pass I plan to make the <a href=\"http://reboot.xmlrpc.com/\">rebooting page</a> into the home page for the XML-RPC <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.com/\">website</a>. ",
