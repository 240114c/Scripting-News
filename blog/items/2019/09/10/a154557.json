It was loud and people moved around between tables. Henry's is not a snazzy joint, which made this event fairly un-Brockman. John Markoff and John Perry Barlow were there, with about 30 others. I hung out with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Parker\">Sean Parker</a>, the future president of Facebook, who had just finished with Napster. I was a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/12/17/whatIfTheRiaaHadEmbracedNapster.html\">big fan</a> of Napster, thought the music industry should have kept it running forever, if they had, they'd own Spotify, basically. Napster proved there was huge potential in networking music. It was inevitable, always, that music would go the way it has.  ",
