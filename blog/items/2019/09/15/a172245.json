Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/twitterComplaint.png\">screen shot</a> of the report. Obviously we were not sharing personal information, just <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/tweetInQuestion.png\">relaying</a> a news report from the <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/13/michael-porter-jr-adam-silver-cell-phone/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dp-sports-nuggets+%28Denver+Post%3A+Sports%3A+Nuggets%29\">Denver Post</a> that some sharing had taken place.
