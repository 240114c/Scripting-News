    "text": "When I was a college student in New Orleans in the 1970s, I used to hang out at restaurants and bars on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Street_(New_Orleans)\">Oak St</a> in Uptown. It's very close to the line separating the city and Jefferson Parish, and like most political lines in the area, it's marked by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee\">levee</a>. If one side floods it doesn't necessarily mean that the other does. It was also very close to the Mississippi River, which of course also has a levee. In this case you walk up the levee, and the river comes to within a few feet of the top, way above the level of the city. If the levee were to break, a huge volume of river water would flood the city. I understood at an intellectual level how precarious this place was. But Oak St was an affluent street in a mostly affluent area. Living there you had the sense that it will always be this way. It seemed impervious to catastrophe. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html\">Thirty years later</a>, after Katrina, I came back and Oak St was destroyed. A fire had raged through the area, unchallenged by fire fighters who were gone. The civilization that seemed so dependable had folded. The people had moved to other cities. New Orleans was almost empty. The point of the story is that climate change may seem theoretical because you live near an Oak St in whatever town you are in. But its stability, the foundation it's built on, is mostly in your imagination. ",
