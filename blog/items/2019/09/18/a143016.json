    "text": "I just bought a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-5/\">new Apple Watch</a>. I wear mine all the time. The reason I got the upgrade? Always-on screen. It's a pain when riding my bike and I want to see what's on the watch, I have to take both hands off the handlebars to get the watch to show me. So I don't do it. I'm getting $100 back for my previous Apple Watch, still in perfect shape. ",
