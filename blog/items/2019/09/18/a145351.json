    "text": "Dave Carlick, marketer, a friend for decades. He did the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=\" cogitank+ergo+sum\"\"=\"\">Cogitank Ergo Sum</a> campaign for us, among others. He also pioneered what he called <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=carlick+\" database+marketing\"\"=\"\">Database Marketing</a>. It's what the whole tech industry is based on now. He went on to do Netscape's first website, then became a VC, and a board member lots of places, but we still hang out like we did in the early 80s. Anyway, Dave was one of the first to subscribe to my blog via <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">nightly email</a>, and the other day he told me an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/09/15.html#a192924\">idea I posted</a> was good. That meant the world to me. For years there has been almost zero feedback to this blog from real-world friends. ",
