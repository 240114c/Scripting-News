    "text": "Some shows I binge in \"savor mode,\" they're so good and there isn't much to binge on, so I go slow, stop often and savor shows to watch later. <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/undone\">Undone</a> is one of those shows. Two 1/2 hour episodes left. It is of a genre, wild misunderstood-as-crazy super-powered young woman, as much a victim of her powers as master of them. Undone is something like <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/russian-doll/season-1\">Russian Doll</a> and <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/killing-eve\">Killing Eve</a>. I'll know more when I finish. But it's one of the best shows ever. ",
