    "text": "I listened to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/podcasts/the-daily/elizabeth-warren-rally.html\">Daily podcast</a> today about what an Elizabeth Warren rally is like. I liked how people were asked to take a minute and introduce themselves to the people around them. Wouldn't it be great if everyone left with a task they would do to make the world better, right now, not after Warren gets elected. This is what we need, meaningful things each of us can do to make things better. We yearn to belong and to do good work.",
