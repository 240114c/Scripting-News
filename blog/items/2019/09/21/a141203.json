    "text": "<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/opinion/republicans-democracy-play-dirty.html\">Fascinating op-ed</a> in the NYT by two political science <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Democracies-Die-Steven-Levitsky/dp/1524762938\">authors</a> about why the Repubs play dirty. They illustrate more generally that political parties play dirty when they realize they can't stay in power any other way. But -- consider this sentence -- \"The only way out of this situation is for the Republican Party to become more diverse.\" As a programmer, which teaches me to challenge my assumptions, it's a critical part of design and debugging, I see that it's <i>not</i> the only way out. Political parties aren't like baseball teams. As long as there's baseball, your favorite team will continue, though they could move or change their name. For example, the Washington Nationals are the former <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals#Montreal_Expos\">Montreal Expos</a>. But the same must not be true of political parties. The Repubs had a good run, but they went down a path that didn't work. So they lose elections. What of it. There's no way the Democrats will rule the whole country unopposed for any amount of time -- a new party will form. In all likelihood two new parties will form. There aren't enough white Christians in the US to rule, and many of them, esp the young ones, see themselves as part of a diverse America. Eventually the Repubs will disappear, the question is how much damage will they do on their way out.",
