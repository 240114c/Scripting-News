He was hired as a product marketing manager at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext\">Living Videotext</a> in the mid-80s, but he was so much more. We went to dinner probably two or three nights a week, and mostly about where to go with our outliner products, and what the competition in the Valley was doing. I would try ideas out on Scott, give him limited background, to see where his mind would go. Very creative and hard-working mind. Scott reads this blog via the nightly email. It's a lot like the old days at <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-chus-los-altos\">Chef Chu's</a> in Los Altos. So Scott, there are features in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/09/21.html#a150505\">web version</a> of Scripting News that aren't in the email version, for security reasons. They also aren't in the RSS version. You can Like any item on the blog, but only in the web browser version. :boom:",
