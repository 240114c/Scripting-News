    "text": "<a href=\"https://dhh.dk/\">DHH</a> wants something like the Scripting News nightly <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">email</a> for people he follows on Twitter. It's doable, the Twitter API has what's needed, but I'm not sure most tweets would look good in email. Think of the hacks people use to tell stories on Twitter. It would be easier the other way around, to take essays and turn them into a series of Tweets. Of course I have an app for that -- \"Little Pork Chop\". There's also \"Happy Friends\", a web app I wrote in 2014. It still works, but I don't use it myself anymore. Not sure why. ",
