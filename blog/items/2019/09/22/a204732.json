    "text": "As usual journalism is cutting Trump too much slack. Here's what actually happened, via <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22occam%27s+news%22+site%3Ascripting.com&t=h_&ia=web\">Occam's News</a>, between Trump and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelensky\">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>, president of Ukraine. First, Trump doesn't care if there's an actual investigation. He wants Zelensky to say there was, and Biden & Biden are being charged with something heinous that carries the death penalty in Ukraine. That's the first round of hype. Then Ukraine files for extradition of the Bidens. Trump goes through a whole drama, trying to decide whether or not to allow Biden & Biden to be deported to Ukraine, or try them in the US, for interfering with an election in a foreign country, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act\">usurping</a> the perogative of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump\">US govt</a>. The press reports on <i>Trump's Decision, </i>Day 1, Day 2 and so on. Reporters camp out in front of the White House all night waiting for a decision. Finally Trump emerges with AG Barr, he decides try them here, showing surprising mercy for the Bidens, it is reported almost everywhere. After all that Ukraine quietly receives the $250 million, of course with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)\">taste</a> for Trump. My guess is that all this will still happen even though it's been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/us/politics/trump-ukraine-biden.html\">exposed</a>. And Pelosi still will not allow impeachment. ",
