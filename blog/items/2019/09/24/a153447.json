    "text": "Yesterday I wrote <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/09/23.html#a150837\">briefly</a> about new social graphs. Here's the background. For a long time, years, to get engagement with smart people on my writing, I had to cross-post to Twitter or Facebook, and at times Medium. This never worked well, there were limits to their APIs or format (character limits on Twitter, for example). Following the Cambridge Analytica mess, Facebook shut down their API so cross-posting was no longer possible. But now, I’m getting engagement, like I did in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/\">early years</a>, on my blog, <i>without going through a silo. </i>This conversation, the one we’re having right now, is part of a new social graph. Nothing long-term about it, it’s already here. Now the question is what's the next step. The email connection works. (To people who are only following in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">RSS feed</a>, I recommend trying the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">nightly email</a>. It feels different. For example, if you reply, I will see it. That doesn't happen in RSS.)",
