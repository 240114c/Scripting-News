    "text": "How permalinks work on Scripting News. There's a simple feature in my blog that makes it easy to point to a specific item. If you look at the end of any post you'll <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/24/purplePoundSign.png\">see four icons</a>. The first, a \"purple pound sign,\" is <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/02/23/designChallengeParagraphlevelPermalinks.html\">a</a> link to the item.
