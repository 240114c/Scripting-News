When I figure something out, here's what comes out of my mouth -- bang. That's a new one. It used to be bing and then ptahhh. Also thank you. Sometimes perfect. Then there was bingo bongo bingo. And now -- bang. Sometimes it's bang bang bang. There's no conscious thought behind these words. It's spontaneous. They just happen. It's as if my subconscious is watching, not entirely sure what's going on, like a black lab hanging out at my feet. He senses something has happened that's momentous and wants to participate. Verbally. ",
