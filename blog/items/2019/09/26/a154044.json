    "text": "I don't see why the Dems went ahead with the public hearing today, given that the whistleblower report <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/26/congress-releases-whistleblower-complaint-alleging-trump-abused-his-office-1514008\">came</a> <a href=\"https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20190812_-_whistleblower_complaint_unclass.pdf\">out</a> before the hearing. The hearing only made sense if the report was being withheld. We're not impeaching the acting DNI. This hearing only made sense of they were stonewalling. They're doing to the whistleblower what Barr did to the Muller Report. They need a showrunner, someone with an outsider's perspective. Schiff, Nadler, Pelosi are lost in the weeds. (Though unlike some, I thought Schiff's intro was brilliant.)",
