    "text": "I can't understand is why more people haven't watched <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=\" bojack+horseman\"+site%3ascripting.com\"=\"\">Bojack Horseman</a>? It's on Netflix so it's pretty easy for a lot of people to get. I hear that people don't like animations. But it's one of the best shows ever, and stars some of the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398228/fullcredits?ref_=ttfc_ql_1\">best actors</a>, and lots of cameos with real Hollywood stars. And many of the people who write and design the show go on to do other shows you probably love. It's very influential. I started spreading the gospel of Bojack in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/whyYouMustWatchBojackHorseman.html\">2015</a>. There's a new 1/2 season coming at the end of October. I can't wait.  ",
