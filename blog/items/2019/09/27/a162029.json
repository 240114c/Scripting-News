Think about what kind of criticism the team would be open to if they did and the season went badly. The management and coaching would take a hit with fans beause they wasted their attention on giving an old player a stage to perform his last season. Kind of makes each game an exhibition, not a serious contest. Might sell a few more tickets, but maybe it'd have the opposite effect, the embarrassment of being Melo rubs off on the team. Even worse, what if they came close, and there's another forward they could have gotten that critics think might have made the difference. Meanwhile Melo was trading jersies with stars on other teams for photo ops. I feel for Melo. I wouldn't want to be where he is. He's more like a mascot than a player. He has a smell on him, and it's not a good one. I wish it weren't so.",
