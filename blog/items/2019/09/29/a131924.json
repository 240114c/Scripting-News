Which I am doing right now. Sounds lovely. The songs are all so great, and form the musical sound track of my whole life all the way back to <a href=\"https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/queens/2125-Ps-32-State-Street/\">elementary school</a>! As I said yesterday, and it bears repeating, that all the Beatles albums are deeply ingrained in who I am. All my early life experiences connected with every other period of my life. I started listening to the Beatles early in life and never stopped. But I only hear the Beatles, I only hear Abbey Road on the new mixes. It doesn't sound any different from other mixes. I wish it did, because I'd love to have more Beatles revelations at my age, which also has significance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCTunqv1Xt4\">in Beatles terms</a>. Heh. But it sounds the same as it always did, full of wonder, like Abbey Road, like the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=beatles+site%3Ascripting.com\">music of my life</a>. ",
