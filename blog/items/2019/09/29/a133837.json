    "text": "I watched the Mets game last night, it was on Fox Sports, so the <a href=\"https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/watch-gary-cohen-keith-hernandez-and-ron-darling-get-emotional-talking-about-1969-mets/308606600\">usual Mets telecasters</a> were sidelined in favor of some total idiots whose names I don't want to know. They didn't bother with the play by play unless <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/09/29/mets-pete-alonso-completely-enjoyed-history-making-moment/\">Pete Alonso</a> was up. At other times they interviewed Mets and Braves players from the dugout. They talked about how nice everyone is, at length. How Alonso must feel now, after hitting the home run, in great detail without any input from Pete, who was on the field at first base, crying. I wondered who likes this style of baseball. I saw him hit the 53rd home run, I was happy for him. But the actual news is that the Mets season is over. And the <i>bad news</i> is that these idiots will be doing the broadcasts for much of the postseason baseball which starts next week. I know this isn't what's wrong with America, but it's a symptom of what's wrong. You're there to call the game, so STFU and do your job.",
