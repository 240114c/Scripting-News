    "text": "Last night's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)\">Succession</a> was awesome (a word I chose deliberately). It has become the latest HBO megahit, following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos\">The Sopranos</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire\">The Wire</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones\">Game of Thrones</a>. Everyone is watching it. And just as \"winter is coming\" became a standard greeting when GoT ruled, we now say Fuck Off with the flair of Logan Roy. We got a taste last night of how well the kids learned from their father, and how they can work together when they are offended in the same way. I suspect they will all, together, be the successor that the show is titled for. But that's not a spoiler, because like you, I have no idea who the winner will be. Now fuck off. :boom:",
