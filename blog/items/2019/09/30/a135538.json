    "text": "Also watched the first episode of season 5 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affair_(TV_series)\">The Affair</a>. I didn't expect it to be good, but someone I met at a Woodstock party recently told me it's the best season yet, so I checked it out, and wow, it is great. I'm going to try to savor this season, slowly, which should be easy given all the great political theater in the real world. ",
