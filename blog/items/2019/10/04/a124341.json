This is what’s wrong with today’s net, that it’s up to one unelected unaccountable tech exec to decide if the elected president has a voice. Twitter has too much power. They endow people they like with millions of followers, and delete accounts for friends. No one has to listen to Trump. I’ve had him blocked for years.",
