    "text": "On the <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl\">Brian Lehrer Show</a> this morning the question came up of why Trump released the \"transcript\" of his talk with the Ukranian president. I have a theory about that which I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1181212175513346049\">tweeted</a> to the show. It goes like this. Trump approved of its release without reading the transcript, or listening to his advisors. They wanted it released because it prevents Trump from throwing them under the bus. It's the new reality of a president who has the attention span of a gnat. Sometimes that works against him more than it works against us. ",
