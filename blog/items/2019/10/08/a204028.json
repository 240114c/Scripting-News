    "text": "A long <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21178885#21179244\">thread</a> on Hacker News about yesterday's anniversary. One commenter said \"I feel bad for Dave. He was so early to the table on so many occasions yet he was left behind and never really made it big monetarily. He is the definition of missing the boat.\" I replied \"Please don't feel bad. I was never trying to make a lot of money from the web. I had lots of opportunities to sell out. I did that once, in the 80s, and that has funded my creative work ever since. Money isn't that useful, I learned, pretty early-on. Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html\">piece</a> I wrote about that recently.\" I'd add that I <i>was</i> disappointed that when the VCs started RSS companies and then podcast companies, they did it with other people, with imho predictably bad results. That was disappointing, but what the hell, no one made any money from those things, and I get to enjoy the podcasts and feeds as much as anyone. And for that I'm grateful. I also wish people like Zuckerberg cared more about the ecosystem, but he and I look at the world differently. ",
