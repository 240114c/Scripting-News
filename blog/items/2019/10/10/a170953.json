    "text": "I had to do a lot of driving today and listened to two Daily podcasts back to back, which should be listened to together, imho. The first was a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/podcasts/the-daily/impeachment-inquiry-democrats-republicans-kavanaugh.html\">profile</a> of the Republican strategist who managed the Kavanaugh confirmation and who is now leading the impeachment defense for Repubs. It was infuriating, esp the way the Times reported it. In the second podcast they <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/podcasts/the-daily/house-democrats-elissa-slotkin.html\">followed</a> one of the pivotal Democratic reps, from Michigan, as she met with constituents at two town halls. The hot topic was impeachment. What was so fascinating is that you can hear, quite clearly, the result of the propoganda from the subject of the first podcast that is <s>informing</s> enraging the anti-impeachment voters. The rep was admirable, made me proud to be an American, a contrast to the first, who made me feel there's no hope for our country. ",
