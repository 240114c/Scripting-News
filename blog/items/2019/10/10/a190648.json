I ask because I found that something I pointed to, and embedded in my blog, that I felt was historic, was on an account that Twitter suspended. The tweet was no longer available. I understand why Twitter needs to suspend accounts, but do they have to get rid of all the previous posts? Does Twitter care about the web? Do they want to be part of it?",
