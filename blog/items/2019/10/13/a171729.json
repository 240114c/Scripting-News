    "text": "Pro tip for podcasters. In your RSS feed, each &lt;item> should set the &lt;link> element to point at the landing page for the episode. Otherwise the only way to share your podcast is with a link to the MP3 which isn't good for you or them. You can see dozens of these items in my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/podc/\">podc</a> account on Twitter. ",
