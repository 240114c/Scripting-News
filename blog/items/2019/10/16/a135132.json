But that's not the same thing as being disempowered. If you say and do things that breed male resentment, they can vote against you, and if you recall Democrats don't do very well with men. There could be a reason. I of course am not one of the men who vote Republican. But I do have to swallow my pride, if I'm going to support Warren, because I know that inside, a place she usually hides, she's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr8-Ln3FK64\">happy</a> to make non-gender issues about men, and throw in a bit of emasculation for good measure.",

Not a bad thing -- having your boundaries expanded in a safe way is a good thing. But that was just five years ago. That's how fresh the idea of same-sex marriage is in the United States. So of course there are a lot of people who are uncomfortable with it. That's an obvious fact. And they're not wrong and they're not just men. Plenty of women feel that way too. I'd love to see some polling data. ",
