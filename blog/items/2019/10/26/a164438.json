    "text": "I had a thought early in the Trump presidency that we should offer him a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Art-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0399594493\">deal</a>. He could have $25 billion cash if he resigns immediately. That number goes down by a billion every month he stays. So he would have a very clear picture of how much the misery of being president was costing him. It would be good for us because it's a small amount of money, all things considered, and if we ever elect a president who would take the deal, we would <i>want</i> them to take the deal. I would say we could start there right now. Pelosi gets together with Moscow Mitch and visits the White House.",
