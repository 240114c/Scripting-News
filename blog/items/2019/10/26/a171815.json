He shouldn't say stuff like that if it's really his intention. More likely he'll be traded in 2 years to Chicago as a backup point guard. People will say, \"Remember Kyrie Irving? He had such a promising carrer. What happened to him?\" He should remember how NY chews up players who think they're bigger than the city. :boom:",
