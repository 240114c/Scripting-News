It feels weird to me, so far from the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Columbus+Cir,+New+York,+NY/@40.7678762,-74.1215993,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258f63c9804b5:0xacca5e3d4112d7eb!8m2!3d40.767848!4d-73.9815219\">center</a> of civilization, I guess there's a bit of pride, but mostly bewilderment. Like the guy who creates a new computer system in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine\">Soul of  a New Machine</a> and sees someone using it and thinks you can't use this stuff. Heh. I don't play much of a role in these things anymore. Not sure I'd want to actually, though I think the software most people use for blogging is nowhere near as good or complete as what we had in the early 00s. Just a little factoring and UI reorg would make things flow much better. Podcasting has become a huge undertaking for people, with seasons and episodes, sponsors.  It should be imho like leaving a voice mail to a few friends. Nice thing is today it can easily scale up to millions of friends. That wasn't true at the beginning. ",
