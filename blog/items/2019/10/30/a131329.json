    "text": "Also in my dreams last night, since I'm on the topic, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Newmark\">Craig Newmark</a> was partying. Dancing, telling jokes, introducing people to other people, being <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=gregarious\">gregarious</a>. I was surprised because this is out of character for him. He's a very nice, considerate person, in real life. But he seems a bit reserved. I find him hard to read. I've known him since the early days of the web in the Bay Area. I defended him when the press took what I felt were unfair <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22craigslist+killer%22&t=h_&ia=web\">shots</a>, taking advantage of the fact that his product had his name in it, blaming him personally for the demise of print news. Ridiculous. So, I was happy to see Craig let go in my dreams. I sometimes say things that might have offended him, but he's never complained. Once I remarked, riding in the back seat of a car with him next to me that it was like being in a car with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Jemima\">Aunt Jemima</a>. I had gotten the idea from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norton\">Peter Norton</a>, who like Craig, had personally become a famous brand. He once said he was the Aunt Jemima of software. I thought that was clever. But of course Craig may not see it the same way. I tend to do that, take risks, I probably offend people from time to time, not meaning to, I assure you. I'm nowhere near as rich as Craig. Maybe that's why? :smile:",
