    "text": "Yesterday I was <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a140306\">saying</a> how weird it is to see podcasts be so pervasive. Here's another example. The NY Post has a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/charles-oakley-sounds-ready-to-re-enter-the-knicks-fold/\">Knicks podcast</a>. I will probably listen, from time to time. Today's podcast is with Charles Oakley, a former Knick and fan favorite, who is <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=charles+oakley+james+dolan&t=h_&ia=web\">hated</a> by James Dolan, which of course makes him even more popular with Knicks fans. He says the Knicks can prove Kevin Durant wrong. Of course they can. The Nets stars need to learn about <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=managing+expectations&t=h_&ia=web\">managing expectations</a>. If the Knicks show up and don't fall apart on the court they will have exceeded the bullshit hype of the Nets stars, both of them great players but probably not in NY after what they've said about the Knicks.
