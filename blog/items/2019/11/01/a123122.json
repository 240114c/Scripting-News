Speier was shot five times and <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/jonestown-murders-jackie-speier-37-years\">left for dead</a>. In a recent debate, when a Repub <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-nunes-compares-house-democrats-impeachment-investigation-to-a-cult-says-media-is-also-a-cult\">blowhard</a> called the impeachment a cult, Speier was righteously <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/468298-congresswoman-who-survived-jonestown-blasts-nunes-for-calling-impeachment\">outraged</a>.

When I hear that, a white male myself, and Jewish, I get a sick feeling in my stomach. How the hell can we get anywhere if we're stuck in this kind of bullshit. I am a first-generation American, my parents and grandparents fled the Nazis, horrific stories, because of something as irrelevant to the quality of a person as being a white man. When I hear \"white men\" accused, I hear them talking about Jews. The same hate, the same impulse to run away. I imagine this is how Speier feels when Republicans accuse Democrats of being a cult.",

Where I generally agree with and support Speier, and think she's a good person, Gaetz is the worst <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/01/gaetzAndTrump.png\">Trump-loving</a> creep imaginable. It's not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing with him, I don't think he believes in anything other than his political career. He's glad to carry water for Trump, no matter what Trump does. ",

He goes on to say (he was prepared for this obviously) that he represents a diverse district and yadda yadda etc etc. But you know what. The miscreant Gaetz was right. Never mind the pragmatism of appealing to white male votes (yes, some of us vote), some things are just right and this is one of them. ",
