Then I saw her mean side, out in the open, on full display. It didn't get her any bad headlines, but I bet every person to whom same-sex marriage is still an uncomfortable idea was totally turned off. What turned me off was how quickly and unfairly she turned it into a male-bashing thing. Presidents aren't allowed to do that. You have to be sensitive. No bashing genders or races. I saw her do it, and watched her face, and I saw something I did not like. And I see it when she speaks now, always. Yes I would vote for her if she were the candidate against Trump, but she would totally lose. ",
