I was sure the Knicks would be blown away. What a surprise to wake up to find out <i><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/ntilikina-gem-in-win-over-porzingis-could-be-knicks-turning-point/\">the Knicks won</a>. </i>I don't think anyone was humiliated, but there's a sadness when you realize how great the team could be now if KP hadn't demanded a trade, had found a way to work with the Knicks.
