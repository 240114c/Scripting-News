    "text": "As a newbie in town, I have basic questions like where to shop for <a href=\"http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1550086702000\">groceries</a>, ride the <a href=\"http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1550336098000\">bike</a>, look at the <a href=\"http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1573313656000\">stars</a>, which <a href=\"http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1551967188000\">airport</a> to fly out of -- really basic stuff.  I usually post the question in the private Facebook group for the town. I keep an <a href=\"http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml?format=opml\">outline</a> of some, not all of the questions and the best advice, <a href=\"http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml\">on this.how</a>. It's for things that aren't blog posts, stories I want to come back to, edit, refine, add to. ",
