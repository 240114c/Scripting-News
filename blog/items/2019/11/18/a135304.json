Blogging integrated with a feed reader. In 2001. It was the product that defined blogging for many, including people who went on to write popular blogging software. And it was where podcasting was born. Radio was both a podcatcher and a tool for managing a podcast feed. It did both sides. I don't know of any product, 18 years later, that does that. And it was easy. We really honed the UI. By then we really understood blogging, and were ready to make it flow. I would put Radio's design up against any popular blogging software today. I think it would win. ",

The thing that made Radio, still to this day a unique product was that the CMS ran on your desktop. A <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html\">fractional horsepower</a> server. It was a repackaging of Frontier. Very few people knew that there was a powerful scripting and object database system running on their machine.

Then all that remains is a remixing to do the integration. ",
