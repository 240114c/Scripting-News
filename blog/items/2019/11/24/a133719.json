    "text": "It's the best time of year for binge-watching. I'm up to date on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot\">Mr Robot</a>. As far as I'm concerned they could stop right here at episode 7. Best season <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Mr+Robot%22&t=h_&ia=web\">yet</a>. But there are still six more episodes in the series. Now I'm working my way through the third season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)\">The Crown</a>. Another tour de force. Waiting in the wings is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)\">Man in the High Castle</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)\">The Morning Show</a>, which is fantastic even though it got <s>awful</s> mixed <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show\">reviews</a>. I only watched the first three episodes, the ones that were released when AppleTV+ came out. I want to wait until the season is done so I can watch it in a binge. I'm not a big fan of waiting a week between episodes. I'm a fairly modal person in most things I do and TV is certainly one of them. I also know a few people who are just now catching up on <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Succession&t=h_&ia=web\">Succession</a>. Can't wait to hear what they think. No spoilers. :boom:",
