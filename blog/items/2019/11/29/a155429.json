    "text": "Updates on bingeing. Couldn't get into the last season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)\">Man in High Castle</a>. Might try again. Instead, I watched a few episodes of the first season of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Larry_Sanders_Show\">Larry Sanders Show</a> on HBO. I had heard it mentioned on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/11/11/778304093/judd-apatow-on-his-mentor-comic-garry-shandling\">Fresh Air</a> a couple of weeks ago, and it was totally worth it. How great is a comedy show that actually both holds your interest and gets you to laugh out loud. Next up: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zen_Diaries_of_Garry_Shandling\">The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling</a>.",
