    "text": "I have no interest in the current <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_superhero_films\">crop</a> of superhero movies, but I would see a movie starring Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/forbes-400-wealth-doubled-last-decade-as-tax-rate-fell-2019-11\">superheroes with their money</a>. They would have to wear outfits and have interesting names and powers. Bezos would be the guy who can get anything delivered to you when you want it. Not sure what Gates' superpower would be.  It would be a lot like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy\">Idiocracy</a>. This movie would anticipate the future of the species when the evolution we're currently going through has run its course. ",
