    "text": "Had a brief talk with <a href=\"http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/12/03/ageism/\">Doc</a> yesterday. He and I of course are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers\">boomers</a>. So is Trump and Rudy G. They were both born a decade before me. Their experience and values are vastly different from mine. There aren't many things you can say about boomers that's true of all boomers except for the period in which we were born (1946-1964) and our parents had sex and a few months later we were born (just like you btw). We come in all sizes and shapes. Some have penises, others have vaginas. Some are black others are white, others are Native American, some are children of Holocaust survivors, and others are Nazis. So many things to say about this, but most importantly the only way we get out of this mess is if we <i>work together. </i>The rest of it is stuff your parents should have taught you. If they're boomers, go ahead and blame them, but don't blame me. I'm not your father. :boom:",
