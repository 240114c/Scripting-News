    "text": "Important to note the role journalism was ready to play in the Trump plot to throw the 2020 election. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/fareed-zakaria-zelensky-vlodymyr-cnn-trump-probe-aff098a1-963f-466b-9572-14f767ebb4e7.html\">Fareed Zakaria</a> of CNN would interview Ukraine president Zelensky, where he would say they were investigating \"The Bidens\" for corruption. From there, Trump would ask repeatedly, as with <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22hillary%27s+emails%22+site%3Ascripting.com&t=hz&ia=web\">Hillary's emails</a> what's the deal, or they're under investigation or his favorite \"I don't know but people are saying.\" That's all that would be needed to keep the \"story\" alive in American journalism. Biden's rep is already tainted. In software we'd consider this a serious vulnerability, and we'd close it asap before our servers were infected again, but journalism just lumbers along oblivious, happy to be used this way. Fake stories don't just enter through the web, Facebook and Twitter, sometimes they enter through the thought-to-be-pure methods of American journalism. ",
