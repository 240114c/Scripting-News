He said he sent an email to himself twenty years in the future and would like to read it. I feel so irresponsible, because when you create a site like that you're pretty much obligated to keep it running. But the contents of the database, if I was any good at backups, is on one of those CDs. I will put the time in at some point to try to restore the app. It should be relatively easy to port to Node. And I can easily export the data out of a root file. I still have \"Frontier\" running on my modern iMac. I use it all the time. ;-)",
