I implemented it and started to set up a test case, and found immediately why this wouldn't work. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/09/macErrorMessage.png\">Mac OS</a>, which I use on my primary machine, uses a . at the beginning of a file name to hide a file or folder. I know I can create such files with a script or at the command line, but the point is to be able to hide stuff from web users that I can see myself. ",

I'm guessing that will work because they had to fit in with both browsers and operating systems, as PagePark does. I'm going to go with that for a bit and see if I'm happy with the way it goes.
