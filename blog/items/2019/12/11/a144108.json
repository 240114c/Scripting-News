I advocate something different, Twitter already has the bugs and scaling issues solved for a global notification network. Let's add a few APIs and create a new universe. It'll happen a lot faster with much better results imho. Interestingly I recorded a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/12/03.html#a151621\">podcast on just this topic</a>, a week ago today. ",
