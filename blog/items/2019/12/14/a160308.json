A big folder with lots of sub-folders, each of which is an app -- containing a <a href=\"https://nodesource.com/blog/the-basics-of-package-json-in-node-js-and-npm/\">package.json</a> file, a node_modules folder, all code, data. You figure out how to host them on servers, I don't care. It works like Dropbox, keeps the folders in sync with the running apps it's managing. I can write dashboards that run on my desktop that keep track of what's going on in the folders. You figure out how much resources I use and I pay for it. ",
