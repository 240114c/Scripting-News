    "text": "We didn't finish <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era\">Reconstruction</a> after the Civil War. I think that's the bug that needs to be fixed. Maybe we need to add a dozen more free states, so we can fix the Senate and Electoral College so long-dead slave owners don't run the country. It's really ridiculous. It's kind of loopy that the first impeachment, of Andrew Johnson, was because he undid Reconstruction, allowing the former slave-owning states to bring back \"slavery lite\" -- aka <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\">Jim Crow</a>.
