See where we put the place to enter a new post? Right in the middle of the top page. The easiest place to get back to. See the menu at the top of the page. It's the same menu on <i>every</i> page. It gets you to the full functionality which included (in 2002) an RSS feed reader. How did we get there? Factoring. Over and over. Until it was logically organized for the person who we were designing it for. Full functionality doesn't have to be a maze for users, if you put the effort in. ",
