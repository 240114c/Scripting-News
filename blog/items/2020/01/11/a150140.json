    "text": "Okay first up is the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/01/10/daveToDoc.m4a\">26-minute podcast</a> that follows Doc's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/01/10.html#a145153\">kickoff</a> of our nascent podcast. You will feel like you're eavesdropping on a conversation between two old friends, which is totally what it is. I remember the first time I met Doc, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck%27s_of_Woodside\">Buck's</a> restaurant in Woodside, CA. I also remember very clearly the day in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/1999/11/15.html\">1999</a> I was at his house in Redwood City, helping him get going with his Manila blog, he was one of the very first, and understood blogging in an instant. Doc looks like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilford_Brimley\">Wilford Brimley</a>. He got the name Doc because he was a radio personality in North Carolina in the 1970s. He has a radio voice. In this voicemail I talk about Fargo, the masterful FX series. I just watched season 2 and am now working my way through season 3. I talk about my development process for the last decade or so. Very different from the previous 30 years. That's just the beginning. It's a content-rich podcast. Hope you listen and enjoy. Looking forward to Doc's rebut.",
