I looked it up, and they are right. And through the rest of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2001/01.html\">January 2001</a>, Adam and I were trying out neat hacks that could move large (for the day) audio and video files back and forth between our offices in California and Europe. Here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/11/payloadsForRss.html\">piece</a> I wrote that day explaining the idea. The site, twowayweb.com, is gone, but the article is preserved in many places, including <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20010202144800/https://thetwowayweb.com/payloadsForRss\">archive.org</a>.
