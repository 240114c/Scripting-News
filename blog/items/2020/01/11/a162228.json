    "text": "It's a fact that XML can be used to serialize complex objects from all kinds of programming languages. I know this because I do it. Have been since 1998. So when a geek says on Twitter that you can't, he or she could get <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1215670988567916546\">pushback</a> from me. Here's a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1215669583425617920\">thread</a> that illustrates. Further, XML and JSON are equivalents as object serializers. I know because I generate both <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rss.json\">JSON</a> and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">XML</a> versions of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216036119931969536\">feed</a> for my blog. And as an experiment, my new XML-RPC implementation can use JSON encoding <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc#using-json-in-place-of-xml\">everywhere</a>, as an option. Of course there are not many servers that can understand this, so sticking with XML for now is the only practical option. I don't have any love for XML, but I do resent having to lose decades of progress for unrigorous technical thinking. I also don't like debating, anywhere, and especially not on Twitter. :rocket:",
