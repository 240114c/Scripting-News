    "text": "One more thing for Doc re \"LO2\". If your outline is something you want to share with me and the other people listening to your podcasts, it's pretty easy. In the File menu choose <i>Get public link. </i>It will <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/15/confirmDialog.png\">confirm</a> that you want to make the outline public. Then a dialog will appear with a link to a page on instantoutliner.com. Copy that link, view it in the browser, send it to whoever you want to share it with. If you send it to me, I'll post it on \"Scripting News\". Now any changes you make in your outline will be reflected immediately for everyone who's watching it. ",
