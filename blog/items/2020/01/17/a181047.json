    "text": "I really liked <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jojo-rabbit\">Jojo Rabbit</a>, even though it got mixed reviews. You start out wondering what the hell they're doing, but in the end it's a good simple little story that has a lot of meaning. A sort of lite version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)\">Handmaid's Tale</a>. I really liked that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Wilson\">Rebel Wilson</a> was in it, a good fit, as was the chief Gestapo guy, and Jojo's best friend. What's not to like? ",
