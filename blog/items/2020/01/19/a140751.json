    "text": "I was corrected yesterday when I used the word exonerate in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1218629254507876354\">tweet</a>. People felt acquit was the correct term for what happens if Trump is absolved (heh another verb) by the Senate. The <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=acquit\">thesaurus</a> thinks they're synonyms btw. Another verb would be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anointing\">annointed</a>, because no doubt a decree will follow from King Trump I (his new title, no sarcasm) requiring everyone to say nice things about him, or their charge cards won't work to buy groceries. See also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System\">social credit</a> an innovation of the Chinese.  ",
