I read a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/22/nyPostOnFairway.png\">story</a> at the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/01/21/fairway-planning-to-file-for-chapter-7-bankruptcy-will-close-all-stores/\">NY Post</a> saying <a href=\"https://www.fairwaymarket.com/\">Fairway</a> is filing for Chapter 7. It's a much-loved grocery chain in NYC. I posted a link <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1142456555961748\">on Facebook</a>, because I know a few people who go there and got a link to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FairwayMarket/status/1219991753752707072\">Twitter post</a> from the company saying they're fine, no plans to shut down. Can't wait to find out what happened here. ",
