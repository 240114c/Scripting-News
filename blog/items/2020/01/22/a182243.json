I explain in this <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/01/22/outliningForThe20s.m4a\">25-minute cast</a> what I'm doing here and why I value the connection with Doc. It's all about creating a groove with smart people so we can keep innovating. We used to call it (as I'm sure Doc remembers) \"users and developers party together.\" I thrive off collaboration with people such as Doc. I provide examples of other times I've benefited from the insights of others to create new uses for networks.  ",
