    "text": "I just did a <a href=\"http://instantoutliner.com/fc\">transition</a> on instantoutliner.com. Complete rewrite of the server from top to bottom. I want to do a bunch of development work here, so I had to have a clean foundation. The previous version was last updated in 2016, so it was using the old technology. If you published an outline in the last few days, I might have lost the link to it. It shouldn't have happened but it did. And thanks again to Doc Searls for helping be the other side of <i>users and developers party together. </i>It's the formula that works.",
