Also coding has not been the limiting factor for a long time. It's how to attract writers and thinkers in all fields. I have a massive body of working code. As I said in the podcast, from this point it's about selecting bits to integrate into the current writing environment. With \"LO2\", people will be using the same blogging environment I use. So we can evolve together. ",

The version of \"Frontier\" that I use as a code-writing and devops tool does not run on the latest Mac OS. We knew this was coming. I bought a super hot iMac Pro just before their OS switch, so I'm good as long as this machine continues to run, and the backup machines I have which are older continue to run. But I'm three hardware failures away from having no way forward. That's not good. ",
