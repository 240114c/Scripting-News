    "text": "Continue to be impressed with Brian Lehrer's Impeachment podcast. Highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/impeachment-daily-podcast/episodes/ben-wittes\">this episode</a> with Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare. I was going to ask Lehrer to do a show on what the US will be like after a Trump acquittal. This episode is a good start. Before watching another hour of CNN or MSNBC, listen to this. You'll learn a lot more. ",
