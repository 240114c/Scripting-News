    "text": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen\">Ben Smith</a>, current editor-in-chief at Buzzfeed News is a good choice to be the new <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/media/ben-smith-buzzfeed-new-york-times.html\">media columnist</a> at the NYT. He has more of a bloggers perspective imho. I like that when he got his hands on the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier\">Steele dossier</a> he shared it with the world. He got in hot water with other professional news people, but why would a reporter feel compelled to keep such a hot news item private? Isn't their job to make important information public? I came to like him listening to this <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/david-remnick-and-ben-smith-discuss-how-the-media-should-cover-the-president\">podcast</a> with David Remnick of the New Yorker.
