I'm angry and frustrated that the NFL won't hire former Niners quarterback <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick\">Colin Kaepernick</a>. I also remember the intellect, wisdom, character, professionalism, talent and luck of the Niners of the 80s and 90s. So just for tonight, I'll be a football fan again. Go Niners! :football:",
