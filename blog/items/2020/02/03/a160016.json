    "text": "Over on Facebook Terry Heaton <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/03/terry.png\">posted a screed</a> in support of Jennifer Lopez in last night's SuperBowl halftime show. To me it was a big meh. I find those kinds of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows#1960s\">shows</a> unimpressive, the music not interesting. I came to watch football, not dance. I'm not kidding. Even Prince, the Stones, Bruce, etc didn't get me off. I was in the kitchen during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrobe_malfunction\">wardrobe malfunction</a>. But -- Terry's post is noteworthy because he ends it with this line: \"America is facing the destruction of our democracy, and we're worried about this?\" We should make a button out of that. Tatoo it on our forehead so we see it in the mirror. We need to be <i>good</i> to each other, find ways to combine our power, not minimize it. Let's go Mets! and thanks for listening. ",
