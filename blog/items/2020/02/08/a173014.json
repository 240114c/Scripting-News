    "text": "BTW, \"LO2\" is just another name for \"Little Outliner\". There was a previous version that was quite different. So when the second version was on the way, I called it LO2. Also because typing <span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.04em\">LITTLE OUTLINER</span> was more work than LO2. Sorry for the confusion.",
