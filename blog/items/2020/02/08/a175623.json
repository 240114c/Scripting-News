    "text": "I turned off the <a href=\"http://likes.scripting.com/\">Likes feature</a> on Scripting News. Most people are reading the stuff through email and RSS.

If it had gained traction I would have been ready to do the work to get it smoothed out. The code is still there, the server is still running, so I could turn it back on any time. ",
