I recorded a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/02/16/DaveGandyVoicemail.m4a\">15-minute voicemailcast</a> to Dave, with a very small slice of my experience with breakage in tech. Dave is now a member of the No Breakage Club. Up until now I thought I was the only one. They learned the hard way by shipping a version of their product that basically broke everyone. It broke me. Squared the complexity of using FA, which ideally would require zero thought, it should \"just work\" as it did when I first adopted it in 2013. Now they're putting the pieces back together, and I'm guessing it will work. It doesn't always, sometimes you're stuck forever supporting both versions. At least if you care about your users. Not sure where this will go, but it's nice to have a friend on the frontier. In the cast I talk about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python#Compatibility\">Python's breakage</a>, it came with v3.0. ",
