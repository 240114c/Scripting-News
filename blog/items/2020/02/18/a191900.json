    "text": "Andrew Shell did a <a href=\"https://blog.andrewshell.org/voicemailcast-20200218/\">voicemailcast</a> about his work with <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewshell/rsscloud-server\">rssCloud</a>, which plugs into RSS 2.0 feeds, and maintains backward compatibility with my implementation which I no longer maintain. He has to do really horrible things to run my software to be sure his stuff still works with it. His philosophy is mine. I really have very little influence on what other people do, sometimes they seem to not listen to prove they don't have to listen, and over time all our work gets erased. But Andrew definitely is a charter member of the soon-to-be-famous No Breakage Club. ",
