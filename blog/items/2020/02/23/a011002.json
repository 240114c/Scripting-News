    "text": "Also I'm not sure <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnandWrites/status/1231622488204959744\">Anand Giridharadas</a> is right. We've been through this before. Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, John Anderson, Barack Obama. All these candidates had Sanders-like pitches. I'm transformative, they said. When I am president, everything will change. Problem is if they actually believe it and are elected, they and we are fucked. They turn out most definitely not to be transformative. The United States is a huge ship and it takes a lot of compromise and time to get it to turn. Giridharadas points out that Sanders is the son of a Holocaust survivor, well, so am I, and I don't like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass\">Hail Mary passes</a> unless that's the only option left. This is not a normal election, and Sanders is way too risky. We need to get solidly off the path we're on, bringing as many people as possible along with us. Then let's go for a Sanders-like candidate, maybe when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC\">AOC</a> is old enough to run for president. ",
