    "text": "Since socialism is going to be a big \"issue\" for the foreseeable future, let me offer two pieces I wrote on the subject. First, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/01/theWorldIsSocialist.html\">The world is socialist</a> in 2011. \"Ayn Rand's philosophy might have worked in an agrarian society when people lived far apart, and couldn't pool their resources. When there wasn't much technology, so there wasn't much point in trying to fight disease or keep the trains running, because there was no medicine or trains.\" And <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/03/08/theWorldIsSocialistPartIi.html\">Health care is socialist</a> in 2017. \"We don't know who will get sick, or when. So rather than take a risk that you'll be the one who gets the expensive disease, we pool our resources to pay a share of what the treatment would cost each year.\" I put \"issue\" in quotes because it isn't a real issue. Everything is socialist, it has to be, there is no other way. So it's redundant to say someone is a socialist. We all are. ",
