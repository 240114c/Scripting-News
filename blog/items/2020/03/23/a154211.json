    "text": "I read in an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/phones-track-spread-covid19-good-idea/\">article</a> about China and South Korea how they relied on location data from people's phones to know where contagious people had been. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/03/20.html#a141448\">NakedJen</a> had to install one of these apps before they'd let her enter the country, just to switch planes. I'm guessing that in the US we can't use that data even though companies like Google, Apple and Facebook have it. The context has changed, and now trillions of dollars are at stake, the existence of our economy, our lives (hope that's not too dramatic). Perhaps it's time to re-think our assumptions. ",
