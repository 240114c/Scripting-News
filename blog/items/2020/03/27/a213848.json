Millions of Americans without health insurance, no savings, no job, sick, homeless, hungry, plus guns. The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/03/21.html#a011845\">ticking time bomb</a> I wrote about briefly on March 21. The so-called stimulus Congress passed, what a joke, does nothing to address this. I would much preferred see the $2 trillion give everyone the health care they need, keep us all fed, and reboot the economy around serving the people of the country. The UK did this, by guaranteeing 80% of people's salaries for the duration. They already have a national health care system. We are headed for a big crash. Congress didn't deal with it. ",
