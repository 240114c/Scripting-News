I had mask-envy. People have such nice store-bought masks. I have some on order from Amazon, but who knows when they'll be here. Just got an email saying oops we're going to be late. Maybe May or June. In the meantime a neighbor made me a beautful denim mask (<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/03/30.html#a143558\">see below</a>) which I will wear proudly when I go to town.",
