    "text": "A couple of months ago it <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/02/08.html#a184531\">started</a> to bug me that I didn't have a DVR for my TV, haven't had one since I gave up my TiVO when I left Massachusetts in 2004. Now my cable setup is Spectrum, because that's the only cable supplier where I live, and their TV package, including HBO, Showtime, and the rest of the stuff. I used it mainly for HBO, MSNBC, Law & Order and the occasional Knicks game. I set out on a quest for an alternative, and the best I came up with is <a href=\"https://tv.youtube.com/\">YouTube TV</a> which I am now subscribed to. The other choice was Hulu, which I have used and liked. Not sure which is better. Anyway, I got my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder\">DVR</a>, so I can watch last night's Maddow when <i>The Trump Show</i> is on in the early evening. And I don't need <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/when-sports-return-from-coronavirus-hiatus-nba-mlb-nhl-2020-3\">sports</a>, because there aren't any. And I use the <a href=\"https://channelstore.roku.com/details/8378/hbo-go\">HBO app</a>, along with Netflix and Amazon. It's a good setup. ",
