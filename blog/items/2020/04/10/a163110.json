    "text": "I chose this route for rolling out rendering for outlines very deliberately because it <i>didn't</i> include blogging features. It's focused on writing. There are already countless ways to blog. But there's a common feature set between the <a href=\"http://this.how/\">this.how</a> docs and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html\">Old School blogs</a>, so any skills you pick up here can work for blogs too, if there's ever a need to go that far. I have found this format useful even though I have a blog. So when you think -- I should write some guidelines for this, or a FAQ or directions for cooking a type of bread, writing that isn't of-the-moment, then you can use \"LO2\" to write and revise it, and send people the URL of the my.this.how rendering of it.
