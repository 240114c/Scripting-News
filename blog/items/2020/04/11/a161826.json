    "text": "I have mixed feelings about our demonstrations for health care workers. It could be interpreted not so much as appreciation as \"please save us.\"  The health care worker might resent this. I would. Why couldn't you heed the warning sooner? But it's good because it's a reminder to ourselves that there will be no simplistic solution to this problem. The applause is for us, for having the resolve and discipline to stick with it. And knowing no matter how painful it is for us, we have it easy.  ",
