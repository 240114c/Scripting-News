I keep trying to get Glitch to put up some resistance, but it doesn't. It really does run Node code, unmodified. When I get it working so quickly I'm dazed and need to retreat a bit and think some more as if I had hit obstacle after obstacle. ",

After reading the config.json file, I had to add a check to see if process.env.PORT was defined, and if so use that port, instead of the default port. That's how Glitch tells you what port to run on, same way Heroku does. I will add that to the PagePark distribution so it'll run without mods.",
