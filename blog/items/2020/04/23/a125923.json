Imagine how happy I was when I discovered the <a href=\"https://psddd.co/free-web-font-people-silhouettes/\">Wee People font</a>. A collection of silhouettes of people gesturing in easily identified ways. I admit I'm making this post extra long so there's room to put one of the images in the right margin. Please forgive me. Now I wonder which one I should use? Let's see. How about a person of indeterminate gender talking on a phone? ",
