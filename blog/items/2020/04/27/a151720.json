I've gotten in the habit of taking my temperature at the beginning and end of every day. I feel like I'm doing my part to support an early warning system. I just noticed they have a way to export your data. I was hoping it would be a nice XML or JSON format, but it's a log file format. Not sorted by anything I can see. I don't have any code that can process this format. But it was there, and that's worth something. I'd give it a B-, but most apps don't give you a way to export your own data, and for that, A+. Also, they should change their store from saying it's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/27/kinsaPreOrderNot.png\">pre-order</a> -- there's nothing <i>pre</i> about it. You can buy it. It takes a few weeks to get there because the product is so popular. ",
