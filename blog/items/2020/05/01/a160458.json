    "text": "NakedJen and her travels from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali\">Bali</a> to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City\">SLC</a> were a big topic on this blog <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/03/\">in March</a>. I spoke with her three times on that trip, in Bali, Seoul and Seattle. She could have stayed in Seoul. There was some question if the flight she had booked to Seattle would actually go. There was a \"last flight\" feeling. It would be a different life if she went one way or the other. She decided to let Delta make the choice. If the plane arrived to take her home, she'd go. If not, she'd stay. She's finally <a href=\"https://www.nakedjen.com/nakedjen/2020/04/we-are-all-in-this-together.html\">written the story</a>. She's an awesome writer. Highly recommended. ",
