He writes frequently about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown\">contact tracing</a>, as he did <a href=\"https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/saturday-2-may-2020\">last night</a>. I believe that our phones can help with contact tracing, and we should be willing to give up some privacy. This is an emergency. I don't agree with Schneier who dismisses the help mobile devices could offer, but some of the comments on <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/05/me_on_covad-19_.html\">his post</a> were right on, imho. More later for sure.",
