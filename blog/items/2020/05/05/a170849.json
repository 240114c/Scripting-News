    "text": "Now that the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/04/30.html#a142426\">Apple is happy</a> with the <a href=\"http://this.how/cuomo/\">Cuomo podcast</a>, it's really nice the way it updates so quickly in the Podcasts app on my iPhone. A few seconds after a new episode is available, the podcast moves to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/05/applePodcastsAppScreenShot.png\">top of the list</a> and it starts downloading the new episode. I wonder how they do it. Is my iPhone polling the feed constantly? Is an Apple  server doing the polling and relaying a notice to all subscribed clients? Or perhaps they hook into the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/06/02/rsscloudDomains.html\">rssCloud</a> functionality that the <a href=\"http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml\">feed</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/05/cloudElement.png\">supports</a> (part of RSS 2.0). That would be the best answer. ",
