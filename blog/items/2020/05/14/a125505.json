For some reason when I linked to this piece <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1260726497532354563\">on Twitter</a>, it got a relatively large number of RTs and Likes. For some reason people found this interesting. I'm trying to link to more local Ulster County news, as more people in the area are tuning into my blog. Something I've been trying to encourage. ",
