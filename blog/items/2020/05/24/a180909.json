The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming_(TV_series)\">second season</a> of <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/homecoming-season-2-review.html\">Homecoming</a> is out, on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085SW2PFQ/?ref=dvm_us_dl_sl_go_ast_522HO|m_2aaNnzkwc_c436988553276&gclid=CjwKCAjwtqj2BRBYEiwAqfzur97nIZDGWdlC1jUutPGDdtug_T52f__inue8ztQOoGDGkQsFlYfKrBoCP3oQAvD_BwE\">Amazon</a>. I started it the other night instead of watching the news. I had forgotten most of the plot of the first season, I remember liking it, but it didn't leave much of an impression. The second season is nicely done, has a Mr Robotish feel, there's a constant stream of twists and surprises, it's fun and so far intellectually gratifying, and it reviews the plot of season 1 as it goes. We have an inkling of how it will end because the first episode is about how it ends, or so we are led to believe. I don't know otherwise because I still have a few episodes to go. But nothing in this show is a straight line, and as I said it's well done. I especially like the end of each episode. They end with a twist, but they stay wtih the scene as the credits roll. I had not seen this technique before. ",
