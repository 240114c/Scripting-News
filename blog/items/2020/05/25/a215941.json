I noted that it's based on a <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/homecoming/episodes\">podcast</a> from Gimlet of the same name. I've started to listen to that. It's also very good. I like the whole thing. I think finally I'm going to have to re-watch Season 1 on Amazon, to complete the experience. ",
