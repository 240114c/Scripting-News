Sometimes people report bugs by submitting <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests\">pull requests</a>. That doesn't work out very well because I write my code in an outliner, and it generates the JavaScript code from the outline. So what you see as source on GitHub actually isn't what I edit. I couldn't accept a pull request to the generated code. It would just be wiped out the next time I made a change to the outline and re-generated. ",
