				<outline text="1. Jury duty is amazing. Especially if you go all the way to a verdict. You learn how the architecture of our democracy places its faith in the people. You might think, if you listened to some of our political leaders, that this would be a bad idea. Because most of us are takers not makers. But it works, because people are a lot smarter, honest and hard-working than we give ourselves credit for. And when you trust people, when you really make that point, and the legal process does that, over and over, &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; comes through. Some people accept trust faster than others, but in the end, all twelve jurors accept their responsibility. When we passed judgement I was sure we had arrived at the correct decision." created="Tue, 18 Sep 2012 12:11:24 GMT" pgfnum="12879">

				<outline text="3. So nothing was actually revealed about Mitt Romney in yesterday's tapes. If you had been watching this guy, like a juror watches every actor in the courtroom, you recognized the pattern. He might have been the guy who runs a company you once worked for. The principal of your school. Your friend's grandfather. To me, he was a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. He was the kind of guy who doesn't know what it means to speak the truth. His existence has nothing to do with the truth. He's a goal-oriented person. He's trying to get something from you. He doesn't care what he has to say to get it. Since he's running for President, a lot of the times that means he's out of his element and you can tell. He's not comfortable with teachers, with working people. But speaking to the rich donors in that dining room, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; his element. He was comfortable. The same way the defendent in our DUI case would have been comfortable in a bar slamming down a few whiskies before going for a drive.

If you had a little faith in it, if 25 percent more people had more faith, it would work a lot better than you have imagined. Because given enough time, no matter how much they lie, we figure it out. Change will come slowly but it will come. But don't tell me it can't change if you haven't even tried. " created="Tue, 18 Sep 2012 12:20:10 GMT" pgfnum="12882"/>

I want to be part of creating new layers of technology. So we can be ever more powerful. I like making money, and have made some -- but for me it's just one priority. And once I had enough money to own my own time, it dropped a lot as a priority. I love what I do, but the financial guys mock my love. I've seen them do it over and over, for decades.

You might think, if you listened to some of our political leaders, that this would be a bad idea. Because most of us are takers not makers. But it works, because people are a lot smarter, honest and hard-working than we give ourselves credit for. And when you trust people, when you really make that point, and the legal process does that, over and over, &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; comes through. Some people accept trust faster than others, but in the end, all twelve jurors accept their responsibility.

If you had been watching this guy, like a juror watches every actor in the courtroom, you recognized the pattern. He might have been the guy who runs a company you once worked for. The principal of your school. Your friend's grandfather. To me, he was a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. He was the kind of guy who doesn't know what it means to speak the truth. His existence has nothing to do with the truth. He's a goal-oriented person. He's trying to get something from you. He doesn't care what he has to say to get it. Since he's running for President, a lot of the times that means he's out of his element and you can tell. He's not comfortable with teachers, with working people. But speaking to the rich donors in that dining room, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; his element. He was comfortable. The same way the defendent in our DUI case would have been comfortable in a bar slamming down a few whiskies before going for a drive.

If you had a little faith in it, if 25 percent more people had more faith, it would work a lot better than you have imagined. Because given enough time, no matter how much they lie, we figure it out.

We're creating a new system for political discourse now. The tools are still early. We can make them much better. But first we have to create the expectation that they will get better, and the places we're looking for change are the places it can't and won't come from. The VCs will never give you the power that I will. The President will never bring about change on his own. But you and I and others like us can.

It couldn't be more dramatic in the context of the election. Because the problem being given to Obama is one he's perfectly suited for. It's the one he wanted when he arrived in Washington in 2009 and thought he had been given, in the economic collapse. Unfortunately for all of us, the Republicans responded very negatively to Obama (understatement). This was made very clear in the Frontline report (see #1). I hadn't understood how the Republicans despised him. It wasn't just expedient. They actually hated him. I didn't get this because I didn't feel that way about Obama. But I certainly have felt that way about other politicians. " created="Wed, 31 Oct 2012 02:48:28 GMT" pgfnum="14938">

He gets to throw a Hail Mary pass, with almost no political cost, certainly none before the election. (I'd love to see Romney complain that Obama was spending too much on New Jersey, esp with the pictures on CNN likely to come in the days ahead. This isn't Benghazi or even Katrina.

If this crisis, exactly this crisis, happened in February and Romney was President, he'd be Christie's buddy too, with the checkbook open ready to fill in whatever number Chris asks him to.

				<outline text="It is." created="Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:33:58 GMT" pgfnum="14645"/>
				<outline text="The way people read on the Internet usually has nothing to do with listening. What people seem to do mostly is skim the article looking for their own name, the name of someone they hate, or if neither of those turn up, they look for a key word or phrase that's linked to one of their canned schpiels. There are some notorious commenters here, people who make me groan when I see their names. I know what I'm going to hear has nothing to do with the topic of the piece. In the worst cases they just pick up a rant almost verbatim from The Ed Show or O'Reilly, and repeat it word for word. Nothing could be more boring.

				<outline text="How you can tell if you're not listening? Here are some clues:" created="Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:36:27 GMT" pgfnum="14647"/>
				<outline text="1. The person you think you're listening to tells you that you're not. They might be wrong, but before you dismiss them out of hand, consider the possibility that they're right. And use the scientific method. Read the actual words they have written. Not the story you hear in your own head when you read those words. Read &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; words. " created="Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:36:46 GMT" pgfnum="14648"/>
				<outline text="2. If you find yourself hearing someone familiar talking through them, you're not listening. For example, if the thought forms in your head that &quot;he is just like my brother&quot; or mother or father, or former best friend -- someone you have issues with -- then you're not listening. There's absolutlely no doubt. Classic clue that you're projecting. Instead take a deep breath, look at your surroundings, then look back at the screen. It's just a screen. Not the family kitchen table when you were growing up. Your abusive parent isn't berating you. It's just some bits on a screen. :-)" created="Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:36:56 GMT" pgfnum="14649"/>
				<outline text="3. Try this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/03/03/DonsAmazingPuzzle.html&quot;&gt;puzzle&lt;/a&gt;. Most people don't get the right answer. I didn't. I was amazed. That's another proof that listening is hard. If you can't count the letters, what are the chances that you've actually heard what someone is saying by skimming their story on the net." created="Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:40:47 GMT" pgfnum="14650"/>

					</outline>
				<outline text="5. A famous editor hated me for a long time, but then all of a sudden one day started being nice to me. This kept going on long enough that we've now had a discussion about why he hated me so much. It's the old inference thing. I was saying &quot;Sources Go Direct.&quot; I wasn't saying that I &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; sources to go direct, or that editors deserved to be routed around (although as a matter of fact I did, and mostly do). But that wasn't what I was saying. I was saying that if you're in the publishing business, in any way, you have to realize that the lower cost of production and distribution has radically changed the way things work. You must factor that in. Hating me won't change anything. And if you actually listen to what I'm saying (there's the rub again) I say over and over that I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; professional journalists to make the transition. But you can't make the transition by clinging to a system that has gone away." created="Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:42:16 GMT" pgfnum="14652"/>
				<outline text="6. Another clue is that the topic is something that you find repulsive. Most people can't listen to topics that disgust them. For example, if I say that the OWS people missed huge opportunities because they didn't listen, if you support OWS, you're going to likely respond with a story that's orthogonal. I know this because it happens every time. But isn't it better to hear about the missed opportunity, esp when it's not too late, because then you don't have to miss it? To me, this is like a programmer who argues with a bug report. Why? If you listen, you can fix it. Good programmers do not argue with bug reports. And good revolutionaries are always looking for ways to be more effective at revolution. Dilbert-like revolutionaries insist on telling you why you don't get it. Don't be a Dilbert-like revolutionary. Nothing is more pathetic." created="Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:44:58 GMT" pgfnum="14653"/>

It could at least serve as a sandbox for testing apps before they go live. And it might turn into a coral reef.

It seems perfectly reasonable that Google Reader could adapt to make sense out of these feeds. It's just one piece of software. But they don't move, and that gives others a tough choice.

				<outline text="I listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/75&quot;&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; between Evan Williams and Jeffrey Zeldman yesterday. It had a few bits about &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, which is his new startup. I am interested in know what his thinking is on this -- as we've been exploring the same territory for a number of years, and his ideas are always worth a listen." created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:14:24 GMT" pgfnum="15606"/>
				<outline text="Here's the executive summary -- he is exploring a niche that exists. Sometimes you wonder what a designer is thinking, that they're exploring something that no one wants, but not in this case. People will want what Medium does.

				<outline text="1. It's a hybrid, at the intersection of blogging systems and commenting systems. " created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:17:03 GMT" pgfnum="15609"/>
				<outline text="2. You don't have to create a blog. This can be a huge barrier for some people. People who have something to say but view creating a blog as making a commitment. Technically they're not right about this. Creating a new blog is no more complex than creating a new word processing document. But there's a psychic overhead that stops a lot of people. I know this because I've been evangelizing blogs for many years. A lot of people feel this commitment and it stops them from contributing." created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:17:34 GMT" pgfnum="15610"/>
				<outline text="3. Like Twitter, this product is a simplification of what came before, a narrowing, and a focusing, but it's still wide open. Zeldman kind of got tripped up by this, but Williams was very clear. Users can create new buckets or collections and call them anything they want. A bucket is analogous to a blog post. Then other people can post to it. That's like a comment. But it doesn't look like a comment. It's got a place for a big image at the top. It looks much prettier than a comment, and much bigger. Looks are important here. " created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:19:03 GMT" pgfnum="15611"/>
				<outline text="4. There's no way for a user to control CSS or provide a template, or even choose a template from a library. This would make the product more complex. Not sure what their plans are here, but whether they offer these features will play a big role in defining the service." created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:20:50 GMT" pgfnum="15612"/>
				<outline text="5. It's closest to Tumblr right now -- another product that occupies the space between full-blown blogging like WordPress, and ultra lightweight blogging in Twitter. Clearly Twitter is moving more towards Tumblr. If Medium adds templates and CSS they will be aimed squarely at Tumblr. " created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:21:45 GMT" pgfnum="15613"/>

Also not clear is how much portability users will have. At this point they offer beta users a way to download the contents of their site. This doesn't make it possible to use it as an editorial system for other environments, or the other way around, to use other tools to author content for Medium. There's no doubt Ev understands the opportunities here. Blogger had a pretty complete API as did Twitter. But in Twitter, everyone got burned by the API, including the company (though to a much lesser extent than developers) so my guess is that Ev's new company will be more conservative about interfaces than his previous ventures." created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:22:56 GMT" pgfnum="15614"/>
				<outline text="7. The editor has some nice touches. The biggest one being that the rendering styles apply in when you're editing, so it delivers a level of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG&quot;&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/a&gt; that previously I had not seen in browser-based editors. This will be a highly valued feature. This is the sizzle of Medium, along with the very easy to read template they use. " created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:24:58 GMT" pgfnum="15615"/>
				<outline text="8. The more I understand about Medium, the more trouble I have seeing how it co-exists with another Williams startup, Branch. It seems like they're both camped out in the same space betw blogging and Twitter. That as the two products evolve they will keep colliding with each other. " created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:26:19 GMT" pgfnum="15616"/>
				<outline text="9. They just hired a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/about/4459985d253a&quot;&gt;Director of Content&lt;/a&gt;, a former agent in the book publishing industry. Very curious. I guess that means famous authors will submit chapters from upcoming books and allow regular folk to attach our own writing to this stuff. Analogous to getting Oprah on Twitter? That could give Medium a very short honeymoon with the early adopters that make these kinds of services grow. " created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:27:05 GMT" pgfnum="15617"/>
				<outline text="10. This is yet another company that compensates its employees without compensating the content creators. Although clearly there is a class of creators who may receive compensation (see the previous point). Personal comment -- this makes me reluctant to participate. I appreciate getting early access, and I have posted a few items to the service to better understand how it works. But without a fair balance between the valuation of all of our contributions, I can't continue, or recommend that others contribute. I've always been on the outside of Ev's creations, putting creativity in while he and others take the dollars out. It's fun for a while, but then it gets old. The Internet and the web weren't designed this way, and I keep waiting for one of these services to build something that doesn't have this very tilted posture. That would be harder, but much more significant. " created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:32:33 GMT" pgfnum="15618"/>
				<outline text="11. Maybe the biggest point he makes in the podcast is his view that Medium should be seen as if it were YouTube for writing. We all understand what YouTube is. Is YouTube-for-Writing a niche? Not sure. Video obviously has special needs regarding bandwidth. And those issues don't exist for text. But aggregating them all in one spot has advantages. But it's possible to do that without capturing all of it one company's servers." created="Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:36:50 GMT" pgfnum="15619"/>

If you're in a strange city and would like to go to the movies with someone with similar tastes, just click a few buttons. They were gathering all this information about people's movie preferences.

					<outline text="1. Don't write mini-essays in Twitter. Instead fully express your idea on your blog and post a link to Twitter. That's the single most constructive thing people can do. "/>

If you absolutely can't respond in a post, then respond in a comment. 140 character posts are very often impossible to parse. And are hard to respond to if my answer requires more than 140. That's why I don't do support on Twitter. I think it's impossible. And tweets have limited utility after they scroll off. Comments create a somewhat better record. And instead of concentrating everything on one company's servers, we can spread them around a little." collapse="true">
						<outline text="That said, don't see this rule as requiring you to be long-winded. You still want to get to the point quickly so people read what you're saying. People are very busy these days, so you want to say what you have to say as quickly as possible. And if you have a blogging tool that supports collapsable text like mine, use it to add detail in a way that's optional for the reader. " created="Tue, 20 Nov 2012 14:29:49 GMT" pgfnum="15558"/>

					<outline text="3. For the installed leaders -- run a river of the blogs you read, and share it with your readers. Link to it prominently from your home page. Talk about it in posts. Get people to read more than just your blog. " collapse="true">

					<outline text="5. Don't wait for a press release to write about something that's new. I find it amazing sometimes all the new stuff I've shipped on Scripting News, whci now is a fairly radical-looking blog with at least a few never-seen-before features, yet, as far as I know -- no one has written about them.

The great &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Nisker&quot;&gt;Scoop Nisker&lt;/a&gt; said -- If you don't like the news, go out and make some of your own.

					<outline text="3. Plan B was that user/bloggers would review the companies' products, and we'd at least get non-bullshit product news that way. That worked for a while, then people started using Twitter, and have been reduced to 140-character grunts and snorts. You can tell a little truth in 140-character chunks. Very little ones. Nothing factually interesting. For that you need a little elbow room. If that's really going to happen, more people have to write blog posts.

But there isn't enough to read to cover most of what I'm interested in, and also the stuff I don't know I'm interested in. If we could do more networking on a more regular and systematic basis, that would create incentives for more people to do it, and would build flow independent of Twitter. But blogs work like everything else. Installed leaders don't generally help upstarts. Might impact the bottom-line. Go back to the sharks analogy. It takes some big thinking and betting to see that we're going to starve outside Twitter soon, and we'd all do better if we invest in each other and in opening doors for newcomers.

			<outline text="This is not Steve's Apple" created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 18:01:37 GMT" name="steveWouldntHaveShippedTheIpadMini" pgfnum="15335" type="thread">
				<outline text="First, I have been an Apple shareholder for about 10 years. I haven't sold my stock, yet -- but for the first time I'm thinking about it. I'm worried that I'll decide to sell after it's too late. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:37:39 GMT" pgfnum="15336"/>
				<outline text="Anyway -- here's the thing. I bought an iPad Mini. It was too cheap not to give in to curiosity, to see if it's more compelling or useful or whatever, than the high-end iPad that I already have. Executive summary: It is not." created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:38:26 GMT" pgfnum="15337"/>
				<outline text="Here's the list of problems." created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:39:23 GMT" pgfnum="15338"/>
				<outline text="1. I already had a great iPad. It's big and heavy, and hurts my arm to read in bed. It's my primary bed computer, and also the second screen when I'm watching TV. When I read in bed it leaves impressions on my arm where it rests. I can't imagine this is good for the circulation in my arm. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:39:34 GMT" pgfnum="15339"/>
				<outline text="2. I could use the iPad Mini, but I don't. People say they don't mind the grainier screen, but I do. If I have a choice, and I do, I always pick up the bigger iPad with the easy-to-read high resolution screen." created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:40:25 GMT" pgfnum="15340"/>
				<outline text="3. What about as a traveling computer? Well, there too I go for the larger iPad, because it has LTE. It's very functional, in my knapsack, when I go out. I swtich it over from wifi to LTE when I go out. And I turn on Bluetooth, so that my iPod (blue, 32GB) has a way to get on the net. The iPad Mini could be a replacement for the iPod, I suppose. But it doesn't fit in the pocket as well. (However it does fit in my pocket, which is cool. Maybe I should try replacing the iPod with the Mini.)" created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:40:57 GMT" pgfnum="15341"/>
				<outline text="4. But here's the verdict, the reason why I think this product is making Apple's stock dive. Steve never would have shipped it. I know people have been saying that about all kinds of things ever since he died. Steve wouldn't have done this or that. I've stayed away from saying that -- even though the thought has popped into my head -- because I've never felt certain, and I don't think it's fair to say something like that unless you really feel it in your gut. But this one is kind of obvious. Technology has to keep getting better. Once you've shipped an iPad with a super high-resolution &quot;retina&quot; display, you can't ask people to buy a new one that doesn't have it. Steve wouldn't have done it. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:42:35 GMT" pgfnum="15342"/>
				<outline text="5. Some features are just features, like a camera, but the resolution of a display isn't a feature. It's integral to the product. It's like trying to sell a car with a fuzzy windshield. Everything you do with the Mini is a reminder that you could be using a nicer product. Always having the nicest thing is what Steve's Apple stood for. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:59:23 GMT" pgfnum="15344"/>
				<outline text="6. The new Apple is willing to compromise. And what are they compromising for? Well, it looks like they're doing it so they can &quot;compete&quot; with Google and Amazon. But again -- Steve's Apple never deigned to do something as crass as &quot;competing.&quot; It was a foreign concept. Steve's Apple was so far in advance of everyone else, it was ridiculous to think of them as competition. But here is the new Apple inviting comparison to something else. But the comparison that's inevitable and damning, is the comparison between the Mini and its predecessor, the iPad 3. And in that comparison the newer product is a dust-catcher. Its battery is always fully charged. It never gets off the night table. It was an obsolete product the day it shipped, and the day &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it shipped. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:59:51 GMT" pgfnum="15345"/>
				<outline text="BTW, this is why the orchestrated reviews of products are often worthless. I invite Mossberg, Pogue or Gruber to re-review their iPad Mini now, a week after their initial reviews, and let us know if they're actually using it. And if they still think it's a winner. I believe it's not only not a winner, but it signals a new Apple that's no longer beyond compare, no longer insisting on delighting its users to the point of orgasm. This Apple is content to be a competitor. Not my idea of what Apple is, and definitely not Steve's. " created="Sat, 10 Nov 2012 17:48:33 GMT" pgfnum="15343"/>

I assume Republican strategists figured that while maybe it would be an issue in Missouri, the rest of us would forget about it. We didn't. And then it happened again in Indiana. This time the Republican leadership didn't say anything. What if, instead, Romney had made a big deal about it, like the Obama race speech in 2008. Cut support for Akin, on principle. That would have changed the tone of the campaign. But this isn't the kind of thing a Romney does. And that's a big part of why he isn't President-elect Romney. He isn't willing to take a risk for a big reward. He's a numbers guy. Not a good guy to be Leader of the Free World.

If he hadn't shared the 47 percent bit, that might have made a difference. There was a moment in the first debate when a thought popped into my head that he's the real president.

I appreciate that he uses statistical methods, and I understand what you can and cannot do with stats. It's possible that Romney will win when there's an 80 percent chance of Obama winning. But, according to Nate's model, four times out of five, Obama wins. He's not 100 percent sure of it. But he's sure enough to put his honor on the line. As a believer in Nate, and a supporter of Obama, I am relieved. But -- if Nate said it was the other way around, 80 percent likely that Romney would win, I wouldn't even think of trying to discredit Nate. Instead, I'd be depressed about the future of the world.

Amateur means it's done for love, not money. Good blogging &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; amateur. But then so is good everything, pretty much. I don't really care how much money you made writing that book or movie script. I care about what it evoked for me, what you said, what it proved. On those grounds Nate Silver certainly belongs in the BOTY seat for this year. He proved that an individual with his brain and beliefs can conquer all the paid pundits the pros can muster. Politically and spiritually Nate is a carrier of The Cause. Believe your eyes and ears, and your mind, not conventional wisdom. But in the end, I believe his accomplishments in 2012 were not about his blogging. The blogging was a means to a different end.

One morning I decided to take my swim via car. I drove a couple of miles south, on a stretch of beach that was totally empty. I laid out the towel, read for a while, then went for my swim. When I came back, there was another car parked next to mine.

				<outline text="The last week I've been helping my very good friend NakedJen get started in the world of smartphones. Until now she had a Blackberry that could do SMS, but had email disabled. I don't really understand why, but it's not important to the story. She was hard to reach via email, and she couldn't use any of the apps we all like to use. She didn't have maps or any of the other cool stuff we're all playing with these days." created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:38:42 GMT" pgfnum="15842"/>
				<outline text="Once I understood where she was, I gave her a phone I wasn't using, one of the first Google Nexus phones. It was a gift from Google. So it was totally appropriate that I pass it on to NakedJen. " created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:40:42 GMT" pgfnum="15843"/>
				<outline text="I think she stayed up all night playing with the phone. When I checked in with her, she had done all kinds of customizations. The next day she was installing apps. She was giggling with glee at every revelation. I think she saw that this mode of computer use is actually pretty simple. And she's taking it back with her to Salt Lake City, where her family there will be very happy I'm sure that Jen will be part of the 21st Century (something I like to kid her about)." created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:41:42 GMT" pgfnum="15844"/>
				<outline text="Next part of the story. This morning I got a Fedex from a longtime friend at Microsoft. In the package there were two new smartphones, a Nokia 920 and 810. Since I am a T-Mobile guy, I started with the 810. It's a lovely piece of tech. The performance and color are amazing. It's also very easy to guess where everything is. I had it set up to work over wifi with my GMail account in about five minutes. A few minutes later I was taking pictures and had installed the Twitter app. I sent a text message. Then we went out for a walk. I took my iPod Touch, iPad LTE and Nexus 4 with me, in addition to the 810, and of course NakedJen and her Android phone. It all worked just fine. Everything that didn't have its own service plan connected to the net via Bluetooth through the iPad. " created="Wed, 12 Dec 2012 22:43:38 GMT" pgfnum="15845"/>

I can't even figure out how to send an SMS without someone sending me one first. I tried reading all of Google's docs, installed all the software they told me to install, and in the end I went back to the Nexus 4 to communicate with Jen. Later I realized I could do what I needed to with the Voice website. But there were problems there too. I ended up having to enter the number manually, my contacts list was useless in that context.

				<outline text="I get a fair amount of grief for writing my blog and pushing links through my feed and to Twitter. It's been this way since before I started blogging. There are always people around who question your motives, and who project their own nasty theories about people on the easiest target to find. Often that's the most vocal and visible person, esp one without affiliation. There always seems to be one person who has a bone to pick with me, sometimes &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of people. " created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:32:46 GMT" pgfnum="17317"/>
				<outline text="There are many reasons I write, but probably the least of it is for fame or fortune. I don't make much money writing, I actually &lt;i&gt;spend&lt;/i&gt; money to write. And if I wanted fame there are much more direct ways to go about it. In fact over the years, I've done things to limit my fame, because I don't like being famous. " created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:34:53 GMT" pgfnum="17318"/>
				<outline text="I write to express myself, and to learn. Writing is a form of processing my ideas. When I tell a story verbally a few times, I'm ready to write it. After writing it, I understand the subject even better." created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:36:09 GMT" pgfnum="17319"/>
				<outline text="I send links to Twitter and to my linkblog feed because I want to share them, and because I want to remember them. By linking to them they get into my archive where I can search. This way instead of hunting around for an article, trying to remember where it was or how I got there, instead I just scroll through the archive. As a by-product, I share it. Some people like this. I assume the people who don't like it know how to unsub." created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:36:55 GMT" pgfnum="17320"/>
				<outline text="I also write to create a record. In my programming work I've gotten a lot more disciplined about this. I have a rule that I can't make a change to my most mature products, the ones that are being used by others, without posting a worknote. It's a rule I don't have any trouble keeping, even though at the beginning, it was like a New Years resolution, it felt like a chore. Now it's a habit as ingrained as brushing my teeth or taking my meds or getting exercise every day. I don't feel right if I don't do it -- so I do." created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:38:14 GMT" pgfnum="17321"/>
				<outline text="I write to keep up the connection with people I care about. That way when we meet, they have a clue what's going on with me. I really like it when people I care about blog too, so its reciprocal." created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:39:59 GMT" pgfnum="17322"/>
				<outline text="I write to put a stake in the ground, so I can, over time, debug my prediction process, and hone my understanding of how things work. If you point to something I wrote ten years ago that turned out wrong, I don't feel ashamed. I take the opportunity to learn. By explaining my process then, I have a chance to debug it later. Why did I think desktop publishing was a bad idea? I don't know -- because I didn't write about it. But I do know why I thought the iPhone was a bad idea. This process helps me get smarter over time. " created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:40:29 GMT" pgfnum="17323"/>
				<outline text="I write to give people something to react to. So you think the iPhone was a winner from Day One. Great. Tell me why. Maybe I'll change my mind. It's happened more than once that a commenter here showed me another way of thinking about something and I eventually came around to their point of view. And even if I don't change my mind, it's helpful to understand how another person, given the same set of facts, can arrive at a different conclusion. " created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:42:08 GMT" pgfnum="17324"/>
				<outline text="Update: Another reason I write, which I remembered after publishing -- I develop writing tools. If I didn't write, I couldn't do that. I wouldn't be able to test them, refine them, and get new ideas for new tools. Writing and my software development process are integral. I couldn't do one without the other." created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 15:32:01 GMT" pgfnum="17345"/>
				<outline text="And maybe I write because I'm narcissistic. It's possible. You know it's hard to tell, because the only experience we have is our own. I don't know what you think, unless you tell me, and then I have to decide if you're being honest about it, or being honest with yourself. And I try not to worry about that so much. Because whether you're honest or not is something for you to deal with, and if there is a god, for he or she to judge you on. It's not my problem, thankfully. Because there are now 7 billion people on the planet. If we were to make each person's honesty our business, we'd have no time to live! :-)" created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:43:28 GMT" pgfnum="17325"/>
				<outline text="So when someone gets on a soapbox and starts trying to rev up a crowd to hate me, and when they lie to do it, I have to learn not to give that any weight. What I do now is ask a friend to have a look and tell me what they see. Since the ranting isn't about them, they won't take it personally. If they say it's something I should pay attention to, I would -- but they never do. The most recent time it happened, a friend came back and said the person is a sadist. But my mind still circles around the abuse. I have a hard time not thinking about it. So what do I do? Write about it, of course. Now it's on the web, and hopefully out of my way." created="Fri, 18 Jan 2013 13:45:34 GMT" pgfnum="17326"/>
				<outline text="One more thing. I remember being at a conference, chatting with someone and I saw at the other end of the room someone who had been a friend but had started trashing me on the Internet. I excused myself and walked over to the guy and sat down next to him, and asked why he was doing it. He started repeating the nonsense he was saying online. But I didn't think he really believed it, so I pressed him and asked why he was &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; doing it. He said he had cancer, and was in chemo, and was in a lot of pain. I felt sick myself in that moment. I said you know that's terrible, but it's no reason to do and say things that hurt me, and make me feel bad. We all have our struggles. Me too. He agreed, and we're friends again, but now when I see him online, I can't forget how &lt;i&gt;used&lt;/i&gt; I was, and why, and the pain comes back, his pain and mine. This really sucks.

And I definitely can't claim I was a harder worker -- I've never worked particularly hard, I've always just tried doing things I find fun. Instead, what I concluded was that I was more curious -- but not because I had been born that way. If you watch little kids, they are intensely curious, always exploring and trying to figure out how things work. The problem is that school drives all that curiosity out. Instead of letting you explore things for yourself, it tells you that you have to read these particular books and answer these particular questions. And if you try to do something else instead, you'll get in trouble. Very few people's curiosity can survive that. But, due to some accident, mine did. I kept being curious and just followed my curiosity.&quot;"/>

I knew her pretty well, and I don't think she would have approved all the laughter. But dead people are dead.

But when he died, I didn't feel I was ready to write about it publicly for a bit of time. Probably because he was so close in age to me, just ten years older. A role model for me.

				<outline text="In family, and online, I've come to respect the way people grieve is different for everyone, as it was for people at my grandmother's funeral, so many years ago. Everyone has a different process, and it could be different every time depending on who-knows-what. Death is something that I find impossible to understand. That's why it's so damned frightening. Maybe it's no more unpleasant than taking a trip. Maybe god is merciful and death is a pleasurable release full of spritual oxytocin. There are reasons to believe this might be so. Maybe death is something that's impossible to experience, much as we have no memory of existence from before conception? Death is a mystery, a horrifying one, if you love life. All the more horrifying if someone reaches a place where death is a choice they make. I find it especially hard to reach any conclusions about that.

He was very much his age, emotionally, even if he had knowledge beyond his years. To expect so much of such a young person probably puts too big a weight on shoulders that aren't prepared for it.

He used to say &quot;Don't truth me and I won't truth you.&quot; But that week was different. He had a bunch of things he wanted to get off his chest. He didn't go so far as to forgive anyone, or say things that would make him vulnerable or embarassed. A lifetime of holding back on these things doesn't break in a week, no matter how close you are to death. And it wasn't his fault. He grew up into a world that told men that they had to be strong.

I bet a lot of them were my age at the time (28), that is, younger than Michael and myself. And they were right to be upset. We called both products ThinkTank.

Don't you want your users to be successful? Isn't that why you're making software. All these are reasons why anyone, not just Apple, should strive for continutity for users. I suppose there are times when you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to break users. But to break them for aesthetic reasons, when it's totally optional, that's a sign of bad things to come.

And since this is my main work machine, muddling along meant less productivity. More lost trains-of-thought as I have to locate the scroll thumb and delicately move it up or down small amounts to get the text to scroll by two or three lines. The scroll arrows are always in the same place, and you click once to move by one line. No care required. " created="Wed, 20 Feb 2013 14:17:37 GMT" pgfnum="14394"/>

				<outline text="4. Even though I'm a fan, I think public editors should be from the public, not journalism. And a publication of the stature of the Times should have many of them. The rule is they could put something on the Times website, adjacent to the articles they're commenting on, and they could say whatever they need to say to create balance. They wouldn't have indefinite terms, and it would be possible to fire them, but only if they breached ethical standards themselves. " created="Fri, 15 Feb 2013 14:13:21 GMT" pgfnum="18691">
					<outline text="Some stories need lots of public editors, and maybe the public editors should be given anonymity. An example is the run-up to the war in Iraq when all the publications carried the same wrong story. Another, more recent example is the telling of the life story of Aaron Swartz. I knew Aaron, and I read many of the stories, shaking my head at the awful reporting. You can forgive Aaron's friends for distorting the truth, perhaps -- they were grieving. But what were the reporters' excuses? If they were emotionally tied to the story they should have been excused. The purpose of a news publication is to tell the truth, especially if it's unpopular. The Times  has a public editor because it wasn't living up to this ideal, and they knew it, and presumably wanted to do something to fix it. But it's too big a job for just one person.

				<outline text="5. All pubs should have someone like Ms Sullivan. Over the years, I've had a number of disputes that cut to the integrity of reporters at major publications, like the one Mr Musk has with the Times. None of them have had public editors, and none of them ever resolved the issue one way or the other. One even threatened to sue me for libel if I didn't stop saying they were doing something wrong (a British publication). Imagine if a software company threatened every user who reported a bug.

				<outline text="7. I've long felt that each blogger who values his or her reputiation should have a panel of &quot;rabbis&quot; who will respond to public integrity challenges. If my rabbis say I have to address a certain issue, then I will. If they say it's not an issue, I can go about my business without responding. This would do a lot to increase confidence, and also protect us from troll-like accusations. I think it's possible the same system could work for publications too.

I don't expect Sullivan to say either of these things unless it's so obvious as to be indisputable. And it won't be. She will tell us what both sides say and will look at the data herself. She'll look at what others say, and will suggest that while Musk has a fine product he has probably engaged in a little self-promotion here. And that the Times can and should have some new policy for testing cars. We will get a decent list of sources to examine ourselves, and we will, as always, make up our own minds.

				<outline text="3. This is a theme of modern media. It's why Napster was such a breakthrough. All of a sudden instead of being programmed, I could do the programming myself. Same thing with the travel industry, vacation rentals, retail, love -- everything. By now the pattern should be obvious to everyone. The users do the programming now. It creates new interest in, and demand for, creativity. THe fear of the entertainment industry was a fear of change. There was never a reason to be scared of irrelevance. Creativity is more in demand now that it ever was. " created="Tue, 05 Feb 2013 18:03:14 GMT" pgfnum="18273"/>

It's as if the Netflix management had a come-to-jesus type off-site and the chairman said to his people -- what do our customers really want and let's see if we can give it to them. The result was House of Cards. Exactly on the terms that the users have been demanding since Napster. Entertain us, but we want to do the programming ourselves.

				<outline text="9. When you do that, you'll see very clearly that what the news industry needs is a cooperative venture that's external to all the news orgs, as Hulu was to the entertainment divisions of the networks, and boot up a new distribution system. Twitter and Facebook have shown you how to do it, although it wasn't necessary to wait this long -- you've now waited long enough. The new system will look like Twitter. You have to be present everywhere your news is in demand. The news industry should have a system tailored to the realities of news, the way Netflix has moved to become the HBO of the Internet age. We need news like that too." created="Tue, 05 Feb 2013 18:11:44 GMT" pgfnum="18279"/>
				<outline text="10. News orgs should also bring bloggers in-house, not to write for their pubs, but to co-locate intellectually. I wrote about this in an earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/january/ifTheNytHadCojones&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, where I suggested the NYT do this. I did not mean to say that they should publish the bloggers in the paper or on its website. Just house them on premises. I'm thinking about serendipity. Overhearing elevator conversations. Eating lunch in the same cafeteria, waiting in the same line for the coffee cart. Inevitably the two cultures will influence each other and this would be good for both.

At 88 he had become frail. Now come the memorials. Let's hope they don't lose their perspective. Ed Koch was no saint. He had a sharp tongue, and over his many years in public life he made many enemies. But he was also much loved in NY. Before Koch, the city was drifting in a post-Robert Moses funk. It was dirty and unsafe and in many ways just didn't work. Koch did much to turn the city around. And he didn't apologize for being a New Yorker. When he asked &quot;How am I doing?&quot; don't think it wasn't with much irony. What could &lt;i&gt;possibly&lt;/i&gt; stop a New Yorker from telling you how you're doing. And it's not usually going to come with a hug or a pat on the back, although Koch was the exception, on the boardwalk in Coney Island or in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/nyregion/edward-i-koch-ex-mayor-of-new-york-dies.html&quot;&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt; under Manhattan, people told him to keep up the good work. We appreciated what he was doing for the city. NY is and was and always will be a tough place, on a personal level. But it's a place of symbols. Koch was us, and the reflection wasn't so bad. We have a sense of humor, a sense of what-the-fuck. Somehow we'll get through this, and a feeling that it can be better if we work together, dammit.

In &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/whyYouShouldLearnToCode&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; particularly egregious case, they were quoting NBA players on why you should learn to code!

				<outline text="My answer was that like almost every operation in an outliner, select-all is &lt;i&gt;scoped.&lt;/i&gt; When you select a headline, you are implicitly selecting all the headlines that are subordinate to it.

				<outline text="So here are some answers to frequently asked question." created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:22:23 GMT" pgfnum="21419"/>
				<outline text="1. Where is local storage stored? It varies from browser to browser. Some users have explored in the system settings folders on various operating systems and found the files. They look like they're SQL databases. " created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:22:39 GMT" pgfnum="21420"/>
				<outline text="2. How much space does it use? The per-domain limit is 5MB." created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:23:34 GMT" pgfnum="21421"/>
				<outline text="3. When you clear the cache does local storage get cleared too? I don't know. " created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:39:28 GMT" pgfnum="21425"/>
				<outline text="4. Isn't local storage like cookies? Yes, it's very much like cookies, except cookies are limited to 4K, and local storage can go up to 5MB. The difference in size reflects the difference in times. When cookies were invented, in the mid-90s, computers had a lot less memory. Today it's not uncommon for a new computer to have a terabyte of disk space. 5MB today is like what 4K was back then. It seems silly to live in a world limited by the machines of the past. But cookies couldn't change without risking breakage, of the web itself. So local storage was a good answer. Also local storage is simpler to program than cookies, but not so much simpler as to make a huge difference." created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:39:50 GMT" pgfnum="21426"/>
				<outline text="5. Isn't this a potentially dangerous feature? We are very responsible about our software, we just want people to make outlines and be happy and want to use the new stuff we come out with. This is a business for us. So we would never use it in a harmful way. Not only would it be against our interest, but it would be professionally unthinkable. That said, localStorage &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a potentially dangerous feature, in the hands of a malicious website. This is something the browser vendors will probably have to address sooner or later. Probably sooner. ;-)" created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:30:41 GMT" pgfnum="21423"/>
				<outline text="6. How can I get rid of what you stored on my computer? I can only answer for our product. If you delete all the text in your outline, that will get rid of most of what we store. There will still be an empty outline in local storage, and a count of the number of times you saved. That takes up about 140 characters, or coincidentally, the size of a tweet. If even this is too much to bear, we can add a way for you to delete that too.

That's one of the main reasons Twitter was such an effective competitor. The central server keeps an OPML file for each user. Each site with a feed links to that site with the URL of its feed as a parameter. When the user clicks a Subscribe link, a dialog appears confirming that you want to subscribe. If you say OK that's it, nothing more to do. The user never sees a URL. No browser has to cooperate (not that they would). " created="Fri, 15 Mar 2013 01:39:01 GMT" pgfnum="20432"/>
				<outline text="OPML should be a file type you can subscribe to. That makes it possible for the user to connect their account on the central subscription server to your aggregator.

				<outline text="Also in the argument betw mailbox and river type readers, why not do both? The same data can be viewed either way. Some times you may just have a few minutes to quickly skim the news, and other times you may be able to read feeds individually at a slower pace. I did something like this in the LBBS software in the early 80s. There was a river, and a hierarchic view. You could switch instantly between the two views, and stay on the same item. The same approach would work well for RSS (though I've never seen it done, if I were doing a new reader, I'd definitely give it a try)." created="Fri, 15 Mar 2013 01:40:46 GMT" pgfnum="20433"/>

That would make it possible to do more things with RSS. I don't want to subscribe to a special feed about a specific event, knowing I'll have to remember to unsub. Better to let the feed tell the reader.

It was character-based, on a scrolling display. You'd type commands like &lt;code&gt;1,$p&lt;/code&gt; to show all the lines at the current level. You could view the subs of any headline, by typing the number next to it, and pressing Return. The basic operations were &quot;dive&quot; and &quot;surface.&quot; Moving things around was a little more difficult, but it was the best you could do with the computers of the day.

				<outline text="The tools advanced through the years. Influenced by Visicalc, then Lotus 1-2-3. That's when the outliner got a &quot;bar cursor&quot; which points to a structure, much like Visicalc's cursor points to a spreadsheet cell. You moved the cursor around with the arrow keys, and expanded by pressing &lt; and collapsed by pressing &gt;. These keys were chosen as mnemonics, they looked symbolically like the operations they were performing. " created="Thu, 14 Mar 2013 17:02:43 GMT" pgfnum="20400"/>
				<outline text="Pretty soon after that we got the mouse, so you could double-click to expand and collapse and also drag things from one place to another. This made stuff flow better.

The chances of either of them reading what I write are pretty close to nil, so the chances of them passing along a good idea that I might have are therefore also nil. This is embarassing, because the epiphany of Klein's that Pierce mocks happens to be one that I have been writing about for almost 20 years, over and over. Think of all the time everyone could have saved if they deigned to pay attention to people who don't do what they do. It's tragic that it took a smart guy like Klein so long to understand such a basic structural truth about how news, his own profession, has been working &lt;i&gt;for the last 15 years.&lt;/i&gt; Gives you some idea about the power of the blinders this community puts on." collapse="true" created="Tue, 12 Mar 2013 15:51:29 GMT" pgfnum="20219">

				<outline text="Conversely, we can put formatting capabilities into an outliner, but it would behave like an outliner, not a word processor. We fully explored this with MORE, the users loved it, but they still needed to export to Word or Pagemaker if print formatting was important. "/>

				<outline text="An outliner is designed for editing structure more than it is for editing text. The text is sort of &quot;along for the ride.&quot; Or you could see an outliner as text-on-rails.

				<outline text="The reason a program has to be either a word processor or an outliner is this: There's only one keyboard, and one set of mouse gestures. The identity of a product is determined by choices made by the designer. Word processors are good at selecting words, sentences and paragraphs. Outliners select headlines and all their subs. Shift-click in the two apps do vastly different things, yet in both cases they are &quot;extending the selection.&quot; Even the data structures used by the programs are different. Yet superficially they look similar. "/>
				<outline text="Some great software designers were fooled by this in the first go-around. Probably the guys who did Word thought at first that they were equalling our outliner, but I guess over time they realized what we learned too. That you need to know what your product is supposed to do before you make those choices. Otherwise it ends up as a confusing unusable mess. That's why Lotus 1-2-3 was a magical product, and Symphony, that confronted this problem head-on and didn't solve it (because it doesn't have a solution) never had 1-2-3's balance and sharp-edge feel.

					<outline text="Apple's iTunes is another good example. It's all over the map, doing a dozen different things, without a single idea tying it all together. You can tell that the designers are confused too, because in each rev the commands move around and are re-named.

				<outline text="This goes back to one of the themes of my talk on Wednesday night at the Boston Globe. People feel a need to be part of the world they live in. Most of us feel like we're on the sidelines, spectators, consumers, eyeballs, credit card numbers, and that's not what we want. We want meaning. We want to make a contribution. We want do do good and have that good make a difference. If you look at what people actually do, not the stories you read in the paper or hear on CNN, this is obvious. The bombings not only worried people, for a short time when the scope of the danger was unknown, but people also saw the opportunity to get some of the precious stuff, meaning and relevance.

				<outline text="Why was this a theme of my talk at the Globe? Because the news industry has the ability to offer people exactly what they want, but they won't do it. Their view of the world is that we're out there and they're inside. They talk, we listen. They are relevant, their lives have meaning. The meaning of our lives is not important to them. As long as they view it that way, people will continue to be frustrated by them, as long as they pay any attention. And more and more they're chosing to not pay attention.

For these people I just needed to show how  Fargo picked up on the ideas in those products and brought them into the technology world of 2013. But in a couple of cases, the people, smart and accomplished, had no idea what I was talking about, so I had to start from the beginning.

It's about expression. It's about bringing change to the world, it's about &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; the change.

				<outline text="3. Fargo is deceptively simple. You edit documents within documents, nesting them and organizing to as many levels as you need. Reorganize structures with a single gesture. Expand to see the detail or zoom out to see the big picture. "/>
				<outline text="4. Dropbox is brilliant and transformative. Coupled with the deep power of Fargo, you get a profoundly powerful work environment that goes everywhere. "/>
				<outline text="5. You can share outlines with friends and co-workers, or publicly."/>

				<outline text="We've created a little slide-show renderer, using the beautiful JavaScript presentations of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/&quot;&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt;. Then we added an &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/31/screen1.gif&quot;&gt;icon&lt;/a&gt; to the left side-bar of Little Outliner that takes the content of the bar cursor outline and shoots it over to the presenter. It in turn sends back the HTML which we then display in a preview &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/31/screen2.gif&quot;&gt;window&lt;/a&gt;. All this is done with interfaces that are every bit as simple as they sound. " created="Mon, 01 Apr 2013 17:05:19 GMT" pgfnum="21900"/>
				<outline text="All this is accomplished with OPML, which is an incredible way to package up a structure of text to ship between programs. It's almost a whole language unto itself for specifying the arrangement of text. And as you know, we have an easy editor for producing OPML (the world-famous Little Outliner you've heard so much about). And with all the experimentation that's been done in JavaScript tools for presenting stuff, the outliner is the missing element that makes this stuff truly user-friendly. If you don't believe me, have a look at the docs for &lt;a href=&quot;http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/&quot;&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js/&quot;&gt;bespoke.js&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored&quot;&gt;impress.js&lt;/a&gt;. All of them produce wonderfully animated presentations, but you have to be a real glutton for tech detail to even begin to create your own. But with an outliner it's dramatically easy." created="Mon, 01 Apr 2013 17:06:46 GMT" pgfnum="21902"/>

You say that's inflationary, and I'm no economist, but I have a bit of common sense.

				<outline text="As discourse has moved to Twitter, its big contribution has been to push aside the abuse that's common with discussion boards and mail lists. A very simple feature in Twitter, the block command, enforces decorum, by empowering the listener to turn you off if they find you offensive. People learn that if they say abusive things, they don't have to listen. The only people I listen to on Twitter are those who can make a point without getting personal. I learn from disagreement, but I can't stand people who use their freedom to speak as a way of hurting others. " created="Tue, 21 May 2013 12:36:21 GMT" pgfnum="24214"/>
				<outline text="Then I wondered -- if it works so well for Twitter -- why can't sites block Hacker News if the abuse gets too heavy? After yesterday's experience I probably would do it.

				<outline text="So I have a suggestion for Paul Graham, the guy who runs Hacker News. Give sites the option of blocking links from Hacker News. I honestly don't care what the HN trolls, and the people who upvote them, supposedly &quot;think&quot; about me. None of it is based on anything real. A lot of it is anonymous.

					<outline text="1. &lt;b&gt;Standardization&lt;/b&gt;." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:40:52 GMT" pgfnum="23700">
						<outline text="The Mac beat the IBM PC because there were user interface standards. If I learned how to use a couple of apps, I was actually learning how to use all of them. If your river and my river work and act differently, we have no advantage, and people are going to stay with Twitter, because there, the UI for all rivers is the same. True, it's limited to 140 characters, but the advantages of standardization make Twitter easy and familiar." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:41:22 GMT" pgfnum="23703"/>
						<outline text="It should also be possible for users to combine rivers. I want Reuters and Wired rivers, for example, but I don't want to go to two places to view their news. Again with standards, we don't have to force readers to make a choice. This means growth for the alternate-Twitter, which is the potential of news moving to rivers. " created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:43:42 GMT" pgfnum="23704"/>
						<outline text="Standardization is something the tech industry has a hard time with. But my experience with news and RSS is that it's not as much of a problem with publishing. Once we had the NYT on board, all the other pubs followed, compatibly, without the usual fighting that happens in tech." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:45:01 GMT" pgfnum="23705">

							</outline>
						<outline text="I offer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=dave&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; we're using for rivers. It's a simple jQuery template, and an equally simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://riverjs.org/&quot;&gt;JSON format&lt;/a&gt;. The template was designed by an open &lt;a href=&quot;http://beautriver1.blorkmark.com/&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; in a Google Group a couple of years ago. I designed the JSON format to help define the problem for the group. It was a wonderfully successful open collaboration. I hope other people just use it as-is.

					<outline text="2. &lt;b&gt;Open the doors&lt;/b&gt;." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:40:56 GMT" pgfnum="23701">
						<outline text="This part, I believe, will be difficult for news organizations. But, if you want to compete with Twitter, you have to include bloggers in your stream. I don't mean reporters who call themselves bloggers, rather people who have expertise or experience that makes them the kind of people reporters like to quote. People whose ideas you think are dangerous. More of that. " created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:47:54 GMT" pgfnum="23707"/>
						<outline text="News needs reforming, literally, it needs to be formed again around the new reality -- we all have printing presses. News will never reform itself until it feels the pressure from the sources, where it matters most, on the screens of their readers." created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:49:07 GMT" pgfnum="23708"/>
						<outline text="We need to have one environment where professional reporters, sources and critics co-mingle their thoughts. We don't need a Public Editor as much as we need The Public. That's why Twitter has been so popular, but it's unfortunate that the news industry has been unwilling to meet them there. " created="Fri, 10 May 2013 15:50:04 GMT" pgfnum="23709"/>

				<outline text="The war is over what information you and I get, and what information they get. "/>
				<outline text="As we get less, they get more. As we lose control, they gain it. "/>
				<outline text="In this war, the governments have more in common than they have differences. The Chinese probably could destroy our banking system, and we could probably destroy theirs, but they don't want that, and our government doesn't either. They're really on the same side."/>
				<outline text="What they want is to keep order, I really believe that. The order that keeps the rich rich, and more or less ignores the challenges we all face in keeping our species alive on this planet. I understand the sentiment. There's so much to comprehend, if you want to have any kind of quality of life, you have to compartmentalize. If you look at preserving order, you can't pay attention to climate change."/>
				<outline text="I think though we all know the precarious system of banking and computer networks isn't going to keep running forever. There's going to be a meltdown. We had one in 2008, and it looks like we just re-inflated the bubble temporarily, bought a little time, it's just going to get us back to where we were, only this time the pop will be bigger. "/>
				<outline text="If you were President of the United States, and you saw a certain probability of this happening, you'd re-up on the side of preserving order. That means you have to be prepared for the day when people go to the ATM and find their bank account is inaccessible. When it happens to everyone even. How are the rich people going to enjoy their lifestyles when that kind of chaos is going on? It seems quite possible we'll live to see this happen. "/>
				<outline text="It's all tech, top to bottom. The banking system is tech. The military is tech. And in that context, it's not surprising that our, the people's, information access systems are really weak compared to the ones the governments have. That's no accident. Our tools have been getting more precarious, thanks to bugs introduced by the browser vendors (if they're not deliberate, they're incredibly incompetent, your choice). And Google captured almost all the tech of RSS, only to shut it down. Just as things show some sign of coming back to life, now Facebook sounds like they'd like to have their turn at pwning the open public news flow. Please, if you make a feed, and you read this, keep making the feed as-is, no matter what Facebook asks you to do to it. By now it should be obvious that the big tech companies are not our friends. They're more like the government than they are like you and me. Maybe not their fault, maybe they didn't see it coming, but I doubt they'd deny that they're there now. "/>
				<outline text="JavaScript is another item that we should be thinking about. Google is developing the same kind of power over the programming language of the Internet that they had over RSS. Over time they're likely to move their implementation of JS away from the standard. I've spent most of the last year programming in JS, and I think there's a lot to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57584979-93/google-dart-will-rescue-browsers-from-javascript/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; for making the language smaller and more efficient. But I'm a newbie, and if I had spent the last five years developing in it, the last thing I'd want to hear is that the language itself is considered a moving target. So, net-net, we have to insist that for now at least JS stay what it is. I don't trust anything about Google to do this right. They may think they know what they're doing, but they led us right into control by the government. That's a mess that needs undoing, and they shouldn't be creating any more messes. "/>
				<outline text="One more note. I said a while back that if you want to understand politics you have to become deeply immersed in tech. The political reporters and bloggers have been totally too casual about that, even the smart relatively open-minded ones, and that even includes Glenn Greenwald. Is he really prepared to listen to Snowden, or can he just report an approximation of what Snowden tells him? It's the latter, because as smart as Greenwald is, he hasn't been spending the last N years schooling himself in the technology that we've built our existence around. "/>

But I'd rather if Matt ignored my age and my financial circumstances, and looked at the actual software I'm writing -- today -- not in the past. I would prefer if he said: I think Dave's new software is interesting, but I don't understand it. Or I think Dave's software is revolutionary and it will have impact on all software being developed today.

It filled in a perspective that I had not heard. And yet I spent lots of time talking with nurses during my father's long hospital stay in 2002, and my own -- the same year.

				<outline text="Back then, I had an epiphany about people who work in hospitals, who work in conditions most of us find incomprehensible, helping people in unimaginable pain, unimaginable until it's time for you to deal with it. The epiphany is that it must be wonderful to see the good you do, so clearly. In my own field, software development, it can be hard to feel how you're helping. In fact you get a lot of people sharing pain with you they can't find other outlets for. I learned in reading the post that it's the same in nursing. " created="Mon, 30 Dec 2013 17:36:25 GMT"/>

				<outline text="First the headphones. I like to say I buy headphones the way some women I've known buy shoes. I have a closet shelf full of them. Most of them I tried out for a few days or maybe a week or two and put them away, still in search of the ideal set. " created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 16:56:23 GMT" img="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/12/29/velodyne.gif" url="http://velodyne.com/vfree-headphones.html"/>
				<outline text="But after I bought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A6YPCK8/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Velodyne vFree&lt;/a&gt; headphones I not only stopped buying new phones, I starting giving the old ones away to friends. And these were some great listening devices. But none of them put it all together like the Velodyne." created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 16:58:17 GMT"/>
				<outline text="First, they are wireless Bluetooth headphones. You wouldn't believe how much of a mess those wires are for me. Always getting tangled and knotted. Limiting movement. Pulling on my ears and the device. Now I look at people listening on their iPods on the subway and think that in two years the wires will all be gone. Once you try it this way there's no going back. " created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 16:59:05 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Also, they're loud enough, and the sound quality is great. A lot of good headphones need an amplifier when used with a mobile device. Not sure why, but it's observable. I guess these headphones, because they have their own power source, have their own amp. Regardless, you don't miss anything with these guys, and music has the feel it's supposed to. And it's a clean sound, maybe a little heavy on the bass, but I like that way. But not so much as some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beatsbydre.com/&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;. ;-)" created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 17:23:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Another thing that's great about wireless is you can wear them around the house without carrying the player with you. " created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 18:25:42 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Now there are problems with wireless. You have to remember to keep it charged. But that's a discipline we've all learned by now. It's just one more device. It takes the same kind of USB cable that Kindles and Google phones do. You probably already have a few. And the Bluetooth connection sometimes drops, but for some reason for me now not so much as it did in the beginning. It feels like my devices have learned to find each other. I know that can't be true, but..." created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 17:00:40 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Now the other device is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/us/buy-ipad/ipad-mini-retina/64gb-space-gray-wifi-cellular-verizon&quot;&gt;new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. I got one with 64GB and LTE. I used Verizon because I already have a T-Mobile device (my Nexus 5), and this gives me a bit of redundancy that may come in handy. Both devices tether. Glad we got over that argument! ;-) " created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 17:02:18 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I bought an iPad Air when it came out and loved it, but that got handed down, because I very much wanted to try an iPad that fits in my jacket pocket, which the Mini most definitely does. I miss the larger screen sometimes, but I love the portability. With a few tweaks, I can see not carrying a phone. But remember, it's winter and cold, so I'm pretty much always wearing a jacket. We'll see how it works in summer, when I'm back doing daily bike rides in summer clothes. " created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 17:03:45 GMT"/>
				<outline text="But the iPad Air is as rational and lovely a product as the Velodyne, and of course the two go together perfectly, and connect over an open standard, so it's a religion-conformant combination. At the end of the year, it's clear that these two products made the most difference to me, and appeal to my tastes and lifestyle almost perfectly. " created="Sun, 29 Dec 2013 17:05:24 GMT"/>

Being a developer must be wonderful! Everything is taken care of for you. All you have to do is put up some dialogs, use our code, and in a few weeks you get rich! And you don't have to deal with the asshole execs. And whatever other grief comes from working in a large organization (which I now understand much better, but still from a distance). Of course none of this has anything to do with what it's like to be a developer. Our paychecks are iffy. We don't have health insurance. You always break our stuff because you don't care or understand. Most of us go out of business leaving the founders unemployed and broken. Etc etc. " created="Sun, 22 Dec 2013 14:47:42 GMT"/>

They probably like to live where they live, like you they have friends and family nearby, a job perhaps, and moving to Walnut Creek or Petaluma isn't what they want to do. And the rest of us who use your stuff, and don't like to be pushed around either, are feeling a little sympathy for the protesters. " created="Sun, 22 Dec 2013 14:52:26 GMT"/>

And there are only five playing at a time. You get to study them. The Knicks are stuck in hell, and it's really no player's fault. A team is not the sum of the parts. You can't do math on the players on a team. The Knicks are proof of that. What the Knicks are missing is drive. You have to have talent, think as a unit, be smart, that's enough to get you on the court. Now what's your ambition? It's not what you &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt; your ambition is, because Melo says his is to win a championship. But it's laughable when he says it. I'm sure he wants to be on a team that wins a championship. That means he has to hook up with a guy like LeBron. Years ago he was too young and lacked the confidence to let a stronger person boss him around. I think that's what the Knicks struggle is really about.

At the beginning, Coke was #1 and there really was no #2. Until Pepsi discovered that people, if given a choice, would buy as much cola as they could. If the competition sold a tasty cola beverage in a 6.5-ounce bottle, touting it as the perfect size for all, offer a 12-ounce bottle at the same price. And voila, a strong #2 is born.

Quietly off on the side have a few of your best developers do a total clone of Twitter, but instead of a 140-character limit, make it 240 characters.

Or if you just love the puzzles that programming is constantly presenting you with. You have to have a certain amount of self-hatred to love programming, btw, because it's a grind. And to do it well you have to have a lot of all of these things." created="Wed, 11 Dec 2013 12:46:20 GMT"/>

But that's not what coding is about. If you want power, and I've said this many times -- rather than learn to code -- first learn to run a server. That's real power. And it's far easier than programming. You can learn to run a server in a few days or weeks. There's not much to it. Servers are just computers, like a laptop, that are always on and have a net connection that never goes away. They run software that's a little different from the stuff you run, but if you can install a word processor or a graphics program, you can learn how to run a web server. And you will be able to publish whatever you want. But then you kind of have to be a blogger to appreciate that, so we're back to the beginning. " created="Tue, 10 Dec 2013 17:50:07 GMT"/>

				<outline text="What happened? I think you have to take it at face value. Carmelo Anthony figured something out that has up to now eluded him -- that he plays on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt;. I know that sounds flip or sarcastic, but it's actually the most direct way to say it. I'm sure he's a very smart guy (again, no sarcasm) because to perform at the level he does requires not just great physical ability, he's got to have a great computer upstairs. But things elude even very smart people. I speak from experience, with all possible humility. Sometimes the truth is hiding in plain sight." created="Sat, 07 Dec 2013 15:28:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="It is very easy to defend against the Knicks if there is only one strong shooter on the team. So when Melo is the only one connecting, the Knicks lose. Over time, they start losing a lot. That's what happened in the first sixteen games in this season. What happened in the Nets game, and it worked, is that other guys got hot, and Melo let them have the ball." created="Sat, 07 Dec 2013 15:30:24 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If the Knicks want to try a really radical approach now, they might cast Melo not as a forward, rather as the point guard. It's his job to bring the ball back on the offense. Then he calls the play and gets the ball to the open man. He's watching the defense as much as the offense. Who have they left open. Bing. That's the guy. That's a good next approach, imho in redesigning the Knicks with the current roster. Don't trade anyone. " created="Sat, 07 Dec 2013 15:31:33 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The last two games have been fun to watch. That's all I ask for as a fan. Sure it would be nice if the Knicks were to go deep into the playoffs.

				<outline text="PS: Now that I have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabs.mediahackers.org/?panel=nba&quot;&gt;NBA river&lt;/a&gt;, I'm getting more of the good gossip. I realized I needed it when my building super knew more about the Knicks than I did because he reads the NY Post. Even though their politics are offensive, their Knicks reporting is good. Anyway, they say that Melo is trying to recruit Rajon Rondo from the Celtics to play on the Knicks. That actually would be a good move, imho. A strong fast even explosive point guard to go with Melo would probably work really well. Like OKC with Westbrook and Durant. You need both to make it work. I think oddly, the Knicks would be much better off if they had kept Jeremy Lin, and if Melo had been willing to work with him (he was clearly offended by his presence). But Rondo, Melo and Chandler (if he gets healthy) would be a pretty awesome combination." created="Sat, 07 Dec 2013 15:54:55 GMT"/>

I just wanted  answers to basic questions about the way the Snowden Docs are being handled, and deal with questions that would inevitably come up, from less friendly sources. At this point I'm no friend of this venture's.

It should result in reform in the US government, really the world government, because the disease seems to infect all of them.

Yet supposedly credible journalists, ones who still insist on our respect (including Bill Keller, btw, the subject of another recent Internet controversy), went along with the lies, and never acknowledged or apologized for all the death they caused.

It's never before happened here. We don't know about other planets elsewhere in our galaxy or the universe.

				<outline text="Second, the mundane things we do every day, the example she provided was driving to get groceries, are actually totally extraordinary. When we get in the car to run errands we're burning the bodies of animals that lived millions of years ago.

We praised their product, their achievement, and they showed off our work. Apple took a serious stake in the success of software on their platform. They also had strong opinions about how our software should work, which in hindsight were almost all good ideas. The idea of user interface standards were at the time controversial. Today, you'll get no argument from me. It's better to have one way to do things, than have two or more, no matter how much better the new ones are. " created="Wed, 22 Jan 2014 17:29:36 GMT"/>

By 1986, with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Campbell_(business_executive)&quot;&gt;Bill Campbell&lt;/a&gt; at Apple, we got Macs for every employee at our growing company, and our board of directors, and the die was cast -- we became a Mac software company. The Mac was berry berry good to me (a dated reference to a fictional &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_Saturday_Night_Live_characters_and_sketches_introduced_1978%E2%80%931979#Chico_Escuela&quot;&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; from the 80s on SNL)." created="Fri, 03 Jan 2014 14:56:02 GMT"/>
				<outline text="But the Mac, while it was a brilliant vision, and it's gestalt so lovely, was in its first incarnation, a flawed product. It didn't have enough memory for a machine with so much graphic potential. The screen was tiny, as were the floppy disks. The product came at a time when personal computers were getting hard drives, but the Mac had no ability to expand. The mouse was wonderful, but sometimes you need cursor keys. The first Mac didn't have them. The Mac was a statement, that's for sure -- but it wasn't a very &lt;i&gt;usable&lt;/i&gt; statement, at least in its first incarnation." created="Wed, 22 Jan 2014 17:22:56 GMT"/>

				<outline text="But what about the long-term historical perspective of the Mac. There, the verdict is not so good. Most of the hype about the 30th Anniversary has left out this part. True, all personal computers to follow were basically copies of the Mac, some good, some not so good. The ideas were very valid, and have stood the test of time. But it's the missed opportunities caused by the Mac's insistence on being right about everything, even when the Mac was wrong, that caused the fractures in the marketplace that are still visible today in the UI of software, and in the confusion of non-expert users." created="Fri, 03 Jan 2014 14:57:38 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Try this out sometime with a friend who is a casual computer user who has a WordPress blog. Ask them to choose a command from a menu, and see which one they choose. There are three menu systems on the screen at the same time! One for the operating system, one for the browser, and one for the web app. This is not simple and not easy to use, and is the result of Apple's proprietary networking, way back in the 80s, that forced the innovation in networking, that was the manifest destiny of personal computers, to route around the closed-off networking protocols of the Macintosh. Had Apple, instead of keeping the right to create networking software for itself almost exclusively, because their APIs were so confusing, taken the opposite approach -- that their APIs were not proprietary and could be cloned by other manufacturers freely, and built on by software developers, again, freely, the networks we use today would work in vastly different and imho, much better ways. We'd also be much further along. In many ways, the networking user interfaces we use today are inferior to the ones we used on the Mac in the 80s." created="Fri, 03 Jan 2014 14:59:44 GMT"/>

A pair of developers who made an email app the was bought by Microsoft and became their mail product (the founder of that company, Steve Ullman, was a real visionary). And Don Brown at CE Software with QuickMail. I tried to work with all of them, but it wasn't enough of a critical mass to make a market. I deperately wanted networking for MORE, my outliner. I felt it wasn't complete without it. Had Apple been less restrictive, my career would have been much more interesting. We have the networking today that I wanted then. But it was a long time coming.

I actually said the words to a doctor, and got an understanding response, to my surprise. I never talked about it with any of my friends or family members. They wouldn't have heard it, and sometimes when people don't want to hear things, it can get ugly quickly. So you learn, as the person whose life is in the balance, to say nothing.

For him, it was the right thing to do. Doctors told us that he could fight (there's that word again) for a few more years of life, but his life, in his own estimation, wasn't worth it.

And the further you go, the more information you have about each of the branches, but at the end of one of them is something we have no information about at all. That's why it's so fear-inducing. And why it's easier for the healthy and young to think that when they get to this point of &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; lives, all they have to do is &quot;fight&quot; to avoid having to decide.

In the tweet, I said that the only thing transparent about Glenn Greenwald is his stonewalling. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/01/greenwald-not-hogging-snowden-documents.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which I was linking to, on the New York Magazine website, provided quotes from a Greenwald piece, without reporting the substance. In the piece they were citing, Greenwald answered the most important question I had been calling on him to answer. I had not read the Greenwald piece when I wrote that tweet. That was a mistake.

Not that there would be anything wrong with owning stock, but it is something that needed disclosure, something that I have explained over and over in a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+greenwald&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; late last year, none of which got this response from Greenwald or any of the other principals in the new company." created="Tue, 07 Jan 2014 14:28:53 GMT"/>
				<outline text="There are still other issues. Why the delay in saying he had no stock? And by item #4 in the Greenwald post, we're back to the normal Greenwald approach, over-stating his critics' concerns. At best, this is his lawyerly alter-ego popping up. At worst it makes me think he's still hiding important stuff. Not everyone is out to get him.

				<outline text="An important point, the Snowden documents don't belong to him or the Omidyar ventures. They don't belong to Snowden. They belong to the people of the United States. We have a huge stake in what's done with them. In normal times we'd trust the government to look out for the people's interest, but this is about the government abusing that trust. Greenwald is dancing with high charge explosives. We deserve his full devotion to this story. Why is now a good time for him to be involved in a startup? Why not wait until the Snowden disclosures are complete? Or if he must be involved in a startup, which I know from experience is a hugely time-consuming thing, why not pass the torch to another reporter, or group of reporters? Greenwald's newest response is that we're asking for a complete and immediate dump of the documents. I'm not asking for that! I don't know anyone else who is. What I do want to see is an honest, fair, complete, expedient and urgent disclosure of that information. Perhaps he should start a new venture just to disclose the information in those documents. These are the questions behind the questions about Greenwald's ownership position in the Omidyar companies. " created="Tue, 07 Jan 2014 14:37:42 GMT"/>

It betrays a point of view. If you're a writer, and someone refers to your work as &quot;content&quot; -- well that's like telling a painter his work is wall-covering. Yes technically, it's accurate -- your painting does cover the wall, Mr Rembrandt and Ms O'Keeffe. But there's also the inspiration. The joy. The dread, the lessons learned, the life lived, the gains and losses. The feeling. All that can be used to cover a wall, or provide a surface for ads to run. But calling it wall-covering doesn't capture its fullness." created="Sat, 04 Jan 2014 14:42:51 GMT" img="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/recjl7kex5i73dr/okeeffe.gif" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_O'Keeffe"/>
				<outline text="Yet there are times when you have to think of a painting as wall-covering -- if you're implementing a wall management system, and you need to account for people hanging all kinds of content on it, paintings, frescoes, posters, quilts, light -- incandescent and candles. Even chairs are wall-covering of a sort. Chandeliers, while they don't hang on a wall do provide light. Viewed that way all art is a wall-covering.

				<outline text="I'm a Knicks fan. I spent the winter in denial, but gradually as the season progressed, I realized I was following them more closely than any other team. And identifying with their ups and downs. And this year of course it's been mostly downs. It's okay. I was a Mets fan too. ;-)" created="Tue, 25 Feb 2014 22:00:29 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I have some weird theories about the fortunes of the Knicks. I think last year they did well because they had &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/8133070/veteran-point-guard-jason-kidd-agrees-deal-new-york-knicks&quot;&gt;Jason Kidd&lt;/a&gt; at guard. It seems like a very long time ago. This year, they have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nba/news/20140225/raymond-felton-felony-weapons-charges-new-york-knicks/&quot;&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; at point guard. And their star, Carmelo Anthony, needs a great point guard to work with. Pretty simple reason for this. Someone has to know who else is hot on the floor and make sure they get the ball almost as much as Melo. Otherwise the other team just double or even triple-teams Melo. It's easy to defend a team that has just one shooter, even if he's the best shooter in the league, as it is pretty clear Melo is (either #1 or #2). " created="Tue, 25 Feb 2014 22:01:15 GMT"/>
				<outline text="But Kidd turned 40 last season, so they knew it couldn't last. If Melo had been a bit more open-minded, I think he would have seen that Jeremy Lin, with his sharp eyes and mind, would have been a good student of Kidd's and a good distributor of the ball for a team that tends to rely too much on Melo.  " created="Tue, 25 Feb 2014 22:03:29 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I think this is a lesson for everyone in business or sport, anywhere creativity and seizing the moment matters. Don't always look for the answer where you expect it. Lin wasn't one of Melo's classmates from 2003. Melo &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a superstar. But he could have forged a partnership with Lin, made him his little buddy, and and built from there. It's amazing to see what Houston was able to do with creativity, and how it led to their signing of two players who, if they were playing with Melo, might have made New York, along with Anthony, a championship contender. The Knicks might not have been able to afford Dwight Howard and James Harden, but then New York is the center stage in the basketball world, and Houston is a backwater. But they're a backwater with a team we would &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; to have in New York." created="Tue, 25 Feb 2014 22:05:27 GMT"/>

I think we can reboot a little, maybe not in a huge way, but blogging as an activity could use a little love, a little sprucing up, some spring cleaning.

				<outline text="But while all that rebooting is happening, maybe Facebook et al could help facilitate the reboot?

" created="Sun, 23 Feb 2014 14:16:08 GMT"/>
				<outline text="One way they could help is by adopting some of the standards of the blogosphere, so their content can integrate with ours. For example, if I paste the URL of an RSS feed or an OPML file into a Facebook post, they could do something nice with it. Today they don't, at all. I discovered this yesterday by accident when I pasted a link to an RSS feed into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/211752402365506?stream_ref=10&quot;&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. I just tried an experiment and pasted a link to an OPML file, the canonical test outline -- states.opml, into Facebook. Again, nothing happened. OPML with its ability to structure information for presentation, would be a perfect complement to Facebook. Both are outgrowths of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&quot;&gt;graph theory&lt;/a&gt;, a subject that I studied as a college student many years ago (it was so funny to see Facebook use the terminology of my once-obscure avocation)." created="Sun, 23 Feb 2014 14:17:09 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If Facebook supported OPML and RSS, we could probably find some interesting ways to integrate our tools with their environment. That's how we're going to fix this silo problem, by knocking down some of the walls. If they'll let our content in, without having it hosted on their servers, it can have a dual life. &quot;Out here&quot; it can be indexed by Google and shared among other interested people, over long periods of time. And inside Facebook, we can share our thoughts with our friends and family, so they can keep up with what we're doing." created="Sun, 23 Feb 2014 14:22:07 GMT"/>

Rather, it's simply putting people at ease using a personal computer for something besides games. Think Tank is so easy to use, and so relatively errorproof, that even a first-timer feels as if he's in charge of the computer, instead of the other way around. And being in charge of the computer is what enables you to do with it things you may never have thought of doing before.&lt;/i&gt;"/>

				<outline text="The idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, as I see it, is to add a layer of standardization between the app developer and the &quot;hardware,&quot; in this case, the user interface offered by the modern HTML 5 web browser.  When you view it this way, there's nothing controversial about it. It's what engineers always do. When we see complicated chaos, we try to figure out what's really going on, and produce a simplified and rational view of it. Then all the code that rides on top of the new layer can also be rational and relatively simple. " created="Tue, 18 Feb 2014 18:47:38 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I want to tie-off the details of how menus work, for example, in one place, and once done, I never have to do it again. But there's another view of it. If there's only one place I do menus, and we have a rational abstraction of what a menu is, then we can slip in a whole other implementation behind it, and the upper-level code, unaware of the change, will still work. " created="Tue, 18 Feb 2014 18:52:15 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Even better if a large base of software agrees on how menus are done. Then people can create tools for authoring menus. So we get to a higher level. Something everyone had to do for themselves at one point, now is part of the toolkit that everyone can build on. " created="Tue, 18 Feb 2014 19:01:43 GMT"/>
				<outline text="This is how all software is built. Bootstrap is just another instance of this process, and a much-needed one. " created="Tue, 18 Feb 2014 18:58:03 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Another example, when I write Mac software, I don't get to say how menus or dialogs work. That's up to the operating system. That makes the developer's life easier, but it makes the user's life easier too. If you only have to learn how to use one type of menu, you can learn to use more types of software. Why waste time learning two ways to do something so common and simple?" created="Tue, 18 Feb 2014 18:53:38 GMT"/>

Almost everything you see on this website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/18/howIThinkAboutBootstrap.html&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, flows through Bootstrap in some way.

				<outline text="Over time the innovations of the past become commodities, and then are baked into the OS, creating room for innovation at a higher level.

				<outline text="I felt very lucky to get sick at almost the exact moment a new Netflix series came online, House of Cards, season 2. I had watched both the first season on Netflix and the BBC show it's based on. I thought the second season on Netflix was pretty awful. Lots of scenes that were obviously stretched out, presumably because they didn't have enough plot to fill the allotted time, or maybe enough money to fund the production. I watched because I had nothing better to do, but I wasn't impressed, or particularly entertained." created="Mon, 17 Feb 2014 17:49:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="When it was over, there was a void. What to do to fill the time now? A good friend suggested &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black&quot;&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;, so I gave it a try. It was a little slow and stupid at first. I really wasn't all that interested in a girly show about a yuppie who goes to prison for a year, but by the second and third episode, it was clear it wasn't that. It is a comedy, there are lots of LOL moments, but it's also a great story, with hugely compelling and interesting characters, and the acting is fantastic. By the time the season is over, you have a real kinship with many of the characters, they all have depth, including the main character who most people seem to dislike, but I think that's kind of the point. She's going through a morphing process. Finding out who she really is. Prison is removing the yuppie veneer one step at a time. It's really great television, right up there with the best. Makes you wonder why it isn't the show everyone is talking about and House of Cards is?" created="Mon, 17 Feb 2014 17:51:28 GMT"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/whatsComingInFargo2.html&quot;&gt;Fargo 2&lt;/a&gt;, the next version of Fargo, is in beta, and pretty close to release. The major change in this release is the CMS isn't in the server, it's in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.staticapps.org/articles/defining-static-web-apps&quot;&gt;static app&lt;/a&gt; that runs on the user's desktop.   " created="Sun, 09 Feb 2014 19:54:30 GMT"/>

				<outline text="In the traditional model for content management, Model #1 in the diagram, most of the hard work is done on the server and there's a lightweight client written in JavaScript, that runs in the browser. The client assists the user in navigating a menu system for setting options and editing articles and images. Examples of apps that work this way are WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, Ghost, basically most blogging and content management software. " created="Sun, 02 Feb 2014 16:48:03 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Because the heavy lifting is done on the server, and it's managing lots of users' sites, the servers are expensive. Huge data centers, with air conditioning and staff. " created="Sun, 02 Feb 2014 16:49:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="A different model has always been possible, Model #2 above. My earlier company, UserLand, pioneered this with Radio UserLand in January 2002. It put the heart of the CMS on the user's machine, in a separate app you had to download and install. At the time there was no &quot;cloud&quot; for us to tap into, no Amazon S3 or EC2, or Dropbox, for us to leverage. But it worked! Radio was a popular product, even though the user was running a little server on their desktop (and most had no idea they were). " created="Sun, 02 Feb 2014 16:51:17 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Today we can do even better, because the browser running JavaScript is a very powerful environment. Installing a CMS on your machine can be done simply by loading a page. No software to install. It's really amazing when you think about it. (But not so amazing if you think how long it took to get here.)" created="Sun, 02 Feb 2014 17:03:09 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Model #2 has very little downside today compared to 2002. The cloud is ubiquitous and reliable. The software runs in the browser, no app to install. And today's machines are hugely powerful and can  render a modest size website in a second or less (really). It's fast. " created="Sun, 02 Feb 2014 17:07:41 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The big win in doing it this way is that you can have a much richer interface for editing and managing content, because the work is distributed. As a result in Fargo 2, you can edit a whole website in a single outline. This is a first, a breakthrough. (I've been working toward this since starting my blog almost 20 years ago.)" created="Sun, 09 Feb 2014 20:03:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The new Fargo does almost all the work that a server-based CMS such as WordPress and Tumblr does. It relies on a tiny public component, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/fargoPublisher&quot;&gt;Fargo Publisher&lt;/a&gt;, which has been released under the MIT license. The protocol it uses is open, so other back-ends can be implemented, and other &quot;static&quot; software like Fargo can use it to help the user publish their work. I will document the protocol when it settles down, which will happen soon. " created="Sun, 02 Feb 2014 16:56:28 GMT"/>

People actually said out loud that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/nixon-transcript/?flavour=mobile&quot;&gt;specific women&lt;/a&gt; were saints, esp when they were probably the opposite.

Then come the stories! What a trip. I've seen it up close at rare moments when I was in the middle of competitive women. It was nice to have the attention, but I quickly understood it wasn't about me. I was being used as a pawn in politics between women.

				<outline text="Git stores your source code in a repository. This contains all your files, their history, your commit messages, etc."/>
				<outline text="Repositories come in two flavors:">
					<outline text="Local repositories. These look like ordinary directories of source code, but they contain a hidden &quot;.git&quot; directory with all your history and metadata. For example, when we run &quot;git init&quot; in fargoCounters, it creates a directory &quot;fargoCounters/.git&quot; and fills it with various things."/>
					<outline text="Remote repositories. These are basically a bare version of your &quot;.git&quot; directory, without a surrounding directory full of source code. By convention, these are named something like &quot;fargoCounters.git&quot;, and they typically live on a server somewhere. You can have any number of remote repositories: maybe none, maybe one on GitHub, maybe a bunch."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="When you &quot;commit&quot; changes, they go into your local repository."/>
				<outline text="When you &quot;push&quot; changes, it takes the changes that were committed to your local repository and copies them to a remote repository. When you &quot;pull&quot; changes, you copy from a remote repository into your local repository. Using push and pull, you could move code around between several remote repositories, which is very useful for a team. For example, I could create my own fargoPublisher repository will a bunch of changes, and you could &quot;pull&quot; from my remote repository to your local repository, and then (if you like the changes), you could &quot;push&quot;  them to your repositories on GitHub and Heroku. "/>
				<outline text="Heroku basically acts like a magic remote repository for your app. You commit changes to your local repository, and push them to Heroku using 'git push heroku master'. But unlike a regular remote repository, when Heroku receives your changes, it automatically recompiles your app, deploys it to a server, and restarts your app using the new code."/>
				<outline text="Git is frankly a pain in the ass, but once you finally get used to it, it's pretty nice, because it makes it easy to share changes. And GitHub is excellent. In a perfect world, git would be easier to understand, but our world is definitely imperfect. And on the bright side, at least git is standard in the Node.js and Ruby communities, so you only need to figure it out once and then you can use it for all kinds of stuff. It's better to have once slightly ugly solution that everybody uses than to have 37 different solutions that lock in the users."/>

It was then that I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcm.com/&quot;&gt;Turner Classic Movies&lt;/a&gt;. I had cable service, but never had enough time to look through all the channels.

In her first talking movie, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Revue_of_1929&quot;&gt;in 1929&lt;/a&gt;, she sang and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3tAsM_tMRQ&quot;&gt;danced&lt;/a&gt; and smiled, she was so cute and charming and young. In 1932, she played a girl stranded on a Pacific island, victimized by other people's morality in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_(1932_film)&quot;&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt;. Also in 1932, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Hotel_(film)&quot;&gt;Grand Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, she plays a secretary who is seduced by a seedy old married dude. In 1939, she played a leading role in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Women_(1939_film)&quot;&gt;The Women&lt;/a&gt;, which had a cast of women only. No men. They talk about the men, fight over them, divorce them, remarry, all of that, without any men on screen or with lines. She plays the woman that all the other women hate. The beginning of the Crawford persona. In the 40s she developed into a business person in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(film)&quot;&gt;Mildred Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, and many other characters. I think her last great movie was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Ever_Happened_to_Baby_Jane%3F_(film)&quot;&gt;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&lt;/a&gt;, with Bette Davis.

				<outline text="Whether Crawford abused her daughter or not, to me, is not connected to her work as an actor. Abuse isn't something that exists in a vacuum. Who was the victim? I have no idea. Each generation tries to do the best they can, but the gifts of previous generations can be hard to overcome. Where does the blame start? And what if Crawford's daughter was taking advantage of her dead mother, who wasn't able to tell her side of it? If we want to stop abuse, imho, the best thing we can do is all of us become conscious and develop a deep sense of fairness, and practice it, systematically, and without passion. Step back and take a deep breath, and stop treating people as symbols, and you'll be doing a lot to stop abuse. " created="Thu, 06 Feb 2014 14:35:24 GMT"/>

The young woman, played by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariel_Hemingway&quot;&gt;Mariel Hemingway&lt;/a&gt;, provided a perfect foil for the childishness of the adults. She was kind, thoughtful, cared about herself. I thought she was a role model for how someone should conduct themselves in love. She gets the last word, and leaves Woody standing at the door of her apartment, realizing it's time for him to grow up. Now don't get confused about whose words are whose -- that's Woody Allen speaking through the young Ms Hemingway. He's talking about himself to himself.

				<outline text="I've been thinking about Microsoft for a long time. My first visit there was in 1981, when the IBM/Microsoft PC was about to come out. I was aware of the machine because I worked at a software company that was in the loop. I was blown away by the possibility of a machine with 640K of memory! Up till then, the most I had to work with was 48K on an Apple II. 64K if you had a &quot;language card.&quot; " created="Wed, 05 Feb 2014 16:37:48 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Back then Microsoft wasn't the center of the software world, but they did eventually, briefly become that, in the early-mid 1990s. But the Internet proved to be too complex a competitor. Their efforts to dominate it, to turn the Web into a feature of Office, were doomed to fail. And it's only gotten worse, as they lost their Windows dominance of the desktop because they failed to respond to the malware crisis of the mid-2000's. The bad news didn't end there, as they tried to morph Windows into a tablet operating system. It became an inadequate desktop OS and an unacceptable tablet OS. " created="Wed, 05 Feb 2014 16:49:23 GMT"/>
				<outline text="For Microsoft to get back in the game, they have to return to an earlier playbook, when they weren't dominant in anything. They must recognize technology that has momentum, independent of Microsoft, and invest in it. When another technology comes along, one that gains momentum on its own, repeat the investment. Buy stock in promising startups. Microsoft can profit from the growth of the market, but they must not try to make their own efforts dominant.

If any of that is true, I would like to urge you not to give into that kind of thinking! The market has spoken, there's a lot of development energy going into Node. You could even say it's the consensus &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; for server development going forward.

				<outline text="I touched on this yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/28/#a1396023669&quot;&gt;writing about Cosmos&lt;/a&gt; and evolution, and how I had the feeling that I wanted to &quot;Do that!&quot; -- when thinking about evolution. I know this may sound weird but I think we're not just subject to evolution, but we are also agents of evolution. In other words, evolution acts through us. Things we do intuitively are in the service of evolution. It's obviously true for some things, like sex -- that to us seems like an act of pleasure, at another level it's about procreating, and at yet another level it's about competition between our genes to form or influence the next generation of humans. But I think there's an even higher level of service, that our intellectual creativity is an evolutionary process as well.

				<outline text="If you look at the evolution of programming languages, you'll see a parental lineage going back to &quot;the beginning.&quot; Algol borrowed ideas from Fortran, and C and Pascal from Algol, and Python, JavaScript are also Algol-like. I'm sure this is partially because the designers of the languages grew up using the predecessors. It's why our habits in America are familiar to Europeans and others probably to Africans and Asians, because our ancestors brought their familiar ways with them when they emigrated. Why should they change just because they live on a different continent? Same with languages. If &quot;while&quot; meant something in one language, it's not very useful if it means something else in a new language." created="Sat, 29 Mar 2014 15:40:48 GMT"/>
				<outline text="But there's another reason for a language to make small evolutionary changes relative to the languages that came before -- it's because they arrive in an environment that must be ready to use them. Languages that depart radically from prior art will have a hard time getting uptake because they are familiar to no one. That's why change is necessarily gradual. It's why we still use QWERTY keyboards instead of a superior design." created="Sat, 29 Mar 2014 15:43:40 GMT"/>
				<outline text="One of the most striking ideas in Cosmos, and a new one to me, is that evolution never goes back and re-invents something. Once there's a basic design for an eye, Tyson teaches, all eyes from then on work that way. This was less than optimal, he says, because eyes evolved when animals only lived under water. Because our eyes are largely made of water, there is distortion when they're used in air that isn't present in water. Basically fish have better vision than birds, reptiles and mammals. Why can't evolution go back and re-do the design of eyes now that they are used in air? I don't understand, but I find the idea fascinating. " created="Sat, 29 Mar 2014 15:45:18 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, I think we'd do better if we were more careful about discontinuity in software environments. More people want to use computers in a mobile context today. Why does that mean that our languages have to change? Apple's C-based language is no better or worse than JavaScript, yet there are significant differences in the languages, ones that are difficult if not impossible to factor into a common interface. It means that change comes at a price, we lose capabilities we had before, unnecessarily, just because we want to use iPhones in addition to Macs. " created="Sat, 29 Mar 2014 15:47:51 GMT"/>
				<outline text="It would all work better, imho, if we used natural evolution to form basic principles for software evolution. That developers not place so much emphasis on changing the world, and more on careful and thoughtful evolution. Only steal from the best, is a very good design principle, imho -- as well as Postel's Law -- strive to interop, of course, but also strive to make interop easy.

				<outline text="A point that's very hard to make on the Internet, even if you tiptoe up to it, is that employers are people too, and they make decisions the way all people do, with a lot of input from lawyers and public opinion of course. As I said in the piece, if that story took place in 2014 instead of 1985, public opinion would have been a much larger factor. And, age discrimination, which was the subject of the story, today, is just beginning to be a topic of public concern. " created="Tue, 25 Mar 2014 13:05:44 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Today ageism is prevalent. A lot of the abuse I took in response to that piece was ageist. For whatever reason this is a form of hate that is openly tolerated. We all get to deal with this one, if you live long enough, so there's some satisfaction in knowing that at some point people who hurt others based on age will learn what it feels like to be on the receiving end. However, it would be better if it just stopped, of course. ;-)" created="Tue, 25 Mar 2014 13:32:25 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I don't remember writing the paragraph that caused so much fury, it was at the end of a long piece. I write much as if I were giving a talk at a conference, with a light edit after the first pass. But reading the words in the paragraph, clearly I anticipated abuse, because I disclaimed exactly what people accused me of. It would ridiculous for me to advocate age discrimination, not only because I am exactly the opposite kind of person who does that (for good reason, I did eight years of therapy to understand why I am like this) but also because at 58, I deal with a lot of ageism myself. No matter, the howlers found their handle, and they howled away, all kind of nasty shit -- fiction -- about who I am. It's okay -- I'm used to it, because I've been blogging now for almost 20 years. " created="Tue, 25 Mar 2014 13:09:06 GMT"/>
				<outline text="It's okay, but in another way it's totally not okay. According a few very controlling people there's only one set of opinions that are valid. It's taboo to say that an employer who feels unjustly penalized might avoid risk and try to hire people who couldn't make claims of discrimination. It's obviously true if you just think a little. What happens in press releases and legal filings isn't always exactly what happens in the minds of people making the decisions. " created="Tue, 25 Mar 2014 13:12:13 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Fact: Some portion of the wrongful termination suits &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; scams. Maybe it's a very low percentage. I doubt if anyone knows, because we're not allowed to discuss it in public. I do know that in this one case, the only time I've had to deal with this, it was a scam. Every time someone points a finger, no matter what the howlers on the Internet say, all reasonable people wonder if the accusations are true. If a friend is accused of sexual harassment, for example, someone you know and trust, and they swear they didn't do it, would there be no doubt? If not, then we're giving too much power to people to ruin the lives of others. Because sometimes there is harassment, and other times it goes the other way, the abuse flows from the accuser to the accused. " created="Tue, 25 Mar 2014 13:15:16 GMT"/>
				<outline text="These things are discussed privately all the time. I believe in opening up discourse, that's why I deliberately challenge these limits. If there's a truth that's taboo, I'm the kind of person who &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; to talk about it in public. We're at a point in human evolution where we desperately need to be truthful with ourselves. A small number of people controlling everyone else, preventing them from speaking, that's exactly the wrong direction for us to be going in. " created="Tue, 25 Mar 2014 13:17:57 GMT"/>

In writing these posts I've heard from a lot of people, including people whose blogs I used to read, before they stopped updating them. There are lots of reasons they stopped. One reason you hear a lot is they couldn't stand the verbal beating they took for writing publicly. For whatever reason, Facebook is a safer place to talk with people in a friendly way. That's too bad, because Facebook is a corporate thing. Their algorithms choose what you read in a way that's optimized to make them money, and we've learned lately, provide information about us to the government.

People who, in the name of standing up for one group say that I'm a terrible person because I belong to a group they don't like (white, male, over-50, maybe some of it is anti-semitism, though they generally aren't open about that). I have women friends who blog who were attacked because they are women. I'm sure everyone gets it from some group who have decided they are bad. Democrats get it from Republicans, Republicans from Democrats (yes, I know Dems think they're all sweetness and light, but that's not true).

But then others should produce a summary of the problem, in dispassionate bullet points, so that everyone else can form an opinion. And then a strict rule would be enforced, anyone who comments is free to do so without attack. That would help us identify real issues, and would help people get over the fear they have, and it's pervasive and chilling, to say what they think, but are scared to do so because they fear being attacked.

Without any history to use against them. The ideas stand alone, not pinned to a gender or race or status. It's really amazing how quickly you can cut through the bullshit with a little real anonymity. Some people write it off, thinking it's too easy to use to attack people with impunity (and that's very true, it can). But the same mechanism can be used to tell the attackers to fuck off. I've seen this, first-hand, and it made me laugh out loud to see something you &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; see in the public web, people talking back to bullies!

In doing so I'd incur hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills, would spend days in depositions and in court, and I'd still have to pay. I could fight, because he was ripping us off -- or I could pay, and move on. Of course I chose to pay. No one in business, where you're fighting fires all the time, wants to take on an optional fight that has negative upside. If I did that, I would have been pushed aside by the board, and they would have been right to do it. You run a company to do great things and make money.

But we've gone so much further in the intervening 12 years. Metaweblog views each post as a document, but Fargo views a whole website as a document.

" created="Mon, 03 Mar 2014 18:01:08 GMT"/>
				<outline text="4. We need a word for what we do because it is an important activity. You can't understand how news works today without understanding the role that bloggers play. So in a sense professional reporters hurt themselves by usurping a term that meant something before they applied it to themselves. " created="Mon, 03 Mar 2014 18:08:56 GMT"/>
				<outline text="5. Why are bloggers important to reporters? Bloggers are your sources. They are the people who previous generations of reporters had to reach by telephone. These days reporters can skim hundreds of perspectives on the web, prioritized by search engines. The reach of reporters in the age of blogging is far greater that it was in the age of the telephone. Understanding this synergy is key to understanding how news will evolve in the future. " created="Mon, 03 Mar 2014 18:04:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="6. But the real reason to let amateurs have this word is it's the right thing to do. It's fair. Reporters already have a word to describe what they do. Let us keep ours. " created="Mon, 03 Mar 2014 18:06:04 GMT"/>

Here's a list of ideas the next-layer-up will have. " created="Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:19:10 GMT"/>
				<outline text="1. The basic unit shouldn't be a CPU, it should be an app. They are like the apps that run on your iPhone, but they run on a server, not on a hand-held device." created="Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:19:51 GMT"/>

To create a new app, click a button called New App. A dialog appears, asking what template I want to use (by template I mean GitHub repository, but that's something designers/programmers worry about). A configuration dialog appears, one created by the template designer. Checkboxes, text areas etc. These set the environment variables that configure the app. " created="Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:21:49 GMT"/>
				<outline text="4. Storage is handled in a simplified S3-like store, without the quirks of S3. Static, web-accessible storage. Nicely configurable with user dialogs. Works like a file system and a web server. And it has an interactive mode that works like a file system (after all these years S3 still doesn't have one, because it's basically not possible)." created="Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:34:38 GMT"/>
				<outline text="5. Double-click on an app to get a readout of what it's doing. Something like the Google Analytics dashboard pops up. I can see what kind of traffic it's getting. Look at how it's doing with its resources. Is a database filling up? Is response time okay? Has it been up continuously. This is what people who run server apps want to be able to see at a glance." created="Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:20:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="6. If I want to add more resources, steal the slider from Heroku (see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/20/whyIHeartHeroku.html&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt;). The more resources the app uses, the more you pay. In times of peak load scale it up. When things quiet down, you can slide it back down. " created="Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:23:05 GMT"/>

				<outline text="2. Then we have to enlist the help of users in discovering those servers. "/>
				<outline text="3. A simple feature added quickly to all the major browsers that lights up when you're on a server that's not secure. And that event goes into a database, and that information is quickly shared with the owner of the system, when they can be located (some are not going to be easily located)."/>
				<outline text="4. Then again, if we had some leadership we could just isolate those systems. Cut them off the net, so that they themselves can be damaged, but they can't be used themselves to cause damage. Again I'm sure we're falling behind the bad guys as we speak. Of course they aren't running press releases. That's probably the major reason the press isn't carrying any of the urgent messages that need to get out there."/>
				<outline text="5. A Kickstarter project, that was immediately funded to do this work would be a good sign. Then we have to get the Netcraft people involved, and Schneier, and maybe a few other organizations that are good at communicating with programmers -- O'Reilly, the developer programs at the big tech companies -- Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter, Oracle, IBM, Salesforce, etc. Stack Exchange, Hacker News, Slashdot.

				<outline text="6. The goal is to develop a communication system, quickly, to help locate and fix the vulnerable systems. And then brace for what comes next. "/>

I smiled when I saw the MetaWeblog API calls from the late 90s in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baalexander/node-xmlrpc&quot;&gt;node.js wrapper&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="I don't have any early-days memories of Facebook, because I wasn't part of its early adopter crowd. But I was there for the beginning of Twitter. And I remember what an eye-opening experience it was. All of a sudden the lives of the people I related to on the web were opening up to me. I could see where people go, even learn about their families. But then the experience got diluted, as I followed more people, and more people, strangers, talked to me as I tweeted. The experience re-formed into a sort of social media haze, people promoting this and that. Although we don't call it spam, that's really what most of what's on Twitter is.

Father and Son, by Cat Stevens. (It was Father's Day.) I had just heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q29YR5-t3gg&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; on the radio, and wanted to hear it again. Back then, if you can believe it, this was a problem. Unless I had a song in my personal collection of CDs I had bought at a record store, the best I could do was wait until it came on the radio again. Then I had a thought -- maybe it's on Napster. It was. That, and everything else. In the period between my first and second visits, the system had boomed with people of my age, and now our music was there too. It was an amazing experience to be able to browse old tunes the way I browsed the web. I wrote about it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+napster&quot;&gt;a lot&lt;/a&gt;. The experience of music had been transformed.

				<outline text="For this howto we may need up to four ingredients from a feed item: title, link, description, guid. When displaying the item, we need up to two bits: headline and body. Depending on what's in the item, the headline might link to something, or just be bare text linking to nothing. " created="Mon, 07 Apr 2014 16:28:35 GMT"/>
				<outline text="#### How to" created="Mon, 07 Apr 2014 16:31:49 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If the item has a title, the headline is the title. " created="Mon, 07 Apr 2014 16:31:59 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If the item has no title, but has a description, the headline is the first N characters of the description. The value of N is up to you, based on how you lay the items out on a page, or if it's a river. In this case the body is empty. We've already used the description once. This is where a few aggregators repeat the text. There's no need to do this, it's unsightly, confusing, and shows lack of care for the reader." created="Mon, 07 Apr 2014 16:40:04 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The headline usually links to something. If the item has a link element, the headline links to that. If it has a guid, but no link and the guid is a permalink, the headline links to the guid. If it has no link, no guid, or the guid is not a permalink, then the headline is bare text, it's not an anchor element." created="Mon, 07 Apr 2014 16:34:22 GMT"/>

They're talking about the future, and Pacino, the coach, the older guy explains that the great thing about football isn't any of the things people think it is. It's the comradeship, the being part of a cause, working with other people you love, on things you believe in. It's about the people you work with more than anything.

				<outline text="I had learned in the past that you don't hire people based on their résumés. Instead, put out an invitation, and see who shows up. That's one reason open source projects are so useful. I think every serious programmer should be part of one, and every university should sponsor one. Because they attract a lot of people, and you get to try working with all of them. And if there's someone you work with very well, and no one really understands why this happens, then just work with them. Don't question the logic of it, go with the flow." created="Sun, 25 May 2014 12:04:02 GMT"/>
				<outline text="That's why I, as Brent says, &quot;gave him a chance.&quot; It wasn't really like that. I already knew we worked well together. So we just kept working together. For a bunch of years. I would always be happy to work with Brent on something, it really doesn't matter what. And I still start open source projects hoping to find more people like Brent I can work with. It's helpful if you already know computer science concepts, but we can work with any skill set, as long as you have intelligence, drive, a sense of humor, and a reasonable desire to be perfect (as in we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html&quot;&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; shitty software, and know this version has bugs but it's shipping)." created="Sun, 25 May 2014 12:05:58 GMT"/>

Specifically, it's the realization of the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt;, one of the pieces Brent left out of his list, interestingly. Possibly because that's the project where I met Andre Radke, another one of the guys who joined our team. Clay Basket's idea was that you could use the same outline you use to write the documents and the code to organize the site. It was a good idea then, but now it really works. All these ideas take time. That's another big lesson. There's a continuous stream of trying ideas out, learning from the experience, and feeding that back into the next effort." created="Sun, 25 May 2014 12:07:03 GMT" img="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/05/25/siteScriptedWithFrontier.gif"/>

It may not use the most recent internal technology of the Mac OS, but I don't know or care. It works just as well on today's Macs as it did on the ones that we used when Brent moved on.

				<outline text="Because I'm always reading it, maybe that's why it's so disturbing to see all the chaos behind the curtain at the Times. It sounds like it's falling apart. That's not great. And then it occurs to me that the entire news industry has been heading to this cliff, almost as if they figure at the end they'll get a reprieve. Perhaps government funding, or an idea will come from nowhere and magically save the day. That's not a good plan. I've seen people try that, and it generally doesn't work, in real life.

				<outline text="I wonder why they don't move more in the direction everything is going? As soon as Twitter proved they had a good mechanism for news delivery, which was an idea that was available to everyone, every news organization should have started their own experiment (because Twitter always has been just an experiment, maybe the news people don't see that). It's still not too late, and there's nothing to lose. Let's remake the NYT home page as a river. It will work a lot better than the current home page, and it will also attract interest from the world. And it can be iterated in so many ways. Not just technically but with content. Rivers should be seen as editorial products. A news organization should create a river just like they create an editorial workflow. It's the equivalent of that, but on the visible side of the curtain. " created="Fri, 16 May 2014 06:48:44 GMT"/>

Blogging doesn't eliminate what reporters do, but it changes it. Now, instead of making five phone calls to find out what experts think, you can do a search, read a bunch of posts, and then write.

				<outline text="2. I don't think this is the problem to solve. What both news organizations need to do, have needed to do since the web took off 20 years ago, is find a way to get the expertise of their sources to flow directly through their publications. In the mid-late 90s this could have quickly and easily been accomplished by hosting a reliable blogging platform. Then, as your reporters do their jobs, they would have a much bigger array of expertise to tap, better organized, and the volume and quality of their work would go up.

Read what they write, and share it with your readers. This will immediately have huge influence on the both the blogosphere that you include and the ones you don't. Include your competitors.

				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Dave Winer: We can’t live in a world that doesn’t have Facebook&lt;/b&gt;" created="Wed, 18 Jun 2014 11:07:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="One of the most influential web personalities talks about the web, social networks and the NSA scandal"/>
				<outline text="Trieste – Dave Winer has been defined in many ways: “The father of blogging and of feed readers”, “One of the most important people for the evolution of online media”, one of the 25 most influential people on the web, according to Fortune. Still, as I meet him at State of the Net in Trieste for a chat about the influence of new technologies on journalism and democracy, you get the feeling that you’re not really dealing with a “guru”, but rather with a person who likes to think out loud, provoke and mix considerations that are the result of years of experience and sudden intuitions."/>
				<outline text="Winer, in short, is the incarnation of his idea of information as a stream that is constant and bare, without filters or mediation. As Jeff Jarvis wrote back in 2006 describing his project – which is still up-to-date, as we’ll see – related to “rivers of news”. “Just news, sir, and let it flow”. Honesty allows Winer to go beyond being politically correct, something that ruins many interviews; soft tones, thinking that even if you don’t necessarily agree on a conclusion, preconditions ought to be taken into consideration."/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;At State of the Net you defined yourself as a software developer: “Every morning, when I wake up, I write code”. But the code you’ve written, and are currently writing, has also changed the way we understand the ecosystem of information and of online conversations.&lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“I make tools. But I’m not only a programmer: the best term for what I do I believe is ‘media hacker’. There are a lot more possibilities with media now than there have been for the past few decades, and so the question is: what combinations of media actually work, and which don’t? It’s a process involving experimentation, learning, feedback, verification. Sometimes you try an idea out and it doesn’t work, and a few years later it does, because the environment is different.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Can you give us an example?&lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“Podcasting. We experimented with this for the first time at the beginning of 2001 and nothing particular happened. Maybe someone read about it, but it wasn’t understood. We continued for a few years to try approaching the tool in new ways, until in 2004 it began to work. Before that moment it wouldn’t have happened, in part because we made it look like it was hard to do and should have made it look easy. Also, in 2004 there was iPod, while there wasn’t in 2001. And so we started working with Chris Liebing [Lydon] at NPR: he was great, we did a whole series together. They became very popular. Then I did one myself, and suddenly everyone started to copy me. Which was fine, because getting everybody to do it was what I was trying to achieve.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Today, what would you try to “get everybody to do” in journalism? &lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“A lot of things. One that I have persistently tried to get people do is to operate ‘rivers’. A ‘river’ collects all of a reader’s blogs and information sources and aggregates them into a news flow. I believe that many newspapers are not systematic in the way they consume news. And for many readers if a story isn’t on Twitter it doesn’t exist. But it isn’t true. There are a lot of things out there that we don’t read about and from which we would benefit. This is part one. Part two is that newspapers themselves could share their ‘rivers’ with readers. For you Wired people, for example, they would include the blogs that are Wired-like, what your reporters are reading, what influences them. It would have an impact on readers and on the editorial line. Over time, the flow would build up, and it would maybe end up being the biggest single change that any single newspaper can do. Many, however, do not want to use it because it would end up competing with the writers. ‘It would cut our own throat’, they say. But in the long term their throats will be cut anyway so you might as well capture the change and do it in a creative way. And think about where all this could lead because it’s only a first step and we don’t know which others might follow.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Can you give us an example of an editorial project that you think is innovative?&lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“Quartz, which has implemented my outliner, Fargo. It’s a very innovative organization, managed by brilliant people. But ‘innovation’ and ‘news’ are two words that I don’t usually put together. What’s certainly true is that a lot of editorial projects like to define themselves as innovative: Vox, for example.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight?&lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“Ah, he’s great. Since he left The New York Times I haven’t been following him closely, though. But he’ll be back in the limelight for midterm elections in the United States, later this year. What he says about experts is terribly true: they’re only filling space, they have no insight. They’re talking about their own opinions, not about what the public thinks, which has a no value whatsoever. I just stopped paying attention to that kind of journalism.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;And how is technological journalism doing? &lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“I think it’s very mediocre. More than anything else, it’s about money: it matters more than technology. And this is definitely hurting technology. The problem is that we don’t have a way to spread information about things that are really new: I do them all the time, and don’t get any coverage. When I launched Little Porkchop - a program that allows you to translate posts exceeding 140 characters in planned series of tweets, which are numbered and sent automatically at a rate of one per second - a few weeks ago, I got a lot of coverage, but because it’s about Twitter and because it’s controversial. I didn’t know, when I wrote it, that it wasn’t going to be considered an improvement in the use of Twitter. But I don’t care.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Still here in Trieste you said that blogging platforms ought to be updated. How? &lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“Fargo is my most concise statement of how blogging ought to be updated. At the beginning the basic idea was to make it easier to edit a page: making your changes, hitting a button, submitting them. It wasn’t obvious at all, we had to work to get there. But there is much more to blogs and to websites then just a page. On WordPress to get from one post to another you have to exit the post, move to the next, choose to edit it... and in the meantime, you’ve completely lost the possibility to edit the previous one.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;And instead?&lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“You can build a website editor such as Fargo that will enable you to change every piece of text without having to switch contexts, without having to navigate anywhere: just put the cursor over the text, click, expand it, make your changes, then close it up. That is where we’re going to go. If there’s any health at all to the technology industry, there will be a complete rewrite of how blogging software works, and that will be the basic idea: to view a whole website in a single document. But the leading blogging platforms aren’t paying any attention whatsoever, same for the press. Quartz is using it, but you can see it. Instead, the result ought to be invisible, a natural reading experience, seamless.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Another thing from your speech at State of the Net, on Facebook: “We can’t do anything about it, it’s like time”. In accordance with the same logic we might say: “We can’t do anything against digital mass surveillance, it’s like time.” [Note: I think I said it's like weather, not time.]&lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“We can’t live in a world without Facebook. And we can’t live in a world without mass surveillance: I don’t think there is a way out. If I stood up and said, ‘Hey, NSA, stop spying on us!’, what effect would that have? None. Sure, it’s terrible that our government can’t control itself, but they were caught with their hands in our affairs and they’re not doing anything about it. And I don’t know what it takes. Snowden might have thought, and the rest of us might have thought, that once exposed there would be mass outrage. But there wasn’t, and I don’t think there will be. "/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Snowden says that the solution is technological: encryption. &lt;/b&gt;"/>
				<outline text="“I don’t think so. If there were a technological solution, they would outlaw it. I believe that as of now we are living on the brink of fascism, on a worldwide basis. And the illusion that we had in the early days of the Web, that we’d broken free, was just that, an illusion. Governments were happy to let us believe that: why interfere with the illusion of freedom? And if we ever tried to do anything to get out of the prison they’ve put us in, then they’ll clamp down, and then we’ll really feel the weight of the fascism. The thing is that I don’t think there is a memory anymore of how bad that can be. Of course, I’m sure they remember in East Germany. But the United States had flirted with fascism in the McCarthy era, without ever really going beyond that. My grandfather had warned me about this, he explained to me exactly what fascism was. He told me that it nearly destroyed his life: during the war he had to escape from Eastern Europe to save his life. I realized back then how awful it is to live in a repressive society, and I think that if you think that the penalty for crossing a government is that kind of repression, then you already live in it: it’s already dominating you. And I believe that we’ve already there. Here in the U.S. we thought we were solving the problem by electing Obama. Nothing could be further from the truth: Obama is just a tool of whatever is really running our lives. We have to do our best with what we have, and I think none of us has enough power to stop all this.”"/>
				<outline text="&lt;b&gt;It’s hard to still believe in an open and free internet, with these premises. &lt;/b&gt;"/>

				<outline text="The tech industry has a set of questions that are really talking points that &quot;prove&quot; that there's no reason to support RSS in publishing products.

				<outline text="Most people on the Internet don't use JSON and have never heard of it. So by Abrams' calculation it doesn't matter either. But it does very much matter! The last few steps in the process of getting news from reporters to readers involves publishing it as either JSON or HTML. It's pretty much got to be one or the other. How many of those people even know what JSON or HTML are? Probably very few. No one is losing any sleep over this. Or sponsoring public service campaigns to educate people on the importance of JSON. It's not a huge problem. " created="Thu, 24 Jul 2014 13:12:47 GMT"/>

So I decided to see what would happen if I lit it on fire. Bad idea. The tiny little coffee can with a tiny little bit of gasoline in it exploded! Made a huge sound and I felt it all over my body.

It was late at night and I had no idea where the problem was in the system I was working on. We had a timesharing facility in New Jersey. The problem could be there. It could be in the communication link between us (this was 1977, that was an function that programmers had to worry about). Or it could be somewhere in the office on the 39th floor.

				<outline text="A short piece, with an important distinction." created="Tue, 15 Jul 2014 15:22:55 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Reading this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/nyregion/blog-sites-sheepshead-bites-and-bensonhurst-bean-merge.html&quot;&gt;NY Times piece&lt;/a&gt; about Brooklyn blogs, I was struck by two things." created="Tue, 15 Jul 2014 15:23:08 GMT"/>
				<outline text="1. When blogs merge, they immediately stop being blogs. It's not an individual effort anymore, and that's the crucial part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/06/27/iKnowWhatABlogIs.html&quot;&gt;being a blog&lt;/a&gt;, it has to be the voice of a person, not an organization. Yes, you can have blogs inside news organizations, Krugman is a great example of that. But the NY Times, where his blog posts appear, is not a blog because of that." created="Tue, 15 Jul 2014 15:23:26 GMT"/>
				<outline text="2. The Times is, in my experience, unable to write about blogs with respect. They've been diminutive, dismissive, condescending. I'm sure there are exceptions, I haven't read every story at the NYT about blogs. But I've never read a piece about blogs and came away from it thinking, hey that was insightful, I really learned something there. Mostly what I learn is that the Times, collectively, is scared of blogs. It really shows. " created="Tue, 15 Jul 2014 15:25:06 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Is this like two basketball players being dismissive of each other, something you almost never hear? Usually it's the opposite, they pump up the competition. Why? Well it's good sportmanship, for one thing. It also shows you're not scared of them, because respect indicates the opposite of fear. It also sets expectations. If they are great, then you really accomplished something. A classic example of win-win." created="Tue, 15 Jul 2014 15:26:45 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Blogs are the sources of journalists, going &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;directly&lt;/a&gt; to the readers. And that's how blogging creates competition, by unbundling what journalists do, making it possible for information-seekers to go straight to the sources, without an intermediary. And when the intermediary adds so much noise to the story, why not go around them? " created="Tue, 15 Jul 2014 15:28:30 GMT"/>
				<outline text="So blogs are close to being competition for pros. So it would be smart to stop the snark, and try to understand why blogs are useful to you, and the readers, and show &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule&quot;&gt;appropriate&lt;/a&gt; respect. Reporters make a mistake in thinking blogs are somehow lesser than they are. We are a part of what they do, when things are working smoothly. And we provide an alternative to what they do, when they are not. " created="Tue, 15 Jul 2014 15:33:07 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The point is really simple. I'm a software developer. I decided that's what I wanted to do when I was in my late teens, early 20s. I never ask myself why I do it. When it clicked for me at that young age, it was like it probably is for a person who plays tennis professionally, or who plays in a band. We don't question the point of them doing what they do, so why do people question what I do?" created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 14:37:47 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I've been doing it all along. Only now people can see it. Because the platform I'm working on is one that almost everyone uses. It took a lot of effort to get here, I had to give up a lot of good work to do it. But it was worth it." created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 14:45:19 GMT"/>
				<outline text="To me, it's gratifying to have people use my software and for me to hear what they want, the walls they hit, so I can see how to evolve it. That's data, and it informs my work. These are puzzles that I love. To me software is a performing art. I do it even if I'm the only one using the software. But it's much much better if there are others. The more, the better.

			<outline text="Why the Facebook API works better for me" created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:26:28 GMT" isFeedItem="true" name="whyTheFacebookApiWorksBetterForMe" type="outline">
				<outline text="Yesterday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/07/07/comparingApis.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; that compared the APIs of Twitter and Facebook. I said it took 3 months to do with Twitter what took 4 days with Facebook, but I didn't say &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it was so much easier with Facebook. Mea culpa! " created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:26:47 GMT"/>
				<outline text="1. First, it's important to know that I'm developing in JavaScript in the browser. " created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:27:46 GMT"/>
				<outline text="2. If I don't have to write server software then it goes much more quickly." created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:28:11 GMT"/>
				<outline text="3. With Twitter, I can't call directly to their API from the browser. I have to write an intermediate server app that calls on my behalf, and call that. " created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:28:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="4. So I create a server app, and a simple interface for my JavaScript code running in the browser. That's what took the 3 months. I had to work in another environment, Node.js. I was still coding in JavaScript, and I already had a couple of projects under my belt in Node, so while some of the 3 months was spent learning Node, I already knew how to build Node-based server apps when I started." created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:29:07 GMT"/>
				<outline text="5. Why it was faster: No need to write that server app for Facebook. They did all the work. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/08/28/programmingPhilosophyModularize&quot;&gt;factoring&lt;/a&gt;, and it works much like factoring in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/multiplying-factoring-expression&quot;&gt;algebra&lt;/a&gt;. By the time I saw their API it had a simple in-browser JavaScript interface, that works more or less like the one I built for Twitter, for myself. That's why I &lt;i&gt;zoooooomed&lt;/i&gt; through the Facebook project. :heart_eyes_cat:" created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:30:24 GMT"/>
				<outline text="6. Another advantage of the Facebook approach (which is also used by Dropbox, and recently by Amazon web services) is that because I don't have to run a server, I don't have to buy more server resources if my app becomes popular. They take care of the scaling for me. Which seems fair, they're already going to have to scale their server to accommodate my users. Why do both of us have to do it? Answer: it's duplicate effort. No need." created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:31:10 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/08/13/staticJavascriptApps&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about this before. I believe in static JavaScript apps. It's the way to go. Services like Twitter, WordPress and Evernote would do well to make it easy for browser-based apps to call directly to their servers. Imho, of course. ;-)" created="Tue, 08 Jul 2014 11:32:56 GMT"/>

				<outline text="When Twitter was starting up, the API was a thing of simplistic beauty. You could get from start to Hello World in minutes. The years went by and Twitter changed a lot of things, and now the API is a minefield of difficulties. However, as a sufficiently motivated developer, I went through them. And got to where I needed to get." created="Mon, 07 Jul 2014 13:46:30 GMT"/>
				<outline text="A few days ago, I looked at my list of things to do that might involve a little investment, having dealt with most of the necessary fixes for the four products I'm maintaining (Fargo, Little Pork Chop, Happy Friends and Little Card Editor). It was a holiday weekend, a time that's good for digging in to complex problems. I decided I should at least &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; at the Facebook API to scope out how much work it would be." created="Mon, 07 Jul 2014 13:47:48 GMT"/>
				<outline text="To my surprise, and pleasure -- the scouting mission turned quickly into a production mission. I was able, in a few minutes to get a JavaScript app to connect to Facebook, and post a simple Hello World &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/252948118245934&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt;. So I decided to go further, and see what it would take to post a picture to Facebook. There, the docs were a bit more scarce, and the posts on Stack Exchange more confusing. But eventually I found a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/andyburke/1498758&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, and after a few hours of fiddling around with it, I got it to post a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=253021144905298&amp;set=a.253021138238632.1073741834.100005922431565&amp;type=3&amp;theater&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook. (The big problem it turns out was base64 decoding, the internal JavaScript decoder wasn't doing the right thing, but it all worked when I included a bit of developer-written &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danguer/blog-examples/blob/master/js/base64-binary.js&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;.)" created="Mon, 07 Jul 2014 13:48:54 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Then came the gnarly problem of figuring out how to arrange the user interface of &quot;Little Card Editor&quot; so instead of just logging into one web service, you could use two. I needed to do this without confusing users to the point of despair. Whether I accomplished that or not will be determined by the users, who now have their hands on the product, &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlecard.smallpict.com/2014/07/07/littleCardEditor054.html&quot;&gt;Little Card Editor 0.54&lt;/a&gt;." created="Mon, 07 Jul 2014 13:51:18 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I'm really good at letting big companies know when they screw up (see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/07/04/aboutFacebookUsersAndFacebook.html&quot;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; post) so it's only fair to be equally vocal when they do an outstanding job. Someone at Facebook wants developers to be successful with their platform. I thoroughly enjoyed this work. To be fair I also enjoyed working with Twitter's API (I'm a glutton for tough technical problems). But there's nothing like breaking through on a super valuable connection in almost no time.

			<outline text="About Facebook users and Facebook" created="Fri, 04 Jul 2014 11:13:27 GMT" isFeedItem="true" name="aboutFacebookUsersAndFacebook" type="outline">
				<outline text="Briefly, why the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/29/facebook-explains-emotion-experiment/&quot;&gt;Facebook eruption&lt;/a&gt; is unlike all previous ones."/>
				<outline text="0. We need a name for this event."/>
				<outline text="1. Conducting tests on humans without their consent is unethical for doctors and academics. Nothing vague about this. And there are good reasons for it. Testing can do harm."/>
				<outline text="2. You say that A-B testing is done all the time on websites. Well, perhaps people should have to consent to that too. But this was different. They were testing the Facebook newsfeed. That's not like Amazon testing a product page to find out which one gets more business. People know they're being sold products there. They willfully chose to go to Amazon to be sold. Choice is very clear."/>
				<outline text="3. The newsfeed is in dangerous territory. People *thought* they had an idea what it was. But this news raises questions, things people clearly don't want to have to think about."/>
				<outline text="4. Am I reading ads? Yes, I know that. That's clear."/>
				<outline text="5. Am I reading ideas and news from friends? Yes, I can see that too."/>
				<outline text="6. Am I being tested like a lab rat in a science experiment? Well, that's not obvious at all, until now. And I don't like the idea. I feel important. I am the center of my own universe. I think somehow Facebook doesn't understand that I am a person, just like they are. In fact, now I'm *sure* of it."/>
				<outline text="7. That last one is probably the biggest issue for Facebook. If they want their service to work, long-term, they have to have suspension of disbelief, like a good book or movie. You're inducing a trance. We're being captured by the story. If the real story is scientists in lab coats, with notebooks, measuring us like lab rats, well that might be good for a while, a social network for lab rats, but I'm going to probably not spend ALL my time there, and probably only if I'm sort of kinky and into S&amp;M a little."/>
				<outline text="8. Ideally, you want the user not to think about Facebook at all. To get lost in the story of their own timeline. To feel as if this was something created just for him or her, with knowledge of what makes them special, and with care and love. It's impossible (I think) for an algorithm to love you, but it should feel that way."/>
				<outline text="9. So that's the problem. Facebook just broke the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall&quot;&gt;fourth wall&lt;/a&gt;. Of a sudden we see the man behind the curtain. And it's ugly and arrogant and condescending and all around not a nice feeling."/>
				<outline text="10. To make matters worse the COO says they didn't want to upset us. Implying that the mistake was that we found out they're doing it. Well, at least we know she's not being coached by PR people. "/>
				<outline text="11. I'm not a PR consultant myself, and I don't really like PR. What I'd like instead is for Facebook to sober up a bit and come to grips with what it has accomplished and the responsibility that comes with it. More than anything FB has a bad case of hubris. Sure, you're talented, and special in many ways. But no human being can be so deep and smart and strong as to understand a social network with this many people using it. It was a huge accomplishment to create it, and huge every day it keeps running, but beyond that, the network is being created by the users. And when you get involved with the network in such a plainly disrespectful way, you break the implicit contract with the users, that you will just facilitate, and let them create their own experience here."/>
				<outline text="12. Facebook needs something like the code of ethics that news organizations have, if you want to keep the trust of users. That's the main conclusion. And clean house, people who don't understand the role of facilitator, and feel like gods, should go. That's the downfall of all tech companies, its seems. This feeling that you're a new kind of human. You are not. Every generation thinks it is, only to find out it's not true."/>

				<outline text="Amazon S3 is a storage system. You put files up there and can access them either publicly over the web or privately through an API, or both. It's cheap, highly available static storage, and has been around a long time and works well, it's in a lot of developers' toolkits. I use it in all my stuff. This page you're reading right now is coming from S3." created="Sat, 30 Aug 2014 15:06:38 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If the two were combined, if you could access Zocalo storage from S3, either reading or writing, you'd have a space that is shared by users, real end-users who are not developers, people who generally can't or won't get over the hurdles to become an S3 user. They would have all the benefits of using S3 without of the complexities." created="Sat, 30 Aug 2014 15:08:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="We already have some of that with Dropbox. But there's a key feature S3 has that Dropbox does not, the ability to put domain names on S3 locations. So we can make it simple to access as well, and the users can control the content. If they want to get off S3 someday they can do it, just by redirecting the domain. And short domain names are much simpler than the long Dropbox URLs which look very fragile.

				<outline text="I'm both white and a bike rider, and I know what he's talking about. I ride in NYC, so I'm an urban rider. We have lots of bike lanes, but they aren't respected by drivers and pedestrians. Delivery trucks park in the bike lane on narrow streets, forcing me to merge with car traffic. They even do it on fairly steep hills, where I'm moving much more slowly than the cars. This is something subtle that I'm sure is missed by most drivers. They take up the same amount of space, and they're moving fast, and they obviously feel pain when I move into &quot;their&quot; space, but did they notice that the space reserved for me is occupied by a UPS truck? Sometimes by a cop van. I've even been lectured by a cop who was blocking the bike lane on safe riding procedures. &quot;Yes sir,&quot; I said. This is NYC where cops are obeyed, not talked back to (except on my blog)." created="Sat, 30 Aug 2014 14:02:30 GMT" img="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/08/30/bike.gif" url="http://davewiner.com/?story=bike"/>
				<outline text="I've been hit by cars twice. Once when I was a kid, and once a couple of years ago. In each case I was riding too bravely, blamed myself, but also in each case the driver was asserting rights that weren't his. When I'm riding I'm at a disadvantage. I make up for it, or try to, by being especially alert. I've also found that sometimes it's dangerous not to be assertive, it can leave you in a place where you're much more vulnerable than if you take what's yours by law. But more often the right answer is to accept indignity and move on, and save the fight for a battle I have a chance of winning." created="Sat, 30 Aug 2014 14:04:52 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Now, why?" created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 17:53:43 GMT"/>
				<outline text="1. When I have a blog post to write, I have a dilemma. Do I post to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, or to Facebook? The blog has advantages. It's a complete archive of my writing. It's relatively easy to find an old post. It's indexed by search engines. It can be quoted on Wikipedia, and easily linked to from Twitter. On the other hand, Facebook delivers more readers and engagement. And despite all the advantages of blogging, Facebook is winning. " created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:05:57 GMT"/>
				<outline text="3. It's not just blogs that feel this heat, so do journalism sites. Ones that connect well to Facebook get rich, ones that don't, don't. It's a generalization, but trends are made out of generalizations. " created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:09:02 GMT"/>
				<outline text="4. The more it happens, the more it's going to happen." created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:10:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="5. Trying to reverse the trend is not something anyone can think their way to. Maybe there's a way to get lucky, to create some instantly popular form of content that doesn't work with Facebook well. Like Whatsapp, or Instagram, or Oculus. And even so, Facebook adapts. They're really smart and gutsy and I admire the way they do it. Most companies by the time they get to Facebook's size are less agile. " created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:10:56 GMT"/>
				<outline text="6. I asked Google for an API like the one Facebook provided. They said no. Twitter isn't a candidate, though they have a good API, the 140-character limit means I never have to choose between posting on my blog or Twitter. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/we-could-make-history-349109119cee&quot;&gt;asked Medium&lt;/a&gt; to work with me on this. Didn't get an answer." created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:27:52 GMT"/>
				<outline text="7. I don't think Facebook is hurt by a vibrant competitive market in publishing tools that post to Facebook &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; post elsewhere, simultaneously. This is where development happens fastest, without the huge installed base to bring along. If this is cut off, that cuts off growth. I think we've already been dealing with this, for a long time. I believe if Facebook opens up more, the lights will start coming back on in new content management tools." created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:13:09 GMT"/>
				<outline text="8. &lt;i&gt;So the web and Facebook can co-exist and feed off each others' growth.&lt;/i&gt; Seems like a win-win. Facebook readers get higher fidelity content, more beautiful, easier to read. It's more effective for authors. And blogs and news organizations can easily publish and maintain their content in two or more places. When you're liveblogging an event, for example, you can't manually copy and paste every time something new happens." created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:30:51 GMT"/>
				<outline text="9. Like others, I tried for a few years to live in a world without Facebook. I deleted my account, around the time Diaspora started. I forget why I was fed up, but I was. Did I think that my withdrawing from Facebook would hurt them? No, I didn't. Did I think I could continue as if Facebook didn't exist? I tried not to think about that.   " created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:14:35 GMT"/>

				<outline text="2. I've been working non-stop for the last 20 years on blogging software. Even though my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/whatsComingInFargo2.html&quot;&gt;newest product&lt;/a&gt; is wonderful in many ways, very few people look at it, and even fewer use it.

It was either add something to the mix, to change the market, or give up. " created="Sun, 24 Aug 2014 13:07:36 GMT"/>
				<outline text="12. I want to continue making great blogging tools. And I want lots of people to use them. So these steps are on my path. I can't succeed without doing this. If you can create a market even a fraction as big as Facebook's that delivers the readers and engagement, then I'll do the same with your platform, if you want to work together.

I had been thinking about him just a few days ago, and thought it was remarkable that he brought such obvious joy to everything he did. Now I see that was just on the surface, that underneath it, he dealt with demons. Maybe they were the same demons we all face, maybe they were different. I immediately want to know his story. What were his parents like? Did they love him? I wonder. Williams might have been the most love-seeking person on the planet, the most demonstrative at proving he was worthy of love. How does a person develop that way? What was opposite his personality that it formed in such a way?"/>

Try as hard as you can, you don't know what the experience was. What his experience was in the last minutes of life. Was he aware of it? Did he decide to end it? How sad it must have been.

He's only a memory, and you can't get a hug from a memory, there's no inspiration in his life story, because he gave up.

				<outline text="We've seen a lot of changes in media since the advent of the personal computer.

				<outline text="A great example of this, so dramatic someone should make a movie about it, was the change predicted by Napster in 2000. It happened so suddenly, unlike most technological shifts, that if you were alive then, you almost certainly remember the euphoria. People were talking about music in supermarkets and on airplanes. Why? Because a power that had once been reserved to radio stations, the power to program music, was now available to everyone." created="Sat, 09 Aug 2014 13:22:33 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I became an advocate for, and poster child for users of Napster. My first experience, which was mocked by music publishers and professional musicians, was on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/06/18.html&quot;&gt;Father's Day&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, when I heard a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-7c4VNGOgU&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; on the radio that reached me emotionally, in a huge way. I wanted to hear it again, immediately, before the mood passed. I looked on Napster. There it was. And I got to listen to it within seconds. That in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/07/07.html#musicAndTheInternet&quot;&gt;nutshell&lt;/a&gt; was the innovation, if you care to call it that. I think of it as a dam breaking. A technical limit imposed by copyright owners, that wasn't necessary from a technological standpoint. Database technology and Internet connectivity had advanced enough, years before 2000, to make the old record store-based distribution system obsolete. All it took was a nervy young &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning&quot;&gt;dude&lt;/a&gt;, who felt he had nothing to lose, to break down the barrier." created="Sat, 09 Aug 2014 13:24:33 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The copyright owners were able to shut down Napster, legally, but the idea of users programming their own music had escaped and today people think nothing of it, using Spotify, Pandora or whatever -- to get the music they want when they want it. Has the music industry been able to adapt? No, or somewhat, it's not clear yet. But there are no guarantees, when your business is based on a temporary technological limit. When the limit is erased, so is your business model." created="Sat, 09 Aug 2014 13:27:53 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Napster and the music industry is just one example. It's happening everywhere, in every medium. The latest eruption is in books, with Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readersunited.com/&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that e-books should be cheaper, and book publishers saying something else (not clear to me what they're saying)." created="Sat, 09 Aug 2014 13:29:32 GMT"/>
				<outline text="To figure out if it's a lost cause, if eventually a new equilibrium will create a path around your paywall, ask yourself if it's inevitable that the limit you depend on will always be there. If not, then you'd probably be better off accepting the change as soon as possible. And don't try to create an acceptable level of change, as the news industry is still doing. Only the full change predicted by the technology has a chance of finding a new balance. " created="Sat, 09 Aug 2014 13:30:28 GMT"/>
				<outline text="It can be hard to do this. Especially when an industry has convinced itself that it is, itself, the disruptive change. This happened to Microsoft in the 90s, when the Internet forever changed the way software is developed. Their reaction was to try to capture all the newness of the Internet in their software stacks, Windows and Office. It worked for a while, until they felt they had the insurrection quelled and took their eye off the ball, and their products were overwhelmed by malware. Since they weren't using the Internet the way their users were, they didn't see it, or if they did, didn't recognize it as their problem. Apple was no more tuned in than Microsoft, they were just lucky that their OS was not dominant, therefore not targeted by the malware makers. That's how the shift away from Windows started. " created="Sat, 09 Aug 2014 13:32:14 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Books have gotten easier to buy and read using electronic technology. All you have to do to see that is to buy a book on a Kindle and compare the experience to buying a book in a bookstore, the act that the Kindle replaces. It uses a tiny bit of Internet bandwidth to transfer a book from a server to a reader. The user experience, esp for 700-page books (an experience I tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/08/01/#a1406910893&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; with a paperback and found impossible), is vastly superior. You can carry your library with you everywhere. The cost, of course, will go down. Perhaps that means less money for publishers and authors. So you have to figure out what the world will look like after this change is complete, and prepare for that world. Longing for the world as it was before the change is pointless. Lots of people have done that, argued for it, but it never seems to work out for them. " created="Sat, 09 Aug 2014 13:34:44 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I'm trying to get my writing to take place in my space, with my tools. That way I can tweak them and make them work better. And have the writing distributed and automatically updated in all the different places people want to read it. Today, for me, that means posting to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/283814631825949&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, posting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/516284939890065408&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to Twitter, and putting it out on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; feed.

				<outline text="But when a new system shows up without an API, as several have, that means I can't push my writing to them, unless I use their editor to write it, or resort to copy/paste.

				<outline text="The web of 2014 is in the middle of a huge battle to force people to write the stuff in the same place people read it. Whether you hate advertising or not doesn't matter, it's all part of the same system. You make me, as a writer, choose either to give it all to you, or none to you. And yet the underlying network that doesn't have these limits. "/>
				<outline text="What do other people want? Maybe they can write about it. I know what I want. I want to be a powerful communicator. Maybe I'd be willing to sacrifice some of the power if one of these guys was offering to pay me. But so far the money goes to their founders and a few others, and tiny amounts of money go to professional writers and academics. So our work is a labor of love. But here's the problem -- I don't feel love for any of these environments. Quite the opposite. I know what's possible, and I resent the fact that they're deliberately thwarting it. I do love the web, and all that it enables. But if I use the web to communicate, I forgo access to all the people who have locked themselves into the silos. "/>
				<outline text="My option, which is also probably yours, is to accept the worst deal possible: really weak writing tools with confusing interfaces, no standards, and very narrow access to your thinking by others, restricted by who's looking at their silo when it happens to come out. This is a *terrible* deal. "/>
				<outline text="I really want to, now more than ever, build an open network of writing and ideas. I'd be happy to use great writing tools, and be able to distribute my ideas exclusively to other people who value freedom. To me, that's a fair trade-off. "/>

				<outline text="I remember when I first encountered a software tester. I had just signed up with a publisher, and they employed testers, and one was assigned to my product. His first report was a total shocker. He found so many problems with my product. I thought some of them were really petty, some indicated he didn't understand the product, and in a very few cases he found real bugs. " created="Sun, 21 Sep 2014 13:47:33 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Over time, though, my point of view shifted. Petty problems or not, I wanted to know how my product worked for real people who weren't working on the code. Here was someone whose job it was to tell me. Things he didn't understand about the product were the most important for me, as the developer, to know about. Why? Because it's not about algorithms, or coding, these are the mistakes we made in the 70s, it's actually about creating functionality that real people can use, with minimum effort. It's all good data. And having a great tester on a team pretty much guarantees you won't ship garbage. (It &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate#dBASE_IV:_Decline_and_fall_.281988.E2.80.931990.29&quot;&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; happen.)" created="Sun, 21 Sep 2014 13:48:50 GMT"/>
				<outline text="A tester approaches a product as a user would, and does the things that occur to users. All the time taking notes. After that, the tester goes through the docs, and tests them too.

I wanted to hear the unvarnished truth about our products, and I wanted to be sure the developers were hearing it too." created="Sun, 21 Sep 2014 13:53:00 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I think all developers go through the initial hatred of the tester, feeling unloved, and depressed because the labor of our love is so awfully buggy, broken and badly designed! Oh.

He complimented me for doing a good job. I said it's not unusual, it's the kind of thing any software tester could do. And then I realized that my blogging about products is very much like a tester's reports. And perhaps that's why the developers of the products I write about get so angry with me. &quot;He should know that's not the way the product works! Oh that's just petty.&quot; See. But if you really embrace the experience of other people, people not schooled in the details of your implementation, you can learn how to make your work easier to absorb, and therefore more effective at what it's designed to do.

I was in the middle of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fangasm&quot;&gt;fangasm&lt;/a&gt;, enjoying my first day with a great new Apple product, the iPhone 6.

As I said in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/09/19/newIphoneQuestions.html&quot;&gt;write-up&lt;/a&gt;, the experience made everything feel new and smart.

				<outline text="#### An analogy" created="Sat, 20 Sep 2014 13:35:16 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I recently watched an old episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order&quot;&gt;Law &amp; Order&lt;/a&gt; where the accused murderer tried to excuse the act, by saying he did it so he could continue to send money to Israel. He was Jewish, as was his lawyer, and the judge. And the lawyer packed the jury with Jews, people he felt would be sympathetic to the argument. And the defense lawyer was very good. He had &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McCoy&quot;&gt;McCoy&lt;/a&gt; convinced he was about to lose the trial, even though the defendant was obviously guilty (he had more or less confessed). " created="Sat, 20 Sep 2014 13:52:35 GMT"/>
				<outline text="McCoy gave an incredibly good closing argument. He told the jurors that it was okay if they felt love for Israel, if they admired the defendant for supporting Israel, but this was America, and they were charged with deciding an American case, under American law. That the defendant, his wife, his attorney, and the judge were all obsessed with Israel was irrelevant to the case. They had to decide guilty or not guilty based on what happened in New York, not Tel Aviv. The jury came back with a guilty verdict. That's the right, satisfying outcome, no matter how you feel about the Jewish cause (and the case was much more compelling than I make it sound here). " created="Sat, 20 Sep 2014 13:41:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Another example. In the 90s, just as the web was taking off, Congress passed and the President signed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act&quot;&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; that severely limited the First Amendment on the Internet, in the name of protecting children from pornography. Luckily the courts intervened, and declared the law unconstitutional. Don't they love children? Doesn't matter. The First Amendment clearly applies to the Internet, they said. And Congress can't do what they just did. Thank goodness they weren't fanboys for Internet Decency, as the President and Congress were." created="Sat, 20 Sep 2014 13:44:10 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I think by now, I've made my case." created="Sat, 20 Sep 2014 13:46:01 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If journalism is to mean anything, we need sober and dispassionate observers, who stay seated when everyone else is cheering. Why? Because that's what they're paid to do. We need to have the facts, not just the emotions. And we need every competitor to feel that in every product launch they have a chance to win, and for some (like Apple) they must feel that they can lose. When journalists are so obviously in the bag, standing up and giving a rousing ovation to what is a nice, but hardly revolutionary product, that's just plain wrong. " created="Sat, 20 Sep 2014 13:46:07 GMT"/>
				<outline text="It's also important because of the huge power a company like Apple has over our freedom. They decide whether or not applications can ship. And often those apps are tied to our ability to communicate and share information. If Apple decides to curtail our speech, don't you want reporters to be free to tell us that's what's happening? In the current system, I would place almost no trust in the reporters, given the way they report on Apple. It's a corrupt system, and the reporters are complicit." created="Sat, 20 Sep 2014 13:58:26 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The other night I was drinking beers, watching the Niners &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/49ers-collapse-in-4th-quarter-lose-Levi-s-5755609.php&quot;&gt;lose&lt;/a&gt; to the Bears, in a Mets-like way, when all of a sudden I was deluged under a wave of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble&quot;&gt;Scoble&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook. I had expressed a few ideas during the day that Scoble apparently was offended by, even though imho he misunderstood the point of each of them. Take one example. I pointed to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/09/without-a-keyboard.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+typepad/sethsmainblog+(Seth%27s+Blog)&quot;&gt;Seth Godin piece&lt;/a&gt; that I loved that said if you give up your keyboard you give up your power. He wasn't saying that virtual keyboards are no good. Though that's how Scoble (and honestly quite a few others) responded. He was saying (to me) let's not turn the Internet into another television. Not that TV doesn't have its place. I like a football game on a Sunday evening. Especially at a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi's_Stadium&quot;&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; in my former &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/10/08/teaParty&quot;&gt;hometown&lt;/a&gt;.

I love to go back and read things I wrote about previous product intros from Apple and others, especially when I was wrong, to learn about my intuition and judgement. I get better at this each time, and make better product decisions of my own.

				<outline text="#### Apple Watch is zzzz" created="Wed, 10 Sep 2014 12:43:30 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The Apple Watch was basically paying a debt, and it's not a product Steve Jobs would have shipped. The debt is that the new Apple management has to show investors that they can ship something new. It probably indicates that they don't have anything better in the pipe, and that's fine. It could be at this point in history there aren't any new devices that make sense. I find myself with a glut of devices, my desk drawer is full of them. That expresses my wish that there's something new I can buy that'll be as interesting as the first smart phones (and Apple's wasn't my first, or even the most exciting, though it is what I use now)." created="Wed, 10 Sep 2014 12:28:55 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If Apple wanted to ship a product that is as incredibly potent as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; was, they should disrupt something that doesn't want to be disrupted, but desperately needs it. If Apple had a device that could create journalism that was exciting, individualistic, intelligent, thought-provoking, to compete with the dead-eyes stuff that passes for journalism, then they'd have an iPod-like product that said to the music industry, which was in a similar place in 2001, to get the fuck out of the way. Apple said each song costs $0.99. No more albums. We are your distribution, and by the way fuck off. A few years later all the record stores were gone and the power in music had shifted from Hollywood to Cupertino. " created="Wed, 10 Sep 2014 12:31:01 GMT"/>

What else could they possibly do with the piles of cash they were accumulating? They're going to lend it to us, and we're going to pay them interest. Over time, the fact that they make hardware or support customers, or have retail stores, will be interesting anachronistic sidelines. Apple, Amazon and Google investors will judge their companies on how well they work as financial institutions. It's something investors understand, and the money you make in finance comes without the headaches of having to actually make anything. " created="Wed, 10 Sep 2014 12:34:16 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Apple has hundreds of millions of credit card numbers, and they'll be useful until they completely replace the banks. Apple is bigger than any of them, and has bank-sized financial resources. And the way we pay for stuff today with little plastic cards, some with chips on them, is backwards. The chips in our phones are much more capable. And putting them on our wrist in a big form factor isn't interesting. They will be embedded in our keychain next, and then in our actual bodies.

RSS had existed for three years at that point, and they weren't hugely productive. It was still mostly potential and quite vulnerable.

				<outline text="Back when we started podcasting, Doc Searls or Rex Hammock, or maybe both of them, looked up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=podcast&amp;oq=podcast&quot;&gt;word&lt;/a&gt; on Google, and made note of the number of hits, thinking that someday there would be millions. Sometimes you get a feeling something is going to be big. Podcasting was of course one of those things. "/>
				<outline text="Here's a question like that for you to think about."/>
				<outline text="Two years from now, what percentage of the posts on Facebook will come through the API vs being entered directly in the Facebook app or through the website?"/>
				<outline text="It'll be a function of two things: 1. How much functionality shows through the Facebook API. 2. How much interest there is among developers."/>
				<outline text="Without #1 there won't be much #2. I know some pundits think developers won't trust Facebook (I've heard them say this privately). I think developers are fools for fresh new territory to explore, even if they are vulnerable when they do it. Trust doesn't really enter into it. We'll &quot;trust&quot; Facebook because the idea is so juicy. Developers are on a perpetual trail of tears. But *sometimes* we do get to have some fun. "/>
				<outline text="Anyway I think the number will be large. I think the Facebook people are very excited about what can happen with more power showing through the API. And the API is already quite good and easy to understand, and works wonderfully with browser-based JavaScript apps, as well as or better than Dropbox."/>
				<outline text="So I'm going to say: 40% after two years, with the line pointing upward toward 80% in five. And part of me thinks that's conservative. ;-)"/>

				<outline text="2. Another word I say when something works is &quot;Bing!&quot; -- a happy, self-impressed version of &quot;Thank you.&quot; This predates the Microsoft search engine.

				<outline text="3. This is one I've started saying recently: &quot;Whenever you're ready.&quot; I say it when something I just caused to happen is taking longer than I think it should.

I have not been paid for this, so I'm still an independent developer. I am creating software designed to fit into the new ecosystem that Facebook is contemplating. That ecosystem is a lot like the one I designed years ago around &quot;RSS&quot;. " created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:10:21 GMT" img="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/10/27/dog.gif"/>
				<outline text="Now, the fact that I'm able to work with them tells you something about what Facebook is doing, and how they're doing it. If they were planning on eating the news industry, I would ask for a lot of money to help them do it. I might take the money, because the news industry is so frustratingly unable to chart their own future. And we do need news. And maybe the news industry isn't the best way forward for news in the coming years. One has to consider all the possibilities, even an independent developer and blogger such as myself." created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:11:53 GMT"/>

				<outline text="First, Facebook isn't a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/books/review/whats-a-dog-for-by-john-homans.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;, so let's get that out of the way. ;-)" created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:06:15 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Facebook is a huge social network with 1.3 billion users. It runs amazingly fast for something so grand, and is almost never down. It's an unprecedented technical accomplishment, akin to a moon mission or a self-driving car. All those data centers responding to all our interactions, so quickly. That's never happened before on the scale that Facebook operates. " created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:16:06 GMT"/>
				<outline text="But in addition to sharing selfies and family events, it can also be a fantastic news delivery system. It can, but it isn't yet that. Sure there are news stories on Facebook, but the designers there envision something much greater. " created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:17:03 GMT"/>

				<outline text="#### How will it turn out?" created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:35:50 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Do they know how it will turn out? I'm sure they don't. They didn't get to be Facebook by answering all the questions up front before embarking on a technological journey. They put something out there, see if it sticks, learn from the users' experience, change the product, etc etc. How do I know this? Because it's the same process every other person who designs software uses. We don't know how things will turn out, any more than the manager of the Giants knows the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/sports/baseball/world-series-2014-madison-bumgarner-and-sf-giants-shut-down-kc-royals-and-close-in-on-title.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;outcome&lt;/a&gt; of a World Series game before it starts. You just put your best team on the field and see what happens." created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:18:13 GMT"/>
				<outline text="What Facebook wants is lots of news to give their users. And of course they want to put advertising next to the news, as always, and they are willing to share revenue with the news people and software developers." created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:20:25 GMT"/>
				<outline text="#### What does the NYT want?" created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:21:06 GMT"/>
				<outline text="While I think I understand what Facebook wants, I'm pretty sure I don't understand what Carr's employer, the New York Times, wants. They hire engineers, but they're more like producers. They aren't building a news system to compete with Twitter or Facebook. " created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:21:13 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Unlike Facebook, authoring for the Times is still an exclusive thing. I can put something up on Facebook, and there's at least a chance of a million people reading it.

				<outline text="#### Should the Times work with Facebook?" created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:23:13 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I don't know. The Times hasn't articulated a clear strategy. I don't know what they're doing, so it's hard to know whether it makes sense for them to work with Facebook. But, it's hard to imagine a scenario where they can afford to say anything other than an enthusiastic Yes! to the offer to collaborate. I certainly said yes when they asked me, without a moment's hesitation." created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:23:23 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The short answer is this. Like it or not, Facebook exists. " created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:24:47 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Sure I remember a time when they didn't. Had I done things differently perhaps I could be where Zuckerberg is now. But that isn't what I wanted. I envisioned a world where there were lots of totally independent Internet-based news orgs and bloggers, on a level playing field, all learning from each other, and gradually, iteratively inventing the future of news." created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:24:58 GMT"/>

				<outline text="A lot of the TV industry remains intact, in fact it's flourishing. Quite possibly the same way that Facebook and the news industry can co-exist. But we need a Hulu for news, and lots of smaller hubs, analogous to the movie industry's festivals. Open news rooms. Places for independent news efforts to flourish. Bloggers and YouTubers, we're really the same thing. And these days you see a lot of YouTube on networks, on the nightly news and entertainment shows. News has to go through a similar transition. It has to become less exclusive, less elite. This rigidness is doing more harm than Carr's imaginary dog could ever do." created="Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:40:15 GMT"/>

				<outline text="2. It was a story of when I was a CEO of a tech startup, a long time ago. We had an employee sue us for wrongful termination. " created="Wed, 22 Oct 2014 14:35:39 GMT"/>
				<outline text="3. It was probably a setup. The guy had sued previous employers, it turns out, though I didn't know it at the time. It never showed up in the reference checks we did, probably because lawyers advise against telling future prospective employers about these things, thus provoking a new lawsuit. And often settlements include mutual non-disclosure agreements." created="Wed, 22 Oct 2014 14:36:08 GMT"/>
				<outline text="4. We didn't terminate him because he was older, he was fired because he wasn't doing any work. We were a small company, and struggling, and this was before VCs gave startups lots of runway. Once we got our initial investment, that was it, we were on our own to either make it or not. We couldn't afford to have any developers on staff who weren't producing." created="Wed, 22 Oct 2014 14:36:47 GMT"/>

				<outline text="6. My CEO days are behind me, so I can afford to tell the story of how CEOs make these kinds of decisions.

" created="Wed, 22 Oct 2014 14:38:17 GMT"/>
				<outline text="7. Joey thought I was saying that employers should age-discriminate! Oy. Nothing could be further from the truth. He said this was bad because I myself was 58 at the time (I'm now 59). I said to him, yesterday, that should have been a clue that he had drawn a conclusion about my thinking that was incorrect.

				<outline text="8. This makes it good art, because it caused a strong reaction from which we both could learn about ourselves and each other.

				<outline text="1. Yes, Twitter screwed its developers, but..." created="Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:01:58 GMT"/>
				<outline text="2. Apple did too. I was a Mac developer in the 90s, and Apple did a series of reversals, for the same reasons Twitter did. Changes in management. Stock market pressures. Corporate confusion. The return of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/02/01/whoboughtwho.jpg&quot;&gt;founder&lt;/a&gt;. First System 6 was to be &quot;it,&quot; then Copland, then NextStep, and finally they bundled apps that, they said, made ours obsolete. They didn't, but that wouldn't have mattered. So we left. And like Marco, re Twitter, stayed away." created="Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:02:08 GMT"/>
				<outline text="3. But Marco is an Apple developer. I'm sure he doesn't overlook their past transgressions, but if you want to make software for a corporate platform, these are the risks. They all will eventually screw you. Is it worth it anyway? That's for each of us to decide." created="Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:04:02 GMT"/>
				<outline text="4. I make news software. Given what I do, I have to work with Twitter. The only other options are to change what I do, or to retire. I've tried that. But I keep coming back. I like what I do." created="Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:04:55 GMT"/>
				<outline text="5. My approach is to have more than one leg. I send news to Facebook, to RSS and to the web via HTML. If Twitter screws us again, I'll still have the other legs. And, because the other legs are there, I think Twitter is less likely to screw us. " created="Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:05:30 GMT"/>
				<outline text="6. Also, I'd bet on this: Twitter is not going to screw us in the short term. They need us as much as we need them. Independent developers are where wholly new ideas come from. You can't hire people to do that to work inside companies. They are subject to the mess that companies are, always. Twitter is no exception. Just look at history. It's always independent developers that break through. Twitter desperately needs this. Their internal development has to go in a certain direction. With developers creating new stuff, they have a chance at some new ideas developing around their platform. The more limits they put out there, the less chance there is. Do they understand this? I don't know. I hope so." created="Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:06:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="7. They are a public company, and I have a voice. I can talk to users, other developers, their competitors, the press. If Twitter reverses, again, visibly, it won't be a quiet thing, as it was last time. They're in a different place now. And when it happens, assuming it does, while I am still developing, the world will be in a different place too. It's impossible to foresee how it will go, but it almost certainly will not go the way it did last time." created="Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:08:18 GMT"/>
				<outline text="8. Corporate platforms always have this problem. The best thing is for us all to invest in our collective interest, and create alternate ways to flow news that are not centralized, where there's no company that can shut us down. I would argue that long-term this is even in Twitter's interest, but Marco -- you and I and every other independent developer, we have collective interests. We'll do better if we, in addition to supporting the corporate platforms that we have to, also invest in open platforms that work alongside them. " created="Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:09:55 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The real reason I was writing was:"/>
				<outline text="1. I was a Mac developer."/>
				<outline text="2. I had a heavy investment in writing Mac software."/>
				<outline text="3. The Mac was the best machine for creating content for the web."/>
				<outline text="4. The Mac was losing, in the press, and with developers."/>
				<outline text="5. But there was still a lot of Mac software, and it was still better than anything you could get on Windows. Far better, because the OS had years on Microsoft, as did the developer base."/>
				<outline text="6. Now get this, even though the Mac was still ahead, the press was reporting the conventional wisdom: Mac is dead. Reason: No new software."/>
				<outline text="7. But that was crap. The reporters knew it was crap. Because they were all using Macs (there were exceptions, people who covered Microsoft, for example). And they didn't do this out of the goodness of their hearts. They did it because if they were to use Windows, they'd be leaving a lot of stuff they need behind."/>
				<outline text="8. But what they were saying *was* killing the Mac."/>
				<outline text="9. I wanted to keep playing, and I did not want to port my software to Windows (I eventually did, only when it was clear that Apple was abandoning our platform, in favor of NextStep. After all we had been through with them, if it meant porting, I'd port to Windows, and get off Apple's trail for developers.)"/>
				<outline text="10. Key point -- the blogosphere was created out of a story that the press was telling that was damaging, costly, and untrue. Had the press responded creatively to the Internet, and said &quot;Geez this reshuffles the deck, we thought Apple was dead, but look, they've actually got a big lead&quot; -- I could have stuck to writing software."/>
				<outline text="11. Never mind, because Apple never accepted the advantage they had in the web. They had good reasons -- everything they stood for was violated by the web. The Mac was a graphic computer. The web had GIFs and JPEGs, but aside from that it was entirely text based. It was a Unix developer's dream. And a graphic developer's nightmare."/>
				<outline text="12. I'll go where ever the action is. If I have to learn how to develop graphic apps, so be it. If I have to learn HTML, okay I'll do that too. But Apple wasn't like that. They saw the web, didn't like it, and said no thanks."/>
				<outline text="13. Needless to say all this made great fodder for a blog. And that's why DaveNet and then Scripting News, were so successful and inspired so many others to do it. I thought I was making web content management systems. But to make that work, we needed to have content that needed management, in other words, blogs. "/>

				<outline text="2. Most people who follow you aren't around to see what you post, when you post it. People post items more than once to make up for this.

				<outline text="4. Why not have two modes. One for experts, and one for newbies. The newcomers get a highly algorithmic, maybe even editorially curated feed, so that Twitter seems more interesting to them. The old-timers can continue to use the system as-is.

				<outline text="5. Think of the expert-level system as the newsroom, where people work on stories, and entertain, anger and mystify each other with wisecracks, snorts and grunts, all of which are over the heads of new users, and likely over the heads of most experts too. Speaking from experience there. ;-)" created="Sat, 18 Oct 2014 00:36:20 GMT"/>
				<outline text="6. The kind of functionality people ask for would work if Twitter were an open system, subject to competition. Then we could have all kinds of choices of how to sample the news, a market would develop for different methods, and we'd see better news reading systems develop. But Twitter is a closed ecosystem, only one company can try out new ideas. Okay, so why complain when they try something new? How many years do we have to wait to develop new interfaces? " created="Sat, 18 Oct 2014 00:37:12 GMT"/>
				<outline text="7. The people who want Twitter to be pure really want a platform without a platform vendor. The web already is that.

We even hated it when previous generations used lock-in to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/10/10/#a1413003074&quot;&gt;keep us&lt;/a&gt; in our place. Of course it backfired.

				<outline text="Leave quietly, that's the classy thing to do. That way you're sure what you're doing is leaving, and not punishing, or asking for an apology, asking the person to change, or asking to be talked out of leaving. If you're doing any of those things, have the guts to say it directly. By not tagging the person you blame, you're making sure you're leaving for the reasons you say you are.

				<outline text="Another related motto from my longtime friend David Jacobs: No old tomatoes. Which means, no ultimatums. For the same reason as not slamming the door on the way out.

				<outline text="1. The tech industry needs to change, to adjust to the reality that it's no longer a startup industry. Our products are used everywhere. They are infrastructure, culture, part of our work and family lives, our intellectual, financial and emotional lives. " created="Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:49:59 GMT"/>

				<outline text="2. The press obliged. They love the money. Not because they get the money, they don't. But it's easier to follow the money than it is to understand the technology. So they report the mystique of the genius that creates our gee-whiz tech. That might have made sense in the 70s and 80s, but not now. Tech is the fabric of our civilization. It's not a mystery." created="Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:51:18 GMT"/>
				<outline text="3. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;Sources&lt;/a&gt; now have the power of the press. There is nothing surprising or wrong with the idea of a tech company investigating reporters. The idea that only reporters have the ability to publish is a 20th century idea. Now anyone who wants to speak can start a blog or a podcast and get up and speak." created="Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:54:20 GMT"/>
				<outline text="4. What do the reporters fear will be discovered about them? The biggest most obvious truth is that most of them are lazy and report the same story everyone else does. They wait for the press release. How can you tell? Just watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=river&quot;&gt;the river&lt;/a&gt;. It's amazing how a story &quot;breaks&quot; across all the different tech pubs at the same time. There are only a handful of publications that do real reporting. Most of what we get are repurposed press releases." created="Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:55:19 GMT"/>
				<outline text="5. So where the tech industry has to grow up, the tech press has to earn its keep. There are plenty of stories that never get covered. Why is Chrome such a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/20/chromeIsDyingDay3.html&quot;&gt;buggy&lt;/a&gt; slow browser? Maybe the web would do better if someone in tech loved it. Why will Google go to such lengths to smear a blogger (me) who reports on it? The press cares when &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; get slimed (or potentially get slimed, it was just an idea that the Uber exec uttered, not a plan, or any kind of disclosure). The users know that Google is letting us down with Chrome. Don't the tech reporters use this product? Don't they notice that the quality is slipping? Why not write about it? That's a really good question. If the answer is they fear upsetting people at Google, then it's a much bigger deal than an Uber exec expressing frustration with some very awful reporting they've had to endure. " created="Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:56:52 GMT"/>
				<outline text="6. Yes, Uber is right. Sorry. They have every right to be upset about the &quot;coverage&quot; that Pando is doing. What an embarrassment for the industry. That the tech press is willing to go to war over Pando, just shows how ridiculous the whole thing has gotten. How would you feel if an editorial series blasted you for being an &quot;asshole,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://pando.com/2014/10/22/the-horrific-trickle-down-of-asshole-culture-at-a-company-like-uber/&quot;&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt; -- that's the word they used to describe Uber management. Not just in passing, as the key idea in a campaign. If we want the industry to grow up, the press has to grow up too. Name-calling is not something anyone should defend." created="Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:59:46 GMT"/>

Here's the thought that went through my head. &quot;This is something I might be able to get a job doing.&quot; So I signed up. That was it. I learned how to do it, but it wasn't much fun because the way we worked with the computer involved a lot of time &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/11/02/IeFyY.gif&quot;&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt;. If you left out a double-quote, it could take hours to find out. Fix it and wait for a few more hours. And you only had a budget of a certain amount of computer time. Once, doing a project for a professor I ran out. So I did the work by hand. It took a half hour to do what I had failed to do in &lt;i&gt;days&lt;/i&gt; of programming and waiting. That's where we were in the mid-70s." created="Sun, 02 Nov 2014 16:36:38 GMT"/>

It was economically impossible for some organizations to buy their own computers, they cost millions. So we let them run their apps on our computers. My job was to write custom programs for big customers. When their programs ran, the company might get $10,000 per day for the service. My time was a freebie. I wasn't encouraged to make my programs efficient, but I did anyway, to the best of my ability. All this on hardware that had far less capacity than the iPhone you carry around today in your pocket.

				<outline text="6. Not that it matters, but what exactly did the mayor do or say to so upset them? Perhaps he empathized with citizens who feared that NYPD wasn't up to the job, or worse, they simply murder citizens and expect impunity. The latter is what it looks like to me. The video of Eric Garner's death recorded a murder. His death was ruled a homicide by the coroner. This was &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt; than the murder of the two police officers, because it was done in the name of justice, and because there is no penalty for the murderers, so no disincentive to do it again. Garner was unarmed, and no threat to anyone. " created="Sun, 28 Dec 2014 16:19:53 GMT"/>
				<outline text="7. There will be more marches in the city. There was a hiatus, possibly out of respect for the grieving police (the mayor did ask that there be no demonstrations) or perhaps it was the Christmas holiday. But especially since the police made such a clear political statement at the funeral of Ramos, and because they outrageously blame the demonstrators for the deaths of the officers there are certain to be marches to emphasize that police killing citizens without recourse is still unacceptable. " created="Sun, 28 Dec 2014 16:21:27 GMT"/>

Will any of the police be cops who turned their back on the mayor? &lt;i&gt;We're supposed to trust them? &lt;/i&gt;What if they decide to have a political demo of their own while the citizens are marching? What then? We live in a police state as long as the police feel they can try to control political expression. Perhaps we always have lived in a police state in NYC, but now it's become evident because we have better communication tools. Whatever it is, if the police thought through the consequences of their disrespect for the mayor, then they are playing a very ugly and dangerous game with our freedom and our lives.

				<outline text="#### People who blog on Facebook" created="Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:07:51 GMT"/>
				<outline text="For me this has been the Year of Facebook. Until now, like a lot of other people I respect, I've been a holdout. I've written a lot about that here on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, why I held out, why I gave up, and why I am so enthusiastic about the blogging that happens on Facebook." created="Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:07:57 GMT"/>
				<outline text="There's a lot to like about it. Unlike Twitter, which because of its 140-character limit, reduces communication to what I call &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/09/17/#a1410998221&quot;&gt;Grunts and Snorts&lt;/a&gt;, and people to caricatures. Twitter is for slogans, tribal communication, mis-directed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/12/neil-degrasse-tysons-christmas-morning-jokes-ignite-pious-furor-on-twitter/&quot;&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has a cultural problem, and because the people who run it aren't actual users, they aren't likely to find their way through it. It's going to get worse." created="Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:09:15 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Facebook is different. There's room to express an idea. And a culture that's highly supportive. On both Twitter and Facebook I've gone from being master of my domain to a face in the crowd. But sometimes it's cool to be part of a group. I loved Twitter in the early years, but now most of that lives on Facebook. At least in 2014." created="Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:10:49 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The best thing about Facebook are the new friends I've made over the last year. People who I knew well enough to want to friend them (which is a relatively low bar), who turned out to be gems hiding in plain sight. For example, I've become friends with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/scottknaster?fref=ufi&quot;&gt;Scott Knaster&lt;/a&gt;, after knowing him since 1984, when were were both part of the early Mac community (he worked at Apple, doing docs for developers, I was a developer). We bonded around this year's baseball playoffs. And btw, today's his birthday, something I only know because of Facebook." created="Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:12:03 GMT"/>
				<outline text="There have been a dozen such new friendships that came from Facebook. Why? Because some people have the impulse to put themselves into their online expressions, and their humanity comes through in the form of vulnerability expressed with feeling. Because Facebook is so supportive, vulnerability comes more easily. I have a friend who went through serious surgery this year, and came out okay. Without Facebook, I might have heard about it through a friend, but I wouldn't have felt the story. I have another friend who lives for beauty, and it comes through in every expression. " created="Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:14:01 GMT"/>
				<outline text="So, in 2014, Facebook has picked up the ball for blogging. It's definitely not what I imagined, and I'm not comfortable with where it might be going. But for now, in 2014, the bloggers this year, that made a difference to me, came to me through Facebook. " created="Fri, 26 Dec 2014 17:15:37 GMT"/>

To software with bad error messages that waste users time (like iTunes, for example). Most tech today is developed by people with good attitude and not much experience.

If you want something great, simple, different, inspiring, you must choose different qualities in the people you work with. And worry less about fitting in and more about reaching for the stars."/>

We allowed this to happen. Now if we want it to stop, we're going to have to be strong. It's going to involve a lot more than marching in the streets. We're going to have to remain seated when we're asked to stand and honor our imperialism which devalues the lives of ordinary people, like us.

				<outline text="I was just chatting with a friend, and was reminded of a value that's really important. Everyone should start every conversation with a clean slate with the other person. If you're holding a grudge of any kind, ideally, that's been aired, and heard, and dealt with. I know this is an ideal, but the closer you are to it, the more value there is in the friendship." img="http://scripting.com/2015/01/27/freakBrothers.png" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabulous_Furry_Freak_Brothers"/>
				<outline text="If you can get through years of hanging out with someone, and yet still at the beginning of every interaction you can say the slate is clean, then you really have something."/>
				<outline text="It also works for people you've never met. If you let other people's grudges interfere with your perception of someone else, then you're not going to have the best interaction possible. The more the grudges color things, the more you're interacting with the grudge, and less with the real person, who might not even have any knowledge of it! "/>
				<outline text="Often, people don't bring their problems with other people to the person, they spread them around behind their back. You shouldn't let that kind of gossip interfere with your potential relationship. Again, that's an ideal to strive for. We're all human." created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:42:41 GMT"/>
				<outline text="On the other hand it means you have to be ready to hear from someone about something they feel wronged by. And after that if they can say &quot;it's now been dealt with&quot; you can get back to being buddies."/>
				<outline text="The behind-your-back part of it can be really insidious. A couple of times people have asked me &quot;Why does everyone say you're a dick.&quot; If that happens to you, please -- you do not have to respond to it. Or respond by pushing your glasses down your nose and look at the other person and say &quot;Really?&quot; Try an eye-roll. You are not responsible for the grudges people spread about you. " created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:45:14 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Also, many things that become grudges are really not worth worrying about at all. Remember how small we are and how short life is, and ask yourself if you can just let this one go, and not get full acceptance from the person who hurt you. Maybe this is a person who's worth it. " created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:00:36 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I tried an experiment a few years ago. Someone who had hurt my feelings came up in conversation with someone else, in public. So I said the other person was a very generous, wise and sweet person. Guess what happened. That's exactly what they turned into! I never got &quot;closure&quot; on the perceived offense. I'm sure had I confronted the person it would have just deepened the wound, for both of us. Instead, it was put aside, as an experiment, and something really interesting blossomed in its place. No regrets." created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:01:31 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The point is this -- the resolution can come from you. You don't have to wait for the other person to give it to you, in order to get back on the &quot;good friends&quot; track. But there are other related lessons, and you always have to keep your eyes and ears open, and memory is important -- you should watch for repeat behavior. But it is possible to move on from a hurt without a confrontation. It often is the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; way. " created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:12:44 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The people I admire most are the ones who I am sure have never had a grudge with me. I can think of a few such people. I never have to worry that I need to clear the air. Those people are what I think of as best friends. ;-)" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:29:19 GMT"/>

Scroll down to the heading &quot;A new form of social behavior.&quot; I attract a lot of hate, of course I know it. I can hear their voices in my head, as I write something that people will object to. I guess part of who you are is determined by what you do in response to those voices. Too often I give into them. When I was first starting out writing on the net, I wasn't so familliar with the voice, so my writing had a breezier more fun style to it. The hate grinds you down. I don't know how to avoid it.

				<outline text="Lately I've been thinking about the idea of planting human intelligence in a computer. If you had asked me about it ten years ago I would have said it'll never happen, but now I'm not so sure." img="http://scripting.com/images/youngMenWithBucketsOnTheirHeads.gif"/>
				<outline text="First, some kind of thinking is already in computers, almost invisibly. Here's an example. I type a lot of text into the browser, Chrome, and it's talking back to the Google servers and is constantly evaluating what I type."/>
				<outline text="Over time it gets better at showing stuff that needs correcting. It started with spelling errors. Now it understands proper names and it can highlight some bad grammar. "/>
				<outline text="Examples:"/>
				<outline text="1. Its sunny today. (Not flagged, but it should be, the correct word is a contraction, &quot;it's&quot; for &quot;it is.&quot;)"/>
				<outline text="2. Bill Gates got her hair done today. (Bill Gates is masculine, should be flagged it should be &quot;his hair.&quot;)"/>
				<outline text="1. I object on principal. (Flagged with a gray underline. Good!)"/>
				<outline text="2. Marylin Monroe. (Red underline, name misspelled.)"/>
				<outline text="3. Yesterday I eat some food. (Not flagged, but &quot;eat&quot; is the wrong tense.)"/>
				<outline text="4. The dog to the moon flew. (Bad grammar, not flagged.)"/>
				<outline text="So this is good. I like it when my computers make my work smarter, automatically without me having to do anything. But I'm not sure this is thinking. It's a lot like data processing, something computers have been doing since the beginning."/>
				<outline text="The tough question is can we make computers think like a human and if we can should we want to? Much of what humans act on is unconscious emotion, not thought, based on how things feel. Should we teach computers to do that? Is that what we had in mind when we talk about computers thinking? "/>
				<outline text="Pop out and look at the big picture. What's been accomplished with human thought? Where did all this thinking lead us to? An over-populated unsustainable civilization. More thinking like that? I hope not! :-)"/>

Sure there are companies involved, but the creative act isn't thought of as a corporate thing (I know some people will say it is, you're entitled to your opinion too.) There's something to be said for writing on your own. You get to do it at your own pace. Go back and re-factor to create a better foundation. Your second hit can be something you do slowly and carefully. Or if you get inspired, you can do it in a weekend. You have freedom now you didn't have the first time around.

Schachter's past developments benefitted from the compatibility the web offered in the 1990s (he developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)&quot;&gt;de.licio.us&lt;/a&gt;, the first popular web-based bookmark manager).

				<outline text="I've never met Costolo. Why is that? I would travel to SF to meet with him. I am a product guy. A lot of the core ideas in Twitter were developed in the blogosphere, and that's where my influence was maximum. Back when we had an open platform that no one controlled. So the first part of cleaning this stuff up, DC should start meeting with people whose ideas he's been building on. Let's start talking. We may not understand each other at first, so we should meet again until we do."/>
				<outline text="Second, let's get the developer community going again. It's far from impossible. Twitter has a good API, and the service is a lot more reliable today than it was when it had an excited developer community. I've heard that investors won't back Twitter-based startups. So what. It doesn't take very much money to get something going, esp now that we have services like Heroku and EC2 to build on. I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; the idea that I don't have to compete with a bunch of frothy bubble-based startups. And the browser as an app platform has grown enormously. Lots of good new tech to build on if Twitter were more encouraging of developers."/>
				<outline text="Earlier, I mentioned that it could be an asset for Twitter not to be product-driven. That eliminates basic conflict with developers. A problem every platform has. The more the platform depends on developers, the more concern there is that the employees of the company will interfere. Twitter has, ironically, a great track record there. Unfortunately they nuked the developers. And that's why you see such a dearth of new ideas in the Twitter community. "/>

				<outline text="I am a relative newcomer to Node, having started developing in it a little over a year ago. I've shipped a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; in Node. All my new server software is running in Node, most of it on Heroku. I love Node. Even though it's a pain in the ass in some ways, I've come to adore the pain, the problems are like crossword puzzles. I feel a real sense of accomplishment when I figure it out. "/>

				<outline text="I am new to Node but I also have a lot of experience with the dynamics Hammer is talking about, in my work with RSS, XML-RPC and SOAP. What he says is right. When you get big companies in the loop, the motives change from what they were when it was just a bunch of ambitious engineers trying to build an open underpinning for the software they're working on. All of a sudden their strategies start determining which way the standard goes. That often means obfuscating simple technology, because if it's really simple, they won't be able to sell expensive consulting contracts. He was right to single out IBM. That's their main business. &quot;RSS&quot; hurt their publishing business because it turned something incomprehensible into something trivial to understand. Who needs to pay $500K per year for a consulting contract to advise them on such transparent technology? They lost business." img="http://scripting.com/2015/01/18/chihuahua.png"/>

Parsing various standard content types. Somehow there didn't end up being eight different versions of the core functionality. That's where the greatness of Node comes from. We may look back on this having been the golden age of Node. "/>
				<outline text="There are reasons why, once a technology becomes popular, it's very hard to add new functionality. All the newcomers want to make a name for themselves by authoring one of the standard packages. Everyone has an idea how it should be done, and won't compromise. So what happens is very predictable, and NOT BAD. The environment stops growing. I saw that happening in RSS, as all the fighting over which way to rip up the pavement and start over took over the mail lists. So when RSS 2.0 came out I froze it. No more innovation. That's it. It's finished. If you want to do new stuff, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#roadmap&quot;&gt;start a module&lt;/a&gt; (very much like the NPM packages of Node). Luckily, at that moment, I had the power to do that, as Joyent did with Node, when embarking on this ill-advised foundation track."/>
				<outline text="Now there are many things about Node culture that I don't understand, being a newbie, as I am. But based on what I know about technology evolution from other contexts, the lack of motion at Joyent wasn't a problem, it was realistic. It was what I, as a removed-from-the-fray developer &lt;i&gt;want. &lt;/i&gt;I want this platform to stay what it is. I want to rock and roll in my software, not be broken every time someone decides we should hit the ball from one side of the plate, then the other, then back to the original. Nerd debates about technology never end, until someone puts their foot down and says, no more debates, it's done. And the confusion in those debates is always manipulated by the BigCo's who have motives that we'd be happier not really understanding. I know I would be. Nightmarish stuff. "/>
				<outline text="I love Node. I want it to be solid, that's the most important thing to me. I'd love to see a list, in a very simple newbie-friendly language, that explains what it is that Node needs so desperately to justify both the fork, and the establishment of this foundation. Seems to me we might be pining for the good old days of last year before too long. ;-("/>
				<outline text="PS: Hat-tip to the io.js guys. In the RSS world, the forkers claimed the right to the name. At least you guys had the grace to start with a new name, so as not to cause the kind of confusion the RSS community had to deal with."/>

				<outline text="This is really a very simple idea, but a hard one for a lot of people to grasp, probably due to the way our culture mystifies personal relationships. In the classic romance, the Other is only thought to really love you if they can anticipate your every need. If they can read your mind. This is actually an infantile version of love. A parent has to be able to discern the needs of an infant who doesn't have language to explain that his or her diaper needs changing, or has gas, or feels vulnerable and needs a hug, or whatever. It's a guessing game, but there's no choice. But once we develop language, you no longer have to guess what The Other is feeling, &lt;i&gt;he or she can tell you. &lt;/i&gt;" img="http://scripting.com/2015/02/22/meyou.png"/>
				<outline text="There's a great scene in one of my favorite movies, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Good_as_It_Gets&quot;&gt;As Good As It Gets&lt;/a&gt;, where Melvin is doing something very sweet for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JMv-E9vt48&quot;&gt;Verdell&lt;/a&gt;, the dog. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/02/22/awww.png&quot;&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; says &quot;I want to be treated like that.&quot; What she's really saying is she misses being a baby. It's a fine feeling, because it really was, for many of us, great being an infant. But it's a bad basis for an &lt;i&gt;adult&lt;/i&gt; relationship. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;Good fences make good neighbors&quot; comes from a famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/mending-wall&quot;&gt;Robert Frost poem&lt;/a&gt;, and I think he's being ironic, but it's still true. If you want to really love someone, you have to always recognize that they are a separate person, and unless you ask, you do not know how they're feeling, or what they really mean, etc. The opposite is true. Unless you've said something, clearly, your husband or wife has no idea what you think. It's so boring to have to say everything, but that's how you stay sane and build trust. "/>
				<outline text="Imagine a relationship as a circle, and draw a vertical line through it. On one side, write the other person's name, and write your name on the other side. You stay in your side, and they stay in theirs. You can touch, share, admire each other, tell jokes, share truths, but only from your side of the line. Once you put your presence in their body and start talking about what they think or see, you've just been invasive. It's a form of abuse, a violation, a psychic rape. Most relationships are complete sloshes, with people all over the place all the time, you never know who's where when. No wonder no one trusts each other! You can't trust someone if you never know when they'll show up inside your body, without permission."/>
				<outline text="Over the years, I've kept friendships with people who are good at this separation. It's how we get to be intimate, because it's safe to do so. The ones that have fallen away are those where the Other thinks they know what you really mean, even if it isn't anything you said or did. As Melvin said in As Good As It Gets, &quot;this is exhausting.&quot; Keeping the Other on their side of the line, after a while, gets too much, and you choose to spend your time with other Others."/>

				<outline text="#### Tweets are objects"/>
				<outline text="Twitter calls them tweets, but in programming terms, they are objects."/>
				<outline text="Objects have attributes. If an object has a picture attached to it, that should not be represented as part of the text attribute of the object. There should be a separate attribute for each picture. Yet, totally for historic reasons, that's how it works in Twitter."/>
				<outline text="Note that in the API they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; objects. It's just in the UI that they aren't. That seems wrong." created="Fri, 13 Feb 2015 16:18:10 GMT"/>
				<outline text="#### Hyperlinks are mature technology, let's use them"/>
				<outline text="When Twitter was invented we already had conventions for embedding addresses in text. They are called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink&quot;&gt;hyperlinks&lt;/a&gt;. I think Twitter's designers should decide if they want to have hyperlinks, and if so they should support them the way the web does. There was no good reason to make it work differently. I guess at the time Twitter had problems scaling their servers, so that's where their attention was focused. But those days are behind us."/>
				<outline text="#### Neaten up tweets, get rid of the dangling URLs"/>
				<outline text="Seriously, the onboarding process of Twitter is made more difficult and confusing for people because of all those URLs dangling all over the place. When showing a non-technical user Twitter you have to tell them to ignore those things. Or try to explain why some tweets have two URLs and what they mean. It's 2015. It's almost ten years. Wouldn't it be great to finish this product, really, before it turns ten?"/>
				<outline text="Make images an attribute (actually in some cases I think they are). Or allow text to be hyperlinked. Even better: do both. "/>
				<outline text="#### 140 character limit? Give it up"/>
				<outline text="And while you're at it, let us put more than 140 chars in a tweet. Yes I know the drill, it's supposed to be better if people are forced to be concise. To which I say &quot;Have you looked at your timeline recently?&quot; There are lots of ways to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be concise, and people are using all of them. Give it up. It's over. And btw there are plenty of important, good ideas that require more than 140. "/>
				<outline text="#### Hashtags are intimidating, they could be easy, even fun"/>
				<outline text="Another thing: It should be easy to ask Twitter what a given hashtag means. If necessary use Mechanical Turk to implement this. In this area, Twitter is mysterious and difficult for newbies and experts alike. These are easy fixes. At some point Twitter stopped improving. Use some of the resources you have to fix them!

				<outline text="Anyway the retirement community story said something. They've thought of everything by now. There isn't room to be innovative in lifestyle anymore.

Did you see what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZY8aDg_dTI&quot;&gt;Joni Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; says about Bob Dylan? She looks like my grandmother!

				<outline text="Here's the thing: it's got to be even worse for young people with kids today. That feeling that everything is all figured out.

And his big ideas didn't turn out to be very great either. Just that he could be an asshole to the Republicans and they might relate to that, appreciate that, respect that. It was true back at the beginning and he should have been doing that all along.

Because the lawyers and entrepreneurs of tech are learning, and they're getting better at grabbing, and users are not acting in their self-interest, any more than they were when Facebook and YouTube were taking over." created="Tue, 10 Feb 2015 15:10:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="But even today it's not too late. Because economically and technically, we could reproduce what we have on Facebook on open systems, where everyone controls their own space, without signing over the kinds of rights that make users feel used. We saw some of the enthusiasm when Diaspora launched a few years ago, but they were college students, and weren't realistic about how to bootstrap such a system. You might say But Zuck was a college student when he booted up Facebook. But that system got to grow slowly, and their mistakes weren't exposed so quickly because they were small when they happened. If you wanted to boot up something that would do what Facebook does, today, you'd have to be prepared for a much bigger user community, almost immediately.

This makes it possible for unpopular ideas to be expressed. And if you know history, the most important ideas often are the unpopular ones."/>
				<outline text="Me, I like diversity of opinion. I learn from the extremes. You think evolution is a liberal plot? Okay, I disagree, but I think you should have the right to say it, and further you should have a place to say it. You think global warming is a lie? Speak your mind brother. You thought the war in Iraq was a bad idea? Thank god you had a place you could say that. That's what's important about blogs, not that people can comment on your ideas. As long as they can start their own blog, there will be no shortage of places to comment. What there is always a shortage of, however, is courage to say the exceptional thing, to be an individual, to stand up for your beliefs, even if they aren't popular."/>
				<outline text="I sat next to Steven Levy the other night at dinner in NY. He volunteered that in his whole career he had never written a word that wasn't approved of by someone else, until he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenlevy.com/&quot;&gt;started a blog&lt;/a&gt;. I applaud him for crossing the line. I give him a lot of credit for writing without a safety net. It really is different. Comments wouldn't make the difference, what makes the difference is standing alone, with your ideas out there, with no one else to fault for those ideas. They are your responsibility, and yours alone."/>
				<outline text="For me, the big rush came when I started publishing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt; essays in late &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/index.html#y1994&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;. I would revise and edit, for an hour maybe more, before hitting the Send button. Once I did that, there was no turning back. The idea was out there, with my name on it. All the disclaimers (I called the essays &quot;Amusing rants from Dave Winer's desktop&quot;) wouldn't help, if the ideas were bad, they were mine. But if they were good, they were mine too. &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; what makes something blog-like, imho."/>

				<outline text="In April last year I decided it was time for me to get my Twitter act together in my new JavaScript-based work environment. Back when I was working primarily in &quot;Frontier&quot;, and before the great breakup with Twitter and app developers, I had a pretty easy Twitter programming interface. I wanted the same thing for apps written in JavaScript in the browser." created="Thu, 05 Feb 2015 23:04:51 GMT" img="http://scripting.com/2015/02/05/drinkTheKoolAid.png"/>
				<outline text="It took a total of about two months from beginning to end to get it all working and to get a few &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/07/16/myLatestSoftwareSnacks.html&quot;&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; built on top of it to prove that I had a complete interface.

Nope. It took two &lt;i&gt;days.&lt;/i&gt; That's because Facebook had written a special &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/reference/FB.api&quot;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; for browser-based JavaScript apps that hides all the details of connecting with Facebook from the browser." created="Thu, 05 Feb 2015 23:06:22 GMT"/>

				<outline text="At that point I realized that what I had in my glue for Twitter had value on its own. There was no other Node.js package that was as complete or easy. So I spent some time cleaning it up and adding S3-based storage (all apps &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/01/22/allAppsNeedStorage.html&quot;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; storage), and last month I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/01/23/nodestorageNow.html&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; it as MIT-licensed open source." created="Thu, 05 Feb 2015 23:08:04 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Now, I understand some people feel burned by Twitter, and don't want to risk building on its API, but &quot;nodeStorage&quot; takes a lot of the risk out of it.

They want publishers to post full content to Facebook. In return they are willing to share ad revenue with the publishers."/>
				<outline text="The reason this is so important? In a mobile environment, clicking on a link to read a story is a very big price. We all know that mobile is where Facebook's growth is coming from. News reading on mobile can become much more fluid. That's what Facebook wants to do. "/>
				<outline text="So, with Facebook getting full content from at least &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; publishers, and the announcements likely coming next week, does Twitter really want to explain the magic of 140, and ancient limits of SMS, or would they rather have an equivalent proposition for publishers? Smartphones aren't just the future, they're here, now. It seems like this is the moment to say 140 was nice, it got us to where we are, but now because of mobile, we have to get more text from publishers, if only to remain competitive with Facebook in the one area Twitter still has an advantage (for now) -- news, especially mobile news."/>

This was Medium blinking. I was really surprised they did this. Up to that point I thought Medium was a juggernaut. That they were cleaning up. Apparently not. Apparently they needed to tap into greater growth potential. And if anyone is likely not to be overly respectful of Twitter's internal engine, it's the founder.

				<outline text="A few weeks back, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/a&gt; posted a mysterious message to our support list, saying that blank headlines were showing up in his outline, and wanted to know if we knew what the problem was. " created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:14:29 GMT" img="http://scripting.com/2015/04/30/drNick.png"/>
				<outline text="This is the kind of &quot;bug report&quot; that makes programming for users so frustrating. You hear a user is losing data, but have absolutely no idea how to reproduce the problem. It's something you've never seen the software do, can't imagine it actually doing. The description sounds like  magic, but nothing in software happens by magic, all programmers will tell you. I believe it's happening but I have no idea why." created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:15:05 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, the problem was still happening. We needed to get to the bottom of it. So I added a bit of instrumentation to the app. Every second it would look at all the headlines in the outline and count the number of empty ones, displaying the result on the screen. If it was greater than zero the message would show up in red. I wanted to be sure Doc would see it, the instant it happened." created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:16:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I called him on Skype and said he should use the software as normal, and when he saw the number go above zero, to stop and think &lt;i&gt;What Did I Just Do,&lt;/i&gt; and write me an email. This was my hope to try to get somewhere in the vicinity of reproducible. " created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:17:24 GMT"/>
				<outline text="He said it's reporting 9 empty headlines now. Okay, go through the outline, find them and fix them. Get that number down to 0 so we can start debugging." created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:18:29 GMT"/>
				<outline text="So he did, and we talked a bit about this process while he was doing it. " created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:19:10 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Then when he was done, he was mousing around the outline and it happened. A headline disappeared." created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:19:23 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I said loudly, now stop! Don't touch anything. Key question: What were you doing?" created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:19:35 GMT"/>
				<outline text="He said he was scrolling around the outline and scrolled back to the top and that was when he discovered the headline was empty." created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:19:54 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Turns out it was very important just how he was scrolling around. He was using Pageup and Pagedown, two keys I never use. But for Doc they're central. And when he'd press Pageup or Pagedown, it would wipe out the bar cursor headline. Bing!" created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:20:36 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Would it do it on my machine? Drumroll please -- yes it would. So now the bug was trapped. I told Doc we had arrived at the Holy Moment in debugging -- reproducibility. I told him &quot;reproducible&quot; is the programmer's favorite word. If you can tell me the steps to reproduce the problem, then I can find it and fix it. Until it's reproducible all I can do is share your frustration." created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:21:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="There's a lot more to say about this. I asked Doc to write this up from his point of view. For me it was a breakthrough. Finally, a user who is working on the team with me, to help make the software work better. " created="Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:22:38 GMT"/>

				<outline text="1. Net connections were so slow that the click-wait problem was interfering with people using big media objects, and "/>
				<outline text="2. The mobile devices that could play podcasts weren't able to communicate. "/>
				<outline text="So we designed a protocol that would make it easy for your desktop computer to gather up the media objects and move them to your mobile device, probably something like an iPod, which, by the way, didn't exist yet. "/>
				<outline text="We got ahead of where the technology actually was. But it turned out well. Today there's an explosion of podcast content, all of it formed around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/11/payloadsForRss.html&quot;&gt;blueprint&lt;/a&gt; we put out 14 years ago. "/>
				<outline text="#### Today's net is better"/>
				<outline text="But the world today is different, and as a result I believe we can make podcasting much easier and richer for the listener. We can remove steps, and provide more variety."/>
				<outline text="1. The net we use today is fast. When you click to listen to a 40-minute podcast, it's downloaded in a few seconds. And it starts playing immediately. No click-wait. "/>
				<outline text="2. The net goes with us almost everywhere with inexpensive mobile devices.  "/>
				<outline text="Given that reality, one would design podcast listening software somewhat differently."/>
				<outline text="#### The problem is discovery"/>
				<outline text="We're all looking for the next great podcast, not something to subscribe to necessarily, that's work -- rather something enjoyable, interesting, stimulating, thought-provoking and most important -- *now!*"/>
				<outline text="#### The perfect podcast client"/>
				<outline text="Here's how the perfect podcast client would work, imho."/>
				<outline text="1. No preparation. When I'm leaving the house, I have lots of things on my mind. I spend time loading up my phone with fresh podcasts, when I have the time, but sometimes I'm in a rush and leave with nothing interesting on my phone. "/>
				<outline text="2. Lots of interesting shows. That's a key point. I'm less interested in subscribing to a &lt;i&gt;series&lt;/i&gt; of shows than I am in listening to a single good episode. "/>
				<outline text="3. Social connection. I like to listen to the same shows my friends are listening to, because I love having someone to discuss these things with. "/>
				<outline text="4. Variety. I had gotten into a groove, listening to a few podcasts regularly because I could count on them being interesting to me. Mostly Planet Money and Fresh Air, with a very rare RadioLab, or a NYT Book Review podcast. But there's a lot more out there, I'm finding, now that I have easy access to more variety."/>
				<outline text="5. Immediate. When I decide to listen I want to listen now. It should be as easy to start listening to an episode of a podcast as it is to start watching a different show on my cable TV set-top box. "/>
				<outline text="6. Ephemeral. You listen to a podcast once, and that's it. Yet the devices we use for playback are designed for music, which is not ephemeral. "/>
				<outline text="#### Where from here"/>
				<outline text="For a while I evangelized editorial organizations to create this product, but they either didn't understand the need, or didn't think there was an opportunity? More likely they don't think like a software developer. When I see an opportunity to make things work better, I want it to happen right now. Even if I don't have time to do the work myself."/>
				<outline text="Well, I finally got tired of waiting. I've made the software. I'm using it now, as are a few friends. We're smoothing things out and should have something for everyone to use soon."/>
				<outline text="We're going to start with the shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/337761226431289?pnref=story&quot;&gt;my friends recommended&lt;/a&gt;, when I asked them, on Facebook.

				<outline text="Not sure what direct benefit would be for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scoble.org/&quot;&gt;Scoble&lt;/a&gt;, other than to know that he gave back a little of the flow that the web has given him. A bit of the attention. Maybe developers can do something with this.

We all try to give to charity when we can, and help out people, again when we can. Why? Because it feels good. This is one of the things human beings do. " created="Sat, 11 Apr 2015 16:47:00 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I liken the VC-based tech industry, which Scoble is very much a part of, to the coal industry before we became aware of the damage that fossil fuel does to the climate. In tech, we're early on this, but &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; is the time to catch the problem before it's much more expensive and takes more time to fix. I said this to Bill Gates as he was amassing his fortune, that a little kindness to the ecosystem now will go much further than all the philanthropy you promise later. I say it to Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to Robert Scoble. Be a leader. Show people that freedom matters. Show the tech industry too. Eventually they're going to want more open formats and protocols to build on. How are we going to make them without users like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scoble.org/&quot;&gt;Scoble&lt;/a&gt; helping out. We can't create in a vacuum, without users.

Put your response on a new blog you start, on Tumblr if you like, it's part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem, or WordPress, another company that's raised huge VC. Let's accentuate the good that tech does, by supporting it. Thanks for listening. " created="Sat, 11 Apr 2015 16:51:14 GMT"/>

So I went to the bank, got the cash, drove down to the valley, and was in the middle of the incredible media frenzy when Scoble and Patrick came out of the store, to the applause of the Apple people.

And even if you couldn't do it with a toolbar, Google and Mozilla both own popular browsers. They could modify content any time they want. HTTPS won't protect us against their snooping and interference. Why are we supposed to trust them more than an ISP? I don't actually trust them that much, btw."/>

How about developing competition that doesn't do it, so everyone has a choice? That's the way Google is changing how ISPs work in the US. Why not elsewhere?

				<outline text="I really appreciate the service that Heroku runs. It was a very easy way for me to get started in Node.js, and also very affordable! I kept marveling at what a great deal it was, gushed publicly about it, and paid them the highest honor, I developed my software around their architecture, so it would be really easy to deploy my stuff on Heroku." created="Tue, 12 May 2015 17:54:27 GMT" img="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/11/19/shuttle.gif"/>
				<outline text="My basic idea is that  back-ends for software are very small things. They just move data out of the app, which runs in the browser on the user's desktop, to a storage place, and back out later. That's all the server has to do. " created="Tue, 12 May 2015 17:55:59 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I designed it so that each app has its own server. That way if one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallpicture.com/&quot;&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; got really popular, it wouldn't interfere with the others. This is ideal for developers, to have scaling be a totally fluid thing. That's why you want to chop the pieces as small as you can. Rather than try to host ten apps on a server, give each app their own server, no matter how small and insignificant. It's a design that can only work for a system like Heroku. It was really a breakthrough." created="Tue, 12 May 2015 17:56:48 GMT"/>
				<outline text="But, they changed their pricing so as to really discourage this architecture. It's possible they weren't even aware how their change would affect us. I didn't hide the design, I wrote lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/01/23/nodestorageNow.html&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/02/05/whyNodestorageIsABigDeal.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; it. I emailed with people there. I even met with their CEO on a trip to California to talk about how I saw their service and to learn how they were planning to evolve it. I kept emailing them asking if they were sure this is the deal and thanking them for their generosity. " created="Tue, 12 May 2015 17:58:19 GMT"/>
				<outline text="But once they changed, I had to change. It no longer made sense to have lots of individual servers, one for each app. With the new economics. I'd have to bundle them up, the old way, where one server is running N apps. And if one gets successful, there's a bunch of manual work to set things up so it gets more resources without slowing the other apps down. Scaling is no longer a matter of sliding a slider on a browser interface. I wish it were. " created="Tue, 12 May 2015 17:59:32 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Anyway it's up to them to decide how to price their service. And it was up to me to migrate when they changed their pricing.

This was a very high wire balancing act. But it was a good thing to do, now I have a much better understanding of what I've done. I've moved code I wrote when I was a total newcomer to Node.js.

In his post he cites a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/04/24/iWouldHaveHiredDougEngelbart.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I  wrote about how I would have hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart&quot;&gt;Doug Engelbart&lt;/a&gt;, when I was running my first startup in the 80s. His piece is getting a lot of traffic. That's good. I'm glad people are thinking about this. "/>
				<outline text="My saying I would have hired Doug Engelbart in the 1980s means nothing about the job market in 2015. What I would have done in 1985 is irrelevant today. I'm not hiring. And I'm pretty sure my counterpart in 2015 doesn't feel the way I might have felt then. "/>
				<outline text="I might have hired Engelbart because his work laid the foundation for the work we were doing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt;. He felt his work wasn't finished. We could have helped him achieve his vision, and he could have helped us make our software more useful. Perhaps we could have skipped years of evolution, avoiding the blind alleys he had to back out of in his earlier work."/>
				<outline text="Now the big wheel has turned and today I'm in the situation Engelbart was in in the 80s. Unlike Engelbart, I have re-tooled. I now work in JavaScript in the browser and on the server. I had to walk away from the codebase that I loved. I understood that the price of relevance is to give up fighting at some point and settle for a partial victory. I think I was right in the development &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; I created. But right doesn't mean the world uses what you created. Maybe 20 or 30 years from now these ideas will have gained traction. I won't be programming then. I almost certainly won't even be alive. "/>
				<outline text="I turned 60 over the weekend. It's a tough birthday, or it was for me. I didn't want to have it in public, so I told Facebook not to announce it. I think younger people don't understand. I finally think I understand &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; they don't understand. The ones that love me say I'm really young, and I appreciate that. I think they mean my thinking is flexible, and I'm excited about the future, like a young person might be. But the clock ticks in predictable ways. My body is that of a 60 year-old. And the world treats me as one as well. Most people can't see or feel the enthusiasm an older person has. Or they don't believe. Or they don't think. "/>
				<outline text="Like Engelbart in the 80s, I feel my work is not done. I still pump out ideas executed in software at an amazing clip. I wonder why people don't wonder how I do it. The processes I use, investing in good tools and underpinnings, and paying attention to good features of other people's software, makes it easy and quick to try out new ideas. Some of them are really worth it. Look at the list of achievements on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallpicture.com/&quot;&gt;smallpicture.com&lt;/a&gt; home page for an idea."/>

He had a day job at Apple as a tester, but contributed his time for free to various developer projects. We were lucky to have him as part of our team on Frontier. When we were preparing a new release, he'd put the product through its paces, and his bug reports were the best, hands down. Never seen anything like it.

If Doc hadn't been willing to come to the phone and work with me, the problem would still be in the software. Who knows how many users suffered silently with this, or worse, just stopped using the product because they thought it was sabotaging their work (in a way it was).

				<outline text="But it's always been a promise, and many have acted in their own self-interest only, and forgot that in order for the open web to thrive we must feed it." created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:39:16 GMT"/>

				<outline text="#### The rule of working together" created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:55:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Working together means this: If someone else has a good-enough way to do something, rather than reinvent what they do, incorporate what they do into what you do." created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:39:53 GMT"/>
				<outline text="There's a flipside. If I have to reinvent your whole product just to get a feature, you're not part of the open web. " created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:56:03 GMT"/>
				<outline text="#### An example of working together" created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:40:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="When I was getting started writing server software in JavaScript, I had a thought not unlike the thought that probably happens at many silo companies. The process went like this: I'm going to need an RSS feed parser. A friend of mine, Dan MacTough, had created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; and released it as open source. I found it confusing. So I decided that this was important enough that I should have &quot;my own&quot; feed parser. " created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:40:33 GMT"/>
				<outline text="However, before I started writing my own, I sat myself down and asked if it would be better for everyone if I created yet another feed parser, or if I used Dan's. I decided, no matter how much work it would be to learn his way of doing it, even if it took longer to use his than to create my own (which also would have been more fun) I would be doing good for the net if I just used his. So I did. No regrets. I still don't understand how it works internally, but I've helped build a network of software, instead of creating another software island." created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:41:55 GMT"/>
				<outline text="And in practical terms, an island is just as isolating as a silo." created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:43:50 GMT"/>
				<outline text="#### Working together means APIs" created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:44:03 GMT"/>
				<outline text="One of the things that's wrong in today's software is people tend to leave off the APIs. Or, if they're VC-funded, they're likely to have the APIs in the beginning, to help attract users and developers, but as they want to become profitable, they restrict the APIs. So much so that many developers no longer trust corporate APIs. Me too. I much prefer open cloneable APIs, with more than one implementer. That makes it impossible for a platform to screw its users and developers, because if they do, no problem -- I'll just use another one." created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:44:19 GMT"/>
				<outline text="One company that's generating a huge unicorn-level market cap is Slack. Hats off to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Butterfield&quot;&gt;Stewart Butterfield&lt;/a&gt;, the founder, and his team, who seem to have managed to create something that's both part of the open web and enormously profitable for investors. Please study this Ms and Mr Venture Capital. Note that strangling your community isn't the only way to get rich. " created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:45:54 GMT"/>
				<outline text="#### Working together means using open software" created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:47:11 GMT"/>
				<outline text="This is the hardest one to explain, because users seem to think they have no power re the open web and no responsibility. But the toys you love, Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat, etc, couldn't have existed if they couldn't have siphoned power from the open web. If you think the toys are getting more similar and perhaps a bit boring, this is why: there hasn't been enough investment in open web tech in the last few years. Not enough know-how for the merchandisers to commercialize." created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:47:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="When a developer ships a tool that doesn't lock you in, it's worth using it, even if there is a &quot;free&quot; one that works a little better or has a nicer design. Because the open one, the one that lets you leave when you want to, preserves freedom, and the others consume it." created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:48:59 GMT"/>
				<outline text="It's really rare in today's world when a normal person has such power to affect the outcome, but every software developer needs users. Even just a few. Without users, how can you tune your software up to fit people who think differently from yourself. And creating new software, at this point in the evolution of this art, is still relatively easy and inexpensive. So a few users can be very powerful, but you have to choose to be. That choice is itself an act of creativity, and working-together." created="Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:49:56 GMT"/>

				<outline text="It's likely this would increase use of Facebook, because people would post stuff there to make notes to themselves and future generations. It certainly wouldn't hurt.

But he seemed to forget each time and kept demanding that I pay. I told him I was going to rate him at one star, he said I shouldn't threaten him, and I said that wasn't a threat, that was my right. So he took me there."/>

But he's also young, and it's easy to get inside his head, and make all that confidence work against the elegance. To be the Curry he must be to win the title, he had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://liveblog.co/users/davewiner/2015/06/08/theEducationOfStephCurry.html&quot;&gt;sober up&lt;/a&gt;. He has.

I would make some unretractable commitments to developers, by releasing lots of the basic Twitter technology as open source, so it could be immediately federated. It might take some time to do it well, and we would take the necessary time. It would guarantee that we'd always have the highest performance, most reliable notification system, or we'd be replaced. Honestly, I'd bet that over time we &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be replaced. But the Internet still needs an identity system.

That would cut back on a bunch of initiatives, so some of the current Twitter employees would go on to start new companies. I'd invest in them, so we could participate in their upside. This would prepare Twitter for mid-life. It's no longer a startup. And now it's time to serve as a true &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html&quot;&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;, as an operating environment, as an organization, and as a bank account. I know this is a radical re-shaping, and it may only be possible if Twitter is acquired, and basically taken private, and I wouldn't have a problem with that as long as one of the terms of the deal is that all this would happen. The idea is to get Twitter back on track to being globally significant. To realize the potential it had when it was a startup almost ten years ago. " created="Sat, 13 Jun 2015 20:42:18 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If the acquirer were Google, btw, I'm pretty sure they'd be happy to go this route, because no matter what their future is tied directly to the future of the open web, and the open web is suffering because of all the silos. One of them is Twitter. Desiloizing Twitter would be a brilliant move, it would strengthen the open web, create vast new developer opportunities, and investment opportunities for the new owners. Google, of course, has much more cash than Twitter, and already realizes that it needs to diversify. Here's a great way to add fuel to the fire." created="Sat, 13 Jun 2015 20:47:20 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Yesterday I did a review of the feeds I follow for tech news, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/354930598047685?pnref=story&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a request to Facebook for people to recommend their favorites. In this review I came across a &quot;MegaFeed&quot; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://glennf.com/&quot;&gt;Glenn Fleishman&lt;/a&gt;, a blogger who also writes for a number of publishers. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=Hu5X_Cge3hGnBSrd6icw5g&amp;_render=rss&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; is stitched together by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/&quot;&gt;Yahoo Pipes&lt;/a&gt;, a service that has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes&quot;&gt;around&lt;/a&gt; for many years. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://pipes.yqlblog.net/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last week that the site will close in September. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.yahoo.com/forums/#/categories/yahoo-pipes&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on Yahoo's support forum."/>
				<outline text="I wondered what will happen to the people who follow feeds produced by Yahoo Pipes? Yahoo doesn't say they'll provide free &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection#HTTP_status_codes_3xx&quot;&gt;redirection&lt;/a&gt;, but it would be good for the web if they did. However, even if they did provide redirection, where would people redirect to? Because Yahoo was a big company people trusted and their service was free, little if any competition developed for Yahoo Pipes. Either way, it's a clear example of why it's not good to depend on free commercial services to form critical parts of your content infrastructure. "/>
				<outline text="Then I read stories on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/whats-going-on-at-medium#.hv98XBVPO&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/medium-budget-cuts-and-restructuring-2015-6&quot;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2015/05/21/medium-twitter-network-effect/&quot;&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; about recent changes at Medium, another site where people post their ideas, instead of posting to a blog that they pay for and control. "/>
				<outline text="When people post to Medium they think about exposure for their ideas today, but imho they should also be thinking about how people are going to find their ideas in the future. There's no guarantee that Medium won't shift strategy again, or shut down. It happens all the time in the tech world. With no way to dual-host content, and no guarantee of future redirection, Medium is not a very future-safe place to post. "/>
				<outline text="But even sites like Tumblr and WordPress.com that look stable are still subject to corporate changes or disappearance. "/>
				<outline text="What we need, and still don't have, is a systematic way of publishing to the future. Such a system would allow you to pay a fixed sum to keep your content at a specific address for the foreseeable future. No one can make a guarantee, we don't know what the future holds, but every effort has to be made, upfront, to be sure that the content has the best chance to survive as long as possible. "/>
				<outline text="It would be nice if a visionary entrepreneur would get involved, and an educational institution, perhaps, and/or an insurance company, the kinds of organizations our society creates to be long-lived. It would be great to get input from Stewart Brand and his colleagues at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://longnow.org/&quot;&gt;LongNow Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. "/>
				<outline text="I've said this many times, it bears saying again. I've been aware of this problem for a long time, and I'm hosting a lot of archives that should be preserved long-term. I want them to be, I'd be willing to bequeath the funds in my will to keep the content going for the indefinite future, but today there is no way to do it, as far as I know. "/>
				<outline text="PS: People always say &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt; is the answer. Of course I'm aware of that excellent and wonderful service. But long-lived content is not the same thing as having a snapshot. We're building networks here. Archive.org is a museum. I'm very glad it exists. I want something different, a way for the actual content and the networks they're part of, to persist."/>
				<outline text="PPS: An after-the-fact &lt;a href=&quot;http://liveblog.co/users/davewiner/2015/06/07/justOpenSourceIt.html&quot;&gt;open source release&lt;/a&gt; of Yahoo Pipes probably isn't an answer. "/>

			<outline text="How I try to work with journalists" created="Mon, 01 Jun 2015 18:25:27 GMT" flMarkdown="true" isFeedItem="true" name="howITryToWorkWithJournalists" type="outline">
				<outline text="I read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoverspill.wordpress.com/2015/05/29/great-lies-of-our-time-journalists-and-coders-should-sit-together-to-create-amazing-stuff/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Charles Arthur thinking maybe this is the breakthrough. Maybe we can start this discussion in earnest. Maybe in fact a lot was gained by putting programmers and journalists in the same room, if only to prove that's not the way to do it! :-)"/>
				<outline text="Here's how I think it should work, and I think the germ of the idea is there in Charles' piece. He says he is an amateur programmer. He can do some PHP and AppleScript. In the past he's worked a bit in COBOL and C++. That's awesome. We can use that."/>
				<outline text="How about if we make great tools that are designed for people like Charles to create their own wonderful web projects. "/>
				<outline text="Two good things could come from it. " created="Mon, 01 Jun 2015 18:36:09 GMT"/>
				<outline text="1. They might make some good software. Don't doubt it. One of my best programmer buddies was a lawyer. He had a good programmer mind, but hadn't really exercised it. Now he teaches me stuff about Node.js. By giving ever-easier and less complex development tools to people who aren't developers, we're going to as a result find some of them are better devs than they are journalists. I believe those people will be uniquely able to listen to journalists, because inside their own mind there is one. ;-)"/>
				<outline text="2. They might create a breakthrough. It might also be an egregious hack, that you can't believe a human mind could possibly do it so wrong, but it might still be a great idea! That's exactly how Adam Curry showed me how to do the &quot;last yard&quot; idea he wanted to do that resulted in podcasting. He took my source code, and hacked it in awful egregious ways (I can't say that enough) but it did something I had not thought of. He had tried to explain it in words, but couldn't get through my thick skull. But showing me that he believed in the idea enough to so thoroughly humiliate himself was enough to get me to listen."/>
				<outline text="There probably are other great reasons, but these are two that I have personally experienced, so can vouch for the fact that they're real. "/>
				<outline text="So believing this, for a very long time actually, I have been working at trying to lower the barriers. I called one of my companies UserLand, because I wanted the users more involved in creating software. "/>
				<outline text="I have shipped a bunch of tools that make it easy for an inspired user to cobble together their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagepark&quot;&gt;web server&lt;/a&gt;, their own CMS, without the limits of the software that was created by a priesthood, one that's invested in keeping things complicated and inaccessible. (I'm sure journalists are familiar with the idea of an elite priesthood.) "/>
				<outline text="That's why I say to Charles, to think of all programmers as having the same outlook, the same goals, is as ridiculous as thinking all columnists and reporters do. I want you to win. Most of the others don't really care if you do or don't. "/>
				<outline text="I keep saying this, let's work together. Maybe now we can?"/>
