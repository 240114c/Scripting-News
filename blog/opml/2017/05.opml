It was a good demo, but when I was done I couldn't find the little controller window that lets you stop recording.

There are a couple of other pubs I'd subscribe to if the price were more reasonable, considering I only exceed their quota of free stories by about the middle of the month. The New Yorker is one for sure. And there are free-to-read pubs that deserve some of the money too, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog&quot;&gt;TPM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/author/Jonathan%20Chait/&quot;&gt;New York Mag&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="JSON in Feed Land" created="Tue, 30 May 2017 15:18:54 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="The last couple of weeks the idea of feeds that do more or less what RSS does, in JSON instead of XML, has been under consideration." created="Tue, 30 May 2017 15:19:03 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/05/30/elephant.png"/>
					<outline text="At the same time I was working on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, codenamed &lt;i&gt;Old School. &lt;/i&gt;In doing the work, I found a bunch of problems with the code I was using to generate RSS feeds. I wrote it a long time ago, probably when I was first doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of it came from &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;. It had an assumption baked into it that the items in the feed all went to or came from Twitter. That's not an assumption I can make about my current software. Twitter is important, but it's not &lt;i&gt;everything. &lt;/i&gt;;-)" created="Tue, 30 May 2017 15:23:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I decided to try an experiment. In addition to writing the feed in XML, I also wrote it in JSON. It's a very simple matter. I had done a prototype of it in 2012, that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rssjs.org/&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;. The comment thread there is very interesting. It is itself a historic document with comments from people who had strong opinions when core RSS was being discussed in the late 90s and early 00s." created="Tue, 30 May 2017 15:24:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One &lt;a href=&quot;http://rssjs.org/#comment-652876959&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; in particular, from Julian Bond, someone who rarely agreed with or supported my ideas, had a bit of advice that was, to me, stunning. He argued for not re-litigating the old disputes, and just accept RSS as-is, with all the scars and false starts in place. Of course he had no argument with me. That's exactly what i intended to do. I wasn't signing up for more years of misery on mail lists. I made a conscious decision about that in 2002. Never went back, never want to.  " created="Tue, 30 May 2017 15:26:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Chuck Shotton, a longtime friend, provided a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rssjs.org/#comment-645922090&quot;&gt;justification&lt;/a&gt; for JSONifying RSS. It's a good one and one that I hadn't thought of. It's true that today's RSS-reading apps have to have an XML parser, but there may be new apps that are easier to make in JSON. Non-publishing uses for RSS. I tend only to think of publishing, but Chuck does commercial realtime stuff at considerable scale. I trust his judgement, even if I don't always take his advice. :-)" created="Tue, 30 May 2017 15:30:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Back to the JSON version of Scripting's RSS 2.0 feed. The translation is very straightforward. It could have been done algorithmically but I decided to do it by hand, to force me to review and understand every element, not just of the base format, but also for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/a&gt; that I use in all my work. I wanted not only to understand how RSS could be transported with a different syntax, JSON, but also how the extension mechanism would make the jump. It worked without a hitch. And honestly I think it's beautiful. " created="Tue, 30 May 2017 15:32:40 GMT"/>
