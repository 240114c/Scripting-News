So they shipped off three healthy players in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/knicks-trade-for-derrick-rose-send-lopez-grant-to-bulls-grades-takeaways/&quot;&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://nypost.com/2017/04/05/two-ex-knicks-in-derrick-rose-trade-finding-niche-in-chicago/&quot;&gt;two players&lt;/a&gt; with too many miles on their legs.

Win-now is a shitty strategy, esp for the Knicks. Never has a team needed more to see itself as a work in progress. The thing the win-now proponents don't understand is that fans &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; teams with long-term strategies. They might bitch and moan about not winning or contending for a title, but a team with hope draws fan &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/02/25/thisThisIsWhyWeLikeBasketball.html&quot;&gt;interest&lt;/a&gt;.

I know the reality. I live in the middle of NYC. I see a few protests here and there. The police observe, respectfully, no one gets hurt. This is America. If people don't like something they protest. It's a good thing about our country. Free speech. It's in the Constitution. I recall people who didn't like President Obama availed themselves of their First Amendment rights.

					<outline text="That summer was the moment podcasting clicked. I was doing Morning Coffee Notes. Adam had started Daily Source Code. Dawn and Drew. Dave Slusher. Trade Secrets. And more and then even more. What had been an idea was now blossoming into a medium. You could see it happening. Every day was a revelation. So I sought out a meeting with the people at Microsoft who were developing what would become &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune&quot;&gt;Zune&lt;/a&gt;, which was doomed, you could see it, the iPod was too much of a juggernaut. There was no room for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://anildash.com/2006/11/brown-zune.html&quot;&gt;brown&lt;/a&gt; music player &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Zune-Digital-Media-Player-Brown/dp/B000H0QDCC&quot;&gt;device&lt;/a&gt; that did what Apple already did. " created="Thu, 29 Jun 2017 13:02:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But, this new thing, podcasting, needed a player device. The iPod was a terrible player. It was designed for music. You buy music. You store a song on your desktop and mobile device. You listen to a song many times over months or years. " created="Thu, 29 Jun 2017 13:09:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Podcasting was different. You download a podcast as part of a series. It's a subscription. You pay nothing. You listen once and throw it away. Music is permanent, podcasts are ephemeral. A device for listening to podcasts would make it easy to listen to more podcasts. " created="Thu, 29 Jun 2017 13:04:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There was an opening at the time for a device that was insanely great at podcasting. And it would give Microsoft something innovative to promote. A reason for the Zune to exist, at a time when it had none." created="Thu, 29 Jun 2017 13:10:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Unfortunately I learned there, and with all the other interactions with Microsoft, that while they felt they were innovative, they had no appreciation for how innovation happens. It isn't something you put in a budget or a five-year plan. It's something that happens. One day a killer idea shows up out of nowhere, and you have to be prepared to hear it. They were not, clearly, prepared. " created="Thu, 29 Jun 2017 13:06:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A year ago I tried again with Microsoft. I had an idea I thought they needed. They were very nice. They were told I was an industry founder, I guess. But they had no context to understand what I was talking about. You make software you say? Very nice. See you later. " created="Thu, 29 Jun 2017 13:07:25 GMT"/>

Faceook has an extensive vetting process. Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.twitter.com/app/new&quot;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &quot;let a thousand flowers bloom.&quot; I know some people have problems with Twitter, but I've learned over many years that all corporate vendors are imperfect. If you're waiting for &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards#1497798834000&quot;&gt;perfection&lt;/a&gt; you'll wait forever.

Frontier makes this easier in several ways:" created="Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:49:41 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="1. It's synchronous. But then so is Node if you want it to be and for this application I used the synchronous version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/a&gt; routines. To do it asynch would have taken hours. And since this is code that runs at startup, who cares if it hogs the CPU. It runs once and that's it." created="Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:50:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Frontier has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/frontier/blob/master/Common/source/fileloop.c&quot;&gt;fileloop&lt;/a&gt; construct that does all the stuff you have to do explicitly in JS, baked into its kernel. A time and complexity saver. " created="Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:51:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. By far the most important thing is Frontier's integrated debugger. I would use the debugger to write the code. Using it to be sure what values were in what variables to save me the time of having to figure it out. People who haven't worked in an environment where the debgger and editor are the same thing wouldn't understand this. It's the one thing I miss the most. (Node does have a debugger and I use it. I write sloppy first versions so I can get to that point of letting the code speak for itself at runtime.)" created="Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:52:00 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/13/weaselsRippedMyFlesh.png"/>

His posts never have links and no titles, no styling. Just huge numbers of long paragraphs one after the other. That's probably one of the reasons I never read his posts. Maybe his thinking doesn't build on other people's ideas either? I've never met Zuck. Maybe that tells you something. Do you think the Beatles met Chuck Berry?

You have to belong to a very exclusive club to be invited to post on their site. You have to know someone. And they have to like you. And that keeps out the truly good ideas. I know that when I read the NYT. I am welcome to read, and to pay, but my ideas aren't good enough to appear alongside the writers of the NYT. So they're even more of a silo than FB.

I wanted to see if there was interest among developers for a JSON version of RSS. I put up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rssjs.org/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with comments, and added a JSON feed to my blog (technically it was JSONP). Wired even asked me to write a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2012/09/rss-in-json-for-real/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about it.

I was concerned about whether there was demand for JSON syntax among people who actually produce feeds and write software that consumes feeds. I understand how developers feel, but how many of them are responsible for the flow of RSS-based news? I was also concerned because they were creating new names for things that already existed in RSS 2.0. I had the same concern with Atom, many years ago.

					<outline text="First, I've asked, and the reason they don't like Twitter is that they fucked over their developers. It's true. I was one of them. I had a sizable base of Twitter software.

				<outline text="Yesterday I made it so that I can edit the icon bar in the outliner I use to write this blog. But I made it so that I can only edit a few of the icons. Now I think I should be able to edit all of them, and change the order, or the icons. I also want to put them in a special out of the way place so they feel like hardware to the non-tinkering user. Nothing worse than giving a person who's not paying attention such powerful and potentially destructive tools. Kind of like El Presidentè. ;-)" created="Thu, 01 Jun 2017 12:19:05 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="Here's what I think. Our govt is being run for the benefit of Russian oligarchs. Figure out what this means for real Americans, the people (you hope) watch your show. I also think there's a good chance the petulant president, angry over the investigation he can't stop with charm and arm-twisting, plans to punish the US until we drop the investigation. A move toward blackmail and hostage-taking. And guess who the hostages are. (You and me and everyone within range of our military.)" created="Thu, 01 Jun 2017 12:22:40 GMT"/>
