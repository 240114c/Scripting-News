					<outline text="This a really nerdy post. " created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:14:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="ES6 is the newest version of JavaScript, and it's gradually making its way into online docs and browser runtimes everywhere. " created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:14:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I'm starting to use one of its features, and am reluctantly having to use others, and looking forward to one being more broadly deployed. " created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:15:18 GMT" flNumberedSubs="true">
						<outline text="The feature I am using is &lt;i&gt;let. &lt;/i&gt;It should have been the way declarations worked everywhere. You should be able to very precisely determine the scope of a variable by its placement. The crazyass way &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; worked in JavaScript was one of its worst features. &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; fixes that. I can't see why you would ever not use let. Except of course if you're using &lt;i&gt;const.&lt;/i&gt; Another feature, borrowed from Pascal (and #define in C) that's very useful. It's already caught a bug for me. When something really can't change you should use const." created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:15:57 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Even though names &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html&quot;&gt;don't&lt;/a&gt; matter, I think &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; should have been called &lt;i&gt;local. &lt;/i&gt;It's not clear from the names why &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; is local and &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; is more global. What's really going on is you're declaring a local, so it should have been called that. Regardless I'm happy to have what I regard as a bug fix. (The bugs caused by the way var is specified combined with the way asynch works can be truly spectacular.)" created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:17:29 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The arrow notation for callbacks was uncalled for (heh awkward wording). What's the savings? Not having to include the word &lt;i&gt;function? &lt;/i&gt;Really. We had a standard way to document callbacks. Now we have two ways. That's going in the wrong direction. (And we have two more ways, see the next section.)" created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:18:25 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I don't like the new async version of promises which was a flawed improvement on callbacks. I think I don't mind &lt;i&gt;callback hell&lt;/i&gt; so much because I edit in an outliner. If I wrote in a flat editor I can imagine I'd be desperate for something to unwind the indentation. As an outliner user, it's kind of cool in a Stockholm Syndrome kind of way. The problem is that people are going to ship sample code using all the fanciest new contraptions, making things that you want to be easy more complex. It's like using CoffeeScript for sample code. Please, just stick to basic common JavaScript (an idea that might be worth exploring)." created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:19:04 GMT"/>
						<outline text="And the feature I'm anxiously awaiting are modules in the browser. I wish there were exactly Node packages. They seem to be &lt;i&gt;inspired&lt;/i&gt; by them instead. In any case modules will improve my client coding enormously. They take me back to my UCSD Pascal days in the late 70s which had units, which were even nicer (if I recall correctly) than today's modules. Nonetheless the ability to create your own APIs as a routine matter is essential for good development. " created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:21:18 GMT"/>
						<outline text="So much of the evolution of JavaScript has been an attempt to humanize the wrong way it does async. All that bullshit should have been buried in the runtime. That would be orders of magnitude faster and less error-prone for the human beings writing the software, and I bet you can even do optimizations in the runtime that make it faster. JavaScript will never be as easy as other Algol-like languages, and none of the patches and weird constructs will fix that, they only succeed in making it even more complex. That said, you can pry the JavaScript from my dead cold hands. This is the language I'm using, and that's that. " created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:34:38 GMT"/>
						<outline text="No doubt my friend Allen Wirfs-Brock who was the editor of the ES6 spec will have explanations for all this or at least stories to go with why they did what they did. ;-)" created="Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:20:16 GMT"/>

And you can tell that the people he interviews, who are all &lt;a href=&quot;http://nytimesriver.com/&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt; reporters, feel that way too. It wasn't like that at first. I don't think they knew why they were doing it. Now I think the Daily must be catching on inside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyt&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;. The reporters are all very different people. Yesterday's was especially illuminating. I love seeing a venerable old newspaper transition to another great new medium. To help define that medium.

They come from the same place, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens&quot;&gt;as do I&lt;/a&gt;. I went to school with kids who were like Trump, kids who had KKK/Nazi parents, who felt they were of superior stock. In fact, Trump sometimes reminds me of people in my own family.

				<outline text="A general note about transmitting money via the net. None of the services I've tried give you any idea up front how the process will work. How will the person be notified? What are the requirements on their end? In one case the person had to have an account at the same bank I was using. That was not said before I sent the money. I once tried sending money via Facebook, figuring they would have worked to get the glitches out. Nope. It took days for the money to clear at the other end, which wasn't overseas, it was &lt;i&gt;California&lt;/i&gt; for crying out loud. Sending a gift certificate through Amazon to a relative in the UK was also a bad experience. She had to spend the money at Amazon in the US, which meant shipping costs to the UK would have been huge. They didn't say this up front, or I would have used Amazon UK to give the gift. We've been using the web for commerce for 20 years.

I was regularly pointing to Doc from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, because his writing was so good and perspectives about the net so valuable. Six months. You have to show people steadiness. Update even if they aren't reading in the numbers you'd like. Keep doing it. It takes time to build up a trust, a pattern, a habit. And that's what reading a blog is, a habit. Conclusion: If there's a will to reboot blogging, we have to create that kind of habit, across a number of sites.

By the time Maddow was over it was just one more thing. She did run a clip of Fox, when first processing the press conference. It was cause for hope.

The answer is yes. The same way Al Qaeda and ISIS crave publicity for their atrocities, American terrorists use publicity to drive recruitment, to grow, so the next march and uprising is bigger. More campus invasions. A clash between the First and Second Amendments. Liberal college towns: Austin, Berkeley, Madison, Ann Arbor, Boulder, Cambridge, Portland, Raleigh. Every time POTUS does a press conference and whistles loudly saying he's behind the movement, expect more deplorables to step up. The people at the marches looked like people who last year at this time were going to Trump campaign rallies.

					<outline text="In early May I reprovisioned my desktop Mac because the machine was performing badly, and I couldn't figure why.
