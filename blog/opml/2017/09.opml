				<outline text="When designing a promotional website, ask yourself this question. What would a visitor want to know. And then make sure the questions are answered on the home page of the site, near the top, in plain language. For example, if you're hosting an event, the basic info is -- 1. Where. 2. When. 3. How much. 4. What is it for. 5. Who should go. So often none of that information is anywhere in sight, even one click off the home page. Who designs these sites? They often look nice. I think people forget to do this because they already know all that, and they're thinking how to wow you and excite you. It's 2017, soon to be 2018. Websites aren't exciting anymore.

Often someone else's message is a perfect place to make a note. Like in this case -- Why is it heartbreaking? I'm guessing for this reason -- because it's something you're going to miss when life is over. Or something you'd like to share with someone who's no longer here.

					<outline text="I'm. So. Tired. Of. This. It's like that West Wing episode where the president says &quot;Let's just dangle our feet in the water.&quot; They talk about doing all kinds of things, but don't do them. At the end, Leo writes something on a notepad that has been used by real presidents at least a couple of times since -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9-3NxTzQ8&quot;&gt;Let Bartlet Be Bartlet&lt;/a&gt;. Well, it's time to Let Twitter be Twitter, and no, I don't think it has anything to do with the 140-char limit. " created="Wed, 27 Sep 2017 12:51:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think the 140-char limit is something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_memory#640_KB_barrier&quot;&gt;640K limit on PCs&lt;/a&gt;. At first it seemed enough, but then a few years later, memory was full of spreadsheets and word processing documents and TSRs, and all kinds of crazy fixes appeared for extending the memory, and in doing so made the whole thing much more unusable. Along came the Mac with its mouse and graphic user interface, but as a developer, I think the fact that the Mac didn't have the 640K limit was an equally important factor. There were no limits to the Mac's growth for software developers. In this analogy, on Twitter, writers are the developers. And any writer who thinks every idea can be expressed in 140 chars, has imho never seriously used Twitter. " created="Wed, 27 Sep 2017 12:54:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If we're going to &lt;i&gt;Let Twitter Be Twitter, &lt;/i&gt;maybe there are other things that are more important than the 140-char limit? I think of Twitter as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/912863256963817472&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; where newsmakers make news. Where the people who write the news work, and where people who want news gather. It's all focused on news. " created="Wed, 27 Sep 2017 12:56:59 GMT"/>

It was more than 140. And 280 characters would have been enough for all but the longest. " created="Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:13:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Also, just sayin, it isn't really working for Twitter-the-company. I bought a bunch of Twitter stock a couple of years ago, so I could have whatever upside was available, and so I could understand Twitter from the perspective of an investor. When the Knicks were faring as poorly as Twitter is as a stock, they basically got rid of everyone and started over. Sad as I was to say goodbye to JR Smith and Iman Schumpert and everyone else, I had to agree, this isn't working, and it's lunacy to keep betting on a team that's delivering such poor results. " created="Wed, 27 Sep 2017 12:58:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So if you think the 140-char limit is so great, why isn't Twitter making money for its shareholders? If you were management at Twitter would you be conservative or would you take risks? As a shareholder, I want them to take risks. Big ones. Why not? They don't really have anything to lose. " created="Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:00:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It could be that when you remove the 140-char limit, Twitter will just crumble into a mass of servers and Russian bots, and all the good people will go to Ello and Mastodon, or whatever -- maybe Facebook. After all, now that the 140-char limit is gone, why not just go ahead and post unlimited-length messages on Facebook? It could happen that way, but I don't think so." created="Wed, 27 Sep 2017 12:53:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I wish Jack and team would stop dangling their feet in the water and just make the change. I don't think the complaints are real. The people complaining don't &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that easing the limit will screw up Twitter. They say they know, but they don't. If they don't like it they can always unfollow or mute people who use too many characters. But they won't. Users always complain about change. Sometimes they're right, but usually it doesn't make as much of a difference as they think." created="Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:00:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Also, why not make the limit 1000 characters or even 1,000,000? I can attach a video to a tweet that uses more than 1MB. Why not text? I don't see what they have against text. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; for them a couple of years ago that shows how it could be done with zero disruption for 140-char lovers.

				<outline text="For JavaScript nerds, the problem was this. Whenever a new item came in or was updated, I ran a bit of magic jQuery code that caused all links to open in an external window, outside the Electron context. If you let the app run for a while, one click would open five tabs (same link five times). Eventually one click would open 1000 tabs. The problem was fixed by adding a single line of code, to unregister the click handler before re-registering it, assuring that there's only one handler for each link.

It was a great feature, a kind of interprocess communication for Everyman. I wish they had gone the other way and enhanced it, but I understand that it wasn't in their longterm direction. However it is important in &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; longterm direction.

Google continues a long tradition of tech companies holding back progress to maintain their dominance.  The web and blogging and have allowed us to circumvent this, to some extent. BTW, of course it's not just Google. There's a continuous chain of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt; tech companies going back to the beginning. They all do it.

How many IBM people hid behind that excuse for not doing something they could do, that the market wanted but they could obstruct because they were seen as the safe non-controversial choice.

						<outline text="I want to know what an ICO is. I saw you write about it earlier today. The amounts of money are astounding. Are they real? Can you turn the coins you get into US dollars that you can use to hire people and buy office furniture? Or does the value only exist in a theoretical sense? Or something else entirely?" created="Fri, 01 Sep 2017 14:03:43 GMT"/>
