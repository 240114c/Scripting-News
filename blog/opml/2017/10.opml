Was it a smokescreen, or is he really that bad. Imho yes he is really that bad. Two theories: 1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Hanlon's Razor&lt;/a&gt;: Never attribute  to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence and 2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Occam's Razor&lt;/a&gt;:  If you had to guess who Trump would choose as Chief of Staff, would it be a babysitter or a fellow white supremacist? There was a lot of wishful thinking behind the idea that Kelly was effective &quot;adult supervision.&quot; Now we're finding out what we should have assumed all along. He's just as much of a Nazi as Trump is." created="Tue, 31 Oct 2017 16:40:19 GMT" type="outline" image="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/10/31/chairmanMeow.png"/>

The panelists swirled all around what I feel is the obvious new direction for news. They must take responsibility for it, must define it. Letting tech define it results in Twitter and Facebook, neither of which are good at news. Twitter is sources. Facebook is friends. Both carry news, because there's a void, but not well. We should be much further ahead. News must create a new place for people who care to get vetted news. And become more inclusive of voices and ideas from outside their circle of comfort. Create an inclusive space that doesn't have deliberately misleading stories. This means also that news orgs are going to have to get the headlines in agreement with their stories. No more excuses about clickbait. News has waited for tech to lead them. That's the big mistake." created="Sat, 28 Oct 2017 15:13:11 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/08/08/dany.png"/>
				<outline text="An important point that I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/10/27.html#a112546&quot;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; haven't made well enough is that people could stop trying to get ahead and put an emphasis on &lt;b&gt;working together&lt;/b&gt; to get us back on track. There are clear tradeoffs. I'm saying this -- take the other branch. Instead of getting ahead, work with others even if it means they get ahead not you." created="Sat, 28 Oct 2017 15:17:13 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Watched my first full World Series game of the year last night. A couple of observations, one lighthearted, and one dead serious. 1. As a Mets fan, I see a win in the Yankees loss in the previous round, esp if followed by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/11/baseballGotUglyLastNight.html&quot;&gt;Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; loss in the World Series. Almost as good as the Mets winning it all. Go Astros! 2. As an American who believes in the Constitution, I strongly believe God Bless America has no place in this game. Insisting that everyone stand and take off their hat while a soldier prays to your god, that's enough to get me to boycott baseball. It was wrong to start playing GBA after 9/11, but somewhat understandable. That was 16 years ago, come on MLB, open your doors to everyone, even people who think that religion, war and baseball don't have anything to do with each other.

				<outline text="One of the nice things about Facebook that I will miss, if it ever goes away, is a simple act of Liking a post from someone I'm thinking of fondly, who I haven't seen in a while, and want to just say hey -- I'm thinking of you. :heart:" created="Sat, 28 Oct 2017 14:04:28 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html&quot;&gt;MLK button&lt;/a&gt; is coming back. I stopped wearing it a few months ago, but it's going back on my sweaters and jackets as fall is here. It's really a good idea. It says I am the kind of American who believes in respecting everyone regardless of the usual things that divide us: race, religion, gender, age -- basically appearance. I'm giving everyone a chance to be the good human that they are in their core. I felt the need originally, about a year ago, just after the election, when walking around in shell-shocked NYC, I felt people's eyes on me, and my eyes on them, wondering if they had voted for Trump, or them wondering if I had. Now, a year later it's a different question. I don't care if you voted for Trump. I want to know if you think there were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weeklystandard.com/white-house-watch-trump-and-the-very-fine-people-who-march-with-neo-nazis/article/2009314&quot;&gt;very fine Nazis&lt;/a&gt; marching in Charlottesville. I want to know that you won't be breaking windows on the American &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht&quot;&gt;Kristallnacht&lt;/a&gt;, should it ever come, or lynching a black man, or tormenting women who work with you. These issues are all related, rooted in the same cause, and I want to root that out and destroy it, or at least make it go back into hiding. Wearing a symbol on my jacket says all this.

				<outline text="I've been trying to figure out how to put this idea in words. The world is teetering on the edge of nuclear war. The American president is provoking it. Meanwhile, most people are trying to get ahead as if everything was normal. Nazis marched in the street this summer, killed an innocent protestor, yet were defended by the same president. Very fine people, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22very+fine+people%22&amp;t=hg&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. Companies are ripping off customers, shutting down the EPA, and journalism is thinking about page views, and congress people are thinking about reelection.

					<outline text="Last night I went to a panel run by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nycmedialab.org/&quot;&gt;NYC Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;, a new thing. One of the presenters was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Stelter&quot;&gt;Brian Stelter&lt;/a&gt; of CNN. He wished he had an app that sent him email when one of his stories was on the front page, so he could do a quick review and edit. He said he didn't know who to ask.

					<outline text="If the web were developing well, from its humble beginnings in the 90s, by now a website would be a scriptable data structure that could be queried.

It says something when users think of simple features, but the system isn't flexible enough so that the answer is almost as easy as stating the question.

						<outline text="First, people focus on the connection between RSS and podcasting, but it's deep technology, most people, users and creators, aren't aware of the connection. That part of the bootstrap, writing the spec, implementing an authoring tool and adding the feature to my RSS reader,  took a couple of days at most. The hard part was figuring out how to get people to do it! It wasn't a matter of &quot;build it and they will come.&quot; It was a totally different story, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_tom.html&quot;&gt;Tom Sawyer&lt;/a&gt; and the whitewashed fence. " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 16:11:02 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Second, RSS was already well on its way when we started up podasting, and would have thrived even if it had not come about. In hindsight the killer app for RSS was the New York Times. Once we had them on board, in April 2002, with daily updates to their feeds, it built out to a news network that to this day is delivering far better results for news consumers than anything else, even Twitter or Facebook. True, most people don't get their news directly from RSS feeds. But the people who really care about news do. " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 16:13:07 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="RSS didn't need a killer app, it already had one. And RSS as a basis for podcasting, was essential to the bootstrap, but it was not the hard part. For that, we needed a bit of yeast to get the bread to rise. That came, as far as I'm concerned, from Chris Lydon, myself and then Adam Curry. At that point, we had enough examples for people to get the idea that they could do it too.  " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 16:14:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Jason's well-intentioned understanding of how podcasting came to be, and what role RSS plays in today's news ecosystem is the one many people have, but it is wrong. Every time I see it I try to correct it.

He of course talked about the famous interview with the coal miner, but left out the best part, the thing he got dinged for the most (at least of what I heard) -- not challenging the guy on his opinion that coal didn't cause climate change. I totally supported that. I wanted to hear the guy's story and have the interviewer just let him say his piece. We know the arguments. It wouldn't have added anything to the story. Also, he defines the Daily as a podcast about the reporters who report the news. And the Longform interview was a podcsat about the podcast about the reporters who report the news.

That was their basic posture re the upstarts, Google, blogs, all the things that were popping up around that time. All were apps that ran inside MSIE. A threat? Nah.

They generate their own gravity, and people who work there become focused on that, rather than the rest of the world.

I hated it. I didn't trust myself with the power. I realized I could just turn to the left and shoot someone. And they could shoot me. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

						<outline text="Yesterday, I got MySQL running on my desktop Mac through MAMP. The instructions were better than with the download from the main Oracle site. But they weren't really good. It's common in this world to leave out the bridge you need to get from installing to using. In this case, they didn't tell you there's an app in the Applications folder called MAMP.app, that it put there. They also didn't tell you that you can access a local web page to find a dashboard for the MySQL server. They also never told you there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop&quot;&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt; available at the command line called mysql and you can type SQL queries at it. I figured it had to be there, why have a command-oriented language like SQL if you can't enter it interactively? All of this info should have been in a bulleted list. These are the things you need to know to get started. 1. 2. 3. " created="Fri, 06 Oct 2017 14:09:45 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Anyway, after getting it up, and running a few commands, I quickly realized having it local will do no good, I need it on a server. I tried setting up a new server with MySQL on it, first on Amazon and then on Digital Ocean. On Amazon I went through &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?sc_channel=PS&amp;sc_campaign=pac_ps_q4&amp;sc_publisher=google&amp;sc_medium=aurora_rds_b_pac_q42017&amp;sc_content=aurora_e&amp;sc_detail=amazon%20aurora&amp;sc_category=aurora&amp;sc_segment=webp&amp;sc_matchtype=e&amp;sc_county=US&amp;sc_geo=namer&amp;sc_outcome=pac&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!224583983660!e!!g!!amazon%20aurora&amp;ef_id=WQkVoQAAANfCJBGW:20171006143058:s&quot;&gt;Amazon Aurora&lt;/a&gt;, I don't know exactly what it's supposed to be. It sounded like it was supposed to be an easy hosted way to run MySQL; it was the &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt; part that attracted me to it. This time instead of not finding the bridge, I was asked to make a lot of decisions that 1. I had no idea how to make and 2. I suspected would not make a difference for my first application. They could have made these decisions for me, with good defaults, and I probably would be using their service now. Instead after guessing at answers on the first page, offered yet another page of impossible choices. At that point I realized I was deep in a rabbit hole. I closed the tab and moved on.

						<outline text="The problem I hit on Digital Ocean that stopped me was that I couldn't figure out how to access the database from code running on my desktop. I know it's possible. The security program I ran offered me the option to do it, but it still wouldn't accept operations from my desktop. Okay so I have to run Node on the machine, and that means I have to run Dropbox, so I can update the code as I iterate. Setting that up was problematic, because I had chosen a machine size that I didn't think was up to running Dropbox. I could start over, but I had another idea." created="Fri, 06 Oct 2017 14:17:44 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I have a couple of underutilized servers. I chose the one on Digital Ocean because I had been able to install MySQL there. The server already had Node installed and Dropbox. It was ready to go. I hadn't wanted to install MySQL on an existing server for fear I would do something I couldn't undo --  but at this point I had already uninstalled it once, and was pretty confident I wouldn't break anything. So I sucked in my breath, said a prayer and installed MySQL, wrote a test app in Node, and hit another wall. My new app needed the new version of Node, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/2100&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hapijs/boom/issues/164&quot;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;i&gt;request&lt;/i&gt; package, I had seen before on another server. So I fumbled around for about an hour trying to remember how I worked around this problem last time. I ended up completely reinstalling Node and then, boom, my little MySQL app worked! It showed an error message that it couldn't find the database. Correct, I hadn't created it yet. " created="Fri, 06 Oct 2017 14:19:54 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Schieffer&quot;&gt;Bob Schieffer&lt;/a&gt; on Face The Nation. He says that the press used to be gatekeepers, but not so much these days. I still get my news from the major brands, only a few new ones have entered my zone of trust.

She was unknown just a few days ago, and has said things that normally would never get through the gatekeepers. But she had what it takes. A big enough title to make her not such a risk, and an eloquence and directness that serves as a wonderful foil to the panic, cowardice and covering-up of El Presidentè. Her anger comes through, and it seems real, which is very unusual for TV news." created="Sun, 01 Oct 2017 15:46:20 GMT"/>
