I think about him whenever I end one of my posts with two very cool emoji that work well together. A rocket :rocket: followed by a boom :boom:. This was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketboom&quot;&gt;name&lt;/a&gt; of his videoblog, a pioneering effort, it was pretty famous in the early days of YouTube. It's so cool that those are the names of two emoji and they go so well together. :rocket: :boom:" created="Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:12:52 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I try to begin each email with one of two sentiments: Thanks or sorry. Or find a way to praise the person I'm writing to. Start with something positive or show empathy. I've found, over years of experience, that people will likely stop reading after the first sentence, even if you are being nice. If you show appreciation or sincere regret up front, the chances that they'll read beyond the beginning seem to go up significantly. " created="Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:10:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A book author begins with a question, have you had a chance to read my book and write about it on your blog? Another rule kicks in here. No bad news. I could tell the truth, that I find it difficult to read printed books, esp ones with small type, because I have a disability. Not something that limits much of what I can do, but it does affect my reading ability. I had eye surgery a number of years ago and it left me with bad vision in one eye, and made it impossible for me to wear glasses, yadda yadda yadda. No one is interested in this other than me (very!) and my eye doctor (not much she can do unfortunately, other than surgery on the other eye, something I'm not willing to risk). " created="Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:11:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If I told the author all this, he would probably react negatively. Tell people I was difficult (this has actually happened) or otherwise defame me. But if I simply don't respond there are no negative consequences. So that's what I do. I don't like it. It isn't in my nature to leave people hanging. I want to give them a chance to fix the bug. An electronic copy can help. But honestly I didn't find the subject of the book so compelling, so I don't want to create the expectation that if he jumps through this hoop I will read the book. I probably won't. " created="Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:11:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And the idea that I owe anyone space on my blog is a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; turnoff for me. That isn't how it works. Once someone gets territorial about my space, that's usually the end of that. Which is why this is a blog post instead of an email. A rather long one, I might add. :rocket: :boom:" created="Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:00:53 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I had been a source for him before I started blogging, and he had reciprocated by writing nice stuff about me in some of his stories (that's how it works, btw in case you don't know). He had written a book, and sent me a blurb I should put on my blog. He didn't offer to send me a review copy.

					<outline text="I got a glimpse into how that part of the business works. I had much more respect for my blog and my readers than he did.

					<outline text="An ad guy for a major PC pub comes to visit. I was an advertiser, so this is normal. What wasn't normal is that he brought the Editor in Chief of the pub with him. I didn't know what to make of it." created="Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:26:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The editor excuses himself to go to the bathroom, then the ad guy mentions that they're planning to run editorial about my product (a good thing, and not unusual or improper for an ad guy to know this) and if I commit to a big buy, they'll add more space about my product to this upcoming issue. Now that crossed the line. He connected ad purchases with editorial coverage. There's supposed to be a wall separating editorial and advertising. He just told me that there is no wall at this publication." created="Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:26:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When the editor came back I told him what the ad guy said. He shrugged as if geez what's the problem. Yes I bought some ads, the amount we were going to buy before the meeting. But I never again read any of their editorial without thinking that it was all advertising. " created="Thu, 30 Nov 2017 14:27:58 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Long-term readers of this site know that I like Amazon S3 for storing public-facing web sites, and for object storage for web apps.

I didn't even understand what he meant. He said that GitHub does what S3 does. &lt;i&gt;Think of a respository as a bucket. &lt;/i&gt;We usually use it for storing program code and maybe some HTML and JSON, which also happens to be what we use S3 for.

It seems to work. I'm going to leave it running and come back to it after a time, to see if it's a dependable way to store and serve content. In the meantime, if you want to build something that uses this data, please do. That would be one of the reasons to use GitHub for this kind of application.

But teams like this year's Knicks, so full of naive optimism and the joy of youth, they are the reason we watch all sport. Al Pacino's character said it so well at the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. Sport, like life, is about creating together. It's the friendship, teamwork, that's why we play, that's why we live. We are a social species, not designed to go it alone. Yet the myth is of the Great Man. That's Melo. And Jackson. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi%C5%86%C4%A3is&quot;&gt;KP&lt;/a&gt; has a different ethic. He leaves room for his friends to shine.

The church is gone, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4114991,-122.106259,3a,75y,103.11h,75.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2GuEo7y3_hdPAoo7SG5wnw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656&quot;&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; is probably now part of a Google sub-campus.

					<outline text="To understand why, you need to understand something about how RSS works. Each item has an &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;identifier&lt;/a&gt; called a &lt;i&gt;guid&lt;/i&gt; that uniquely identifies it. My CMS software generates each item's guid using the time it was created. For example, if a post was created at 10:38:12AM, the guid would be &lt;i&gt;a103812.&lt;/i&gt; But when I move to a different time zone, say to Mountain Time from Eastern Time, the guid would change to &lt;i&gt;a083812.&lt;/i&gt; A different guid, therefore the RSS reader thinks it's a new post. So you see it again in Feedly. Depending on how the reader works it might see it as a new item once again when I move back to Eastern Time. " created="Mon, 13 Nov 2017 14:56:14 GMT"/>

This protection was put in to guard against the possibility that you might subscribe to two feeds from one pub, and they might run the same item in two feeds. I reasoned you don't need or want to see it a second time. There are some pubs, like the NYT, where I subscribe to a dozen or more feeds. They might run a sports/business item in both the sports and business feeds. Because they are in different feeds, the guids don't match, so you'd see it again.

That's how I write code and blog posts, docs, change notes, show notes for my podcasts, etc. Editing structures is my thing. Then, I had the idea that a website could be a document.

It's proven a good way to evolve sites I created, with real content, specs, essays, blog posts, feeds, JSON files, images, outlines, movies, podcasts, music, wire photos, all the things I have experimented with and created standards for over the years. It's a mess, but I kept good notes. If anyone wants to see my work, it's all there.

I was getting the usual talking points from several participants from different organizations, the ones I get when this is discussed on Twitter. Since we had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule&quot;&gt;Chatham House Rule&lt;/a&gt; I can't say who they are. It was fun to get the pushback I always get when I write about it, in real time, face to face. It's all bullshit, masking the ridiculous power grab by Google and Mozilla. If HTTPS is so necessary, then selling it on its own merits should work fine, without destroying the history of the web. I'm kind of okay with Google using it as a &quot;signal&quot; to determine search rank, although it's a lie and makes me think very negatively of Google. But using their dominance of browserland to &lt;i&gt;force&lt;/i&gt; this, there's no justification for that, and there should be a huge anti-trust outcry over it. If I have anything to say about it, there will. My blog may not have huge traffic, but I'll use whatever I have to expose this. They call me names, but it all amounts to one thing -- they don't want to be called out. I love the web, think it's very important, and only fascists want to destroy history.

				<outline text="Lots of gender discussions. Earnest, well-intentioned, supportive, even at times loving. But most of it too dangerous for me, as a man, to write about in public. I will say this one thing. I heard the term &quot;mansplaining&quot; used several times, by people of both genders. I don't like it. I don't think you should either. &lt;i&gt;Man&lt;/i&gt; is becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pejorative&amp;t=hg&amp;ia=definition&quot;&gt;pejorative&lt;/a&gt; just as &lt;i&gt;Jew&lt;/i&gt; was when I was growing up. I thought to be a Jew was dirty. I didn't want to be one, even though my family ran for their lives in the Holocaust, because we were Jewish. I both hated the term and myself. If the unfair effort to indict men, as a gender, continues, you're going to have a lot more angry self-hating men. If you think that's good you're crazy. You want to see how bad the term is. Imagine if the &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt; in mansplaining were replaced with &quot;jew.&quot; It's a hateful term, and if you use it, you're spreading hate. And you gotta know that's going to come back on you. No way around it. Find another way to get a person, of any gender, to listen. Without resorting to awful humiliating gender-slamming tricks.
