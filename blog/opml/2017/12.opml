				<outline text="Source of a frustrating bug. Properly use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch&quot;&gt;try/catch&lt;/a&gt; to catch all errors, even in brand-new code. Fail to report an error in one branch. Forget to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require&quot;&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/a&gt; package. But the error is inside the try, so the runtime doesn't trip an error either. Have the debugger not go into the code that has the error for some reason I won't try to determine. 1 hour later, unwind the mess. :boom:" created="Sun, 31 Dec 2017 18:28:25 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="From a thread on Facebook. &quot;Boulder is great, but Denver can't be bad, it's Just that Boulder is relatively small, easy to grasp, like one of the towns on the peninsula in the Bay Area. I also like Santa Fe and Taos. Beautiful houses, low cost. Skiing right there. And New Hampshire and the Berkshires. I like places that have legal cannabis, says something about the voters even if you don't partake. But I couldn't live in Calif again, feels soulless to me.

				<outline text="I venture to say no one has more experience with platforms than I have. Over the years I've never seen a vendor &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; try to tap into the power of independent developers. Everyone makes a first try, hit the same wall and bounce off it in predictable ways, usually giving up on getting much power from developers. So many examples. There's an art for compensating developers and choosing the ones you're going to work with. Yes you will piss people off. I imagine in Hollywood when they cast a movie the people who aren't chosen are pissed. But that doesn't stop them from making movies. There's a way to do it, and the vendor that gets it right will enjoy longevity and huge PE ratio.

					<outline text="This sounds terrible. Right? Well, it's just like Shariah Law or &quot;chain-immigration.&quot; It sounds like a technical thing, but in reality it's a problem they made up. In practice nothing really is lost. XML sometimes garbles stuff if it isn't properly encoded. The solution is to properly encode it. ;-)"/>
					<outline text="By pointing at this and saying Oooooh silent data loss. Oooh RSS is bad, people who didn't understand would think, oh I need to change to use this new thing. Or so the proponents hope."/>
					<outline text="Just like Shariah Law is not a problem in America, and chain-immigration simply means letting families come to the US (a good thing, most people would think, so why not say it that way, hah), the tech trolls were saying basically that &quot;RSS is XML,&quot; which their format was too. If everything is done right (a big assumption) you could possibly avoid &quot;data loss&quot; by using their format, or you could stick with RSS and properly encode the text. The latter approach is MUCH cheaper."/>

				<outline text="It's disgusting the way Repubs attacked NY and Calif with their tax plan. An idea for a counter-attack: tax all income over $1 million at 100 percent, and accompany it with a statement. We will restore the tax to what it was when the Repubs undo their attack. That would get a conversation going between the rich folk who own the rest of us. What would NY/Calif do with the money? Pay its citizens to move to Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, etc. And vote. It wouldn't take many expat NYers to turn those states blue. I know it's a hardship, that's why they have to be paid, well, for their sacrifice.

						<outline text="First, Roy Moore is a crazy candidate. A total looney bird. Would only be worse if he wore a Gestapo outfit while he rode his horse to the polls. His insanity would appeal to a very small group of people, normally, but Alabama is not normal. You could nominate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Dahmer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson&quot;&gt;Charles Manson&lt;/a&gt; and they'd probably get elected as a Repub in Alabama, any time except now. " created="Fri, 29 Dec 2017 16:01:16 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Trump has shown us where crazy gets us. People are tired of it. Even solid Republican voters. Exhausted, and it's only getting worse. Enough that &lt;i&gt;Roy Moore lost to a Democrat. &lt;/i&gt;Mitch McConnell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/cfe1852e997043e3b4d41c08e296e1ea&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that this was in the reddest of red states. That's a signal to every other state. Nominate a lunatic and no matter if you're Mississippi or Texas or Wyoming or Alaska, the Democrat is going to win. " created="Fri, 29 Dec 2017 16:02:05 GMT"/>
						<outline text="So... some red states will nominate moderate Repubs instead of the normal Tea Party asshole. And others will go ahead and nominate someone who's as crazy as Trump or Moore. Either way, politics won't scare us as much in the next cycle. " created="Fri, 29 Dec 2017 16:03:37 GMT"/>
						<outline text="However, that's not to say that the Repubs who are nominated, crazy or moderate, won't take their orders from the same billionaire assholes, the Kochs, Adelsons, Mercers, etc. Their form of lunacy won't go away any time soon." created="Fri, 29 Dec 2017 16:04:41 GMT"/>

					<outline text="If there is a patriarchy, no one gave me the password (or the URL for that matter). In my experience, men are pretty shitty to other men. On the other hand, women are pretty shitty to men too. I suppose it's simply that people are shitty to other people, and (possibly) gender matters only in how they express their shit? I don't think people have studied this objectively, so I think my own opinion is as good as anyone's.  " created="Thu, 28 Dec 2017 15:31:22 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/28/cylon.png"/>
					<outline text="That said, unequivocally, my best friends are women. They listen better, care more, share more of who they are, are less guarded than my men friends. The exceptions among men are people who have had their armor removed by life. Having a serious illness or divorce, some kind of crisis that woke them up. And this may be true of women as well. If you haven't had to deal with a personal existential crisis, at some level you feel like life is infinite. People who have evaded death, for the moment, tend to be better friends. " created="Thu, 28 Dec 2017 15:32:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And before you blame men for having the armor in the first place, it was our families and society that forced us to have it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc45-ptHMxo&quot;&gt;Be a man&lt;/a&gt;, man up, etc. In my experience that was a response to growing into a man's body when I was still a kid and had no idea why people were now scared of me. I was still a boy. I'm sure girls go through something similar (though opposite perhaps) when their bodies mature when they are still children. " created="Thu, 28 Dec 2017 15:32:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think our gender problems trace to the dissolution of the extended family. We are a social species, but many of us are told we have to be self-sufficient. This is impossible. But we cope with it somehow. If we could find ways to have more lifelong friendships, we'd probably be better to each other. " created="Thu, 28 Dec 2017 15:33:20 GMT"/>

Franken could have, guilty or innocent, helped establish a process for a #metoo case, at least for politicians. The process is going to be different in private corporations.

I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IonicaBizau/medium-editor-markdown&quot;&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt; that generates Markdown code. So what I push up to GitHub is Markdown, which is the only style that GH renders as HTML as far as I know. It works. Now the question is how to save the text locally between edits. Ideally it would be in Markdown, but the plug-in can't turn Markdown into HTML to initialize the editor.

So much fear from the podium. Larry Ellison and Scott McNeally said they will crush us, in different ways. Ellison more honestly. McNealy with cute metaphors. They were both full of shit. But people in the room might not have realized that. &quot;The future's not ours to see,&quot; one might have said to Larry and Scott. Even if you're worth a hundred million billion.

					<outline text="I got an invite this morning to attend a panel discussion in NYC about how to combat fake news with technology. The panelists all have excellent job titles. No one could be fired for choosing them. The solution is obvious, imho, but it requires them to change. First you have to commit to competing with Facebook and Twitter in news distribution. Which means joining feeds into one superfeed (a term I just coined for what FB/TW do), and only including news orgs that try to write accurately and informatively and respond to feedback that they got it wrong. " created="Mon, 04 Dec 2017 14:50:16 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/04/whiteHat.png"/>
					<outline text="Think of that as white hat journalism, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)&quot;&gt;term&lt;/a&gt; borrowed from tech. I proposed this at one of the first sessions at &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+newsgeist&amp;t=hf&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Newsgeist&lt;/a&gt; in November. All kinds of well-titled people there. I was asked if Breitbart would be included the superfeed. No, of course not, I said. But, there would be no single superfeed. There would be competiton, so no one has the power to exclude. &lt;i&gt;There was no discussion. &lt;/i&gt;I brought it up a couple more times at this future-of-news conference and no one was willing to discuss.

					<outline text="The news industry solution is for Facebook to give them money. I see these two approaches as diametrically opposed. Either compete, or be subservient. " created="Mon, 04 Dec 2017 14:51:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, that's why I'm pretty sure there will be no attempt to solve the problem at this panel. How could I go and support this, when they don't have the courage to change? " created="Mon, 04 Dec 2017 14:52:19 GMT"/>
