Pretty good chance that's where we're going in the USA. Let's get it out now, in the form of a book, before they've completely locked down the press, and get it out in print, so it survives after the rule of law is gone. We can do a lot at this point to help ourselves on the &quot;other side.&quot; Listen to Trump. He wants to control speech. He's probably figured out how to get there. 2017 was a year of learning for him. Now he understands what he's up against.

					<outline text="Over the weekend I saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/movies/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-review-.html&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; about the life of Hedy Lamarr. A few observations. First, as advertised, she was perfectly beautiful. The kind of beauty that makes you think, viscerally, here is the most beautiful person. And daring, outspoken, brash, brilliant, creative, loved herself, and moved in the world with confidence. She had a mind. And the world doesn't accept that a person can have two gifts. You can't be a mind &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a beauty.   " created="Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:01:23 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/29/bombshell.png">
						<outline text="Watching this movie and the heroic and tragic life she led, made me look at parallels in my own life.

						</outline>
					<outline text="Also, I finally understand her invention. You can encrypt communication by changing frequency at seemingly random times. Both the sender and the receiver know which frequency to tune to at any time, but the enemy doesn't. She thought of using something like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_roll&quot;&gt;player piano roll&lt;/a&gt; to coordinate the two. This method, which she got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/patents/US2292387&quot;&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; for, is the basis for wifi, cell phones and Bluetooth. " created="Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:06:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Her contribution was controversial at first, but in the early 90s, when she was still alive, she got credit and accolades. A somewhat happy ending, but because by that time she had had so much cosmetic surgery that her looks were ruined and she seldom went out, her son accepted the award for her. " created="Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:29:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A personal note. I grew up believing we are related. It was something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factcheck.org/2017/12/elizabeth-warrens-pocahontas-controversy/&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren's story&lt;/a&gt; about having Native American blood. Everyone said we were related, so I accepted it. Now I'm not sure. Her real name was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr&quot;&gt;Hedy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;. My grandfather's name was &quot;Rudy Kiesler&quot;. They appear to have been of the same generation, they were around the same age. My grandfather was deported from Germany around the same time she left, and emigrated to the US. She went to Hollywood. My grandfather had 12 siblings, so it was a huge family. Perhaps Kiesler was a common last name in Germany and Austria. Maybe someday we'll find out. " created="Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:10:18 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Years ago we were excited that humanity was moving on to the web. About what it meant. One of the things I liked to talk about then is how we all have the same size bodies on the web. That's still somewhat true.

					<outline text="Until now, no journalistic organization has questioned the ethics of buying fake followers. I've always felt it was unethical to inflate your follower count non-organically, but when I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/22/reportersAcceptingFreebies.html&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about it, I've mostly been alone.

					<outline text="The &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediagazer.com/180127/p3#a180127p3&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; is actually bigger than the NYT reports, and Twitter's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twittercomms/status/957316490889347072&quot;&gt;disclaimer&lt;/a&gt; that this is against their policy doesn't mention that they gifted followers to people they like, personal friends of the founders, journalists who wrote about them favorably. It was even shown that they removed publications and bloggers from the Suggested Users List when they reported on information about the company that was leaked to them from the company's board of directors.

						<outline text="I first became aware of what Twitter was doing when I was online at the same time as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anamariecox&quot;&gt;Ana Marie Cox&lt;/a&gt;, a popular blogger, as her follower count was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/03/12/whyItsTimeToBreakOutOfTwit.html#p4&quot;&gt;exploding&lt;/a&gt; minute by minute. We couldn't figure out what was going on. Thought it might be a bug in Twitter. " created="Sun, 28 Jan 2018 17:01:11 GMT"/>
						<outline text="But it was also happening on other accounts. It turned out that Twitter was promoting them to new users. But we don't really know where the followers come from. Because Twitter is a closed system, not an open web protocol, only they know. " created="Sun, 28 Jan 2018 17:17:15 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I don't think anything can or should be done about it at this late date. But people should know that if someone has a million followers that doesn't mean a million actual people chose to follow them. And don't assume that if someone with a million followers RTs you that will get you more attention than someone with a smaller follower count. " created="Sun, 28 Jan 2018 16:56:51 GMT"/>

I didn't notice it until they said so. Why didn't the Dems use the fact that there were over a million people marching in America and more in other countries? The New Yorker writer says it's because they are women, to which I say two things: 1. I doubt it. 2. If it is, why not broaden the movement to be more inclusive? Can't we just have People's Marches?

Not only is it all there, but it's not locked up inside a huge Silicon Valley company.

					<outline text="The way I proposed doing it yesterday would have resulted in just as many lost items at startup.

In other words, no improvement." created="Sun, 14 Jan 2018 15:53:09 GMT"/>

						<outline text="There are two kinds of rivers, ones associated with a list, and ones associated with a feed. The problem applies to both kinds of rivers, but is more likely to show up in the feed-based ones. " created="Sat, 13 Jan 2018 18:36:55 GMT"/>
						<outline text="When a new item comes in, it is added to the rivers of all the lists it's in, and in the river for the feed it came from. The river files are stored in files on disk. We cache them in memory. When we want to add an item to a river, we first check if it's in memory. If is, we add the item and we're done. If it's not in memory, we read it from disk, and then add the item to the river. This is where we run into trouble." created="Sat, 13 Jan 2018 18:37:30 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The trouble is that there might be two or more new items from one feed for one river. The first item gets added okay. But when we try to add the second item, since reading the file takes so long, we will find it's not in the cache, so we start a second read. We add our item, but the first item probably isn't in the copy we loaded. It would be an amazing coincidence if it was. So no matter what, we just lost one of the new items from the river. If there are N new items in the first read, we will lose N-1 of them." created="Sat, 13 Jan 2018 18:38:01 GMT"/>

						<outline text="The best solution is this -- create a queue for each river when the first read is initiated. Add its callback as the first and at that time only item in the queue. If a new read comes in while we're still reading the first one, add its callback to the queue. Once the file is read, call all the callbacks in the queue, concurrently, and delete the queue for that file." created="Sat, 13 Jan 2018 18:39:06 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I also considered doing it brute force, simply reading all the rivers at startup before doing any feed reads. But I wanted to write the code.

					<outline text="And here's the story of how we found it...   " created="Sat, 06 Jan 2018 17:15:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="On Maddow last night she had a segment on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/slate_plus/watergate.html&quot;&gt;Slow Burn podcast&lt;/a&gt;, a series from Slate that replays Watergate in real time (I think, not entirely clear). I had heard of the podcast but wasn't that interested because I lived through Watergate, and don't have fond memories of it, reliving it doesn't sound like fun. And I have podcasts that I regularly listen to that I'm falling behind on. There's a lot of good stuff out there. But Maddow said it was a must-listen, so I set out to see if I could find a link to its &quot;RSS&quot; feed, so I could add it to the rotation at &quot;podcatch.com&quot;. This is always much more work than it should be but I always in the end get the feed. " created="Sat, 06 Jan 2018 17:22:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=slow+burn+podcast+rss+feed+site%3Aslate.com&amp;t=hg&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt;. There doesn't seem to be a single page for the podcast. There is RSS metadata in some of the pages, but none of them appear to point to a feed just for this podcast. " created="Sat, 06 Jan 2018 17:23:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I did what I often do, I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/949678740317065216&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; asking if anyone else can find the feed. This is often how I get it. People like to show off, and many of the people who follow me are technically proficient. This time a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dabeard/status/949681646256652288&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; forwarded it to the show runner, and he responded, with instructions to become a member of Slate Plus, then the feed would be apparent. Well I'm not going to do that. I just wanted to try listening to it, and maybe tell people about it on my blog if I thought it was interesting. " created="Sat, 06 Jan 2018 17:02:48 GMT"/>

Any answer that involves using iTunes is total nonstarter. I wonder if people who produce podcasts know how bad iTunes rep is with users? " created="Sat, 06 Jan 2018 17:13:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://feeds.megaphone.fm/watergate&quot;&gt;xmlviewer link&lt;/a&gt; to the feed.

					<outline text="George Lakoff, Berkeley linguist, is finally behing heard, and this is good. But not widely enough imho. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GeorgeLakoff/status/948424436058791937&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; he wrote yesterday, saying that when you RT a Trump rant, even if you're calling him out, you're just helping him, so don't do it.  This is a variant of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/07/28/dontFeedDjTrump.html&quot;&gt;2016 piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote, where I explained how trolling works. Yet last night, on MSNBC, they obsessed over the idiotic tweets Trump put out in real time. Instead of focusing on some really big news that had come out. (Sarcasm follows.) Gee I wonder if that's a coincidence? :boom:" created="Wed, 03 Jan 2018 14:31:40 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/03/stayPuffMarshmallowGuy.png"/>
					<outline text="I have a new policy. If you quote-tweet Trump, I will unfollow you. I will also break one of my own rules in doing so (Don't slam the door on the way out) and will warn you once or twice. Then it's goodbye. I wish everyone would do this. Then the well-intentioned idiots who add velocity to Trump's tweets might get an idea that it costs them followers to give flow to Trump, and might stop doing it.

				<outline text="As you may know I've been searching for a show to binge, settled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Travelers&lt;/a&gt;, and I pretty much hate it, in the middle of season 2. It's taking the place of watching Law &amp; Order reruns, a show I can space out while reading on my iPad or thinking about stuff. But in my search for something to involve my mind, I stumbled across Martin Scorcese's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/amazon-details-martin-scorseses-grateful-dead-documentary-w461551&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; about the Grateful Dead. I got through the first episode, and &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; it. And it ended on such a high note. It isn't about creating a massive work to be remembered by, Jerry totally saw through that. Anything you leave behind is bullshit. Just have fun, and you're achieving life's purpose.

					<outline text="I've always thought listening to users is a virtue.

					<outline text="One of the advantages of having a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/chinesehouseholdrevisited.html#5&quot;&gt;consensus platform&lt;/a&gt; like JS is that we all do things the same way. It works just like standards. Two ways of doing something is worse than one, no matter how much better the second way is. That's another way of stating &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle&quot;&gt;Postel's Principle&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, I already have so much code written using callbacks, and my brain works in callbacks (a bigger hurdle), and I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; callbacks. The only reason to use one of the other forms of async programming is that other devs are using them to document their ideas. There goes the consensus. " created="Tue, 02 Jan 2018 16:30:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Agreement in tech is the most precious thing, and designers often &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here&quot;&gt;devalue&lt;/a&gt; it. The more agreement there is the more leverage we have, and the faster we can move. Remove consensus and we actually take steps backward, which is all too common in software. It makes it difficult to do multi-year or even multi-decade projects. (Not a dream, I have projects I've been working on for multiple decades.)" created="Tue, 02 Jan 2018 16:35:43 GMT"/>

It would make sense to replace &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; everywhere. But if I do that with search and replace, I know some things are going to break, and they're going to be hard to find. There's never going to be a good day to do that. And my brain still uses &lt;i&gt;var.&lt;/i&gt; Also I think &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; should have been called &lt;i&gt;local, &lt;/i&gt;to indicate what it does, instead of &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; which is just a H/T to Basic, as far as I can tell." created="Tue, 02 Jan 2018 16:31:32 GMT"/>
