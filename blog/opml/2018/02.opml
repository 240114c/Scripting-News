					<outline text="An email from friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wirfs-brock.com/allen/&quot;&gt;Allen Wirfs-Brock&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most interesting emails I've ever received. Seriously.  " created="Wed, 28 Feb 2018 16:42:54 GMT">
						<outline text="Dave, I saw your tweet about building a browser by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; hosting Chromium.  You know, that is exactly how Brendan Eich’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/&quot;&gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt; browser is implemented.  I highly recommend it as an alternative to Chrome." created="Wed, 28 Feb 2018 16:43:17 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Brave very much thinks of itself as an “user agent” and that the user is the ultimate authority on what the browser does.  For example, all of their ad blocking and tracking protection (they call these shields)  mechanisms are  easily user enabled or disabled globally or  on a per site basis."/>
						<outline text="I suspect it wouldn’t be hard to define “shields” that instead of simply marking http sites as “insecure”did an alert on first user input to http sites or have other various levels of protection. It’s the sort of user control that I think they would be on-board with once they fully understood the user perspective.  (On the other hand they are immersed  in the Bay Area's HTTPS-should-be-used-everywhere culture so they might not immediately get it.)" created="Wed, 28 Feb 2018 16:44:28 GMT"/>
						<outline text="In either case, their most likely immediate response would be “it's open source, do the work and submit a pull request”.  That is easier said then done, but you might want to take a look at what it would actually take." created="Wed, 28 Feb 2018 16:54:41 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Found a problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodeStorage&lt;/a&gt;. I'm using this space to work it out. " created="Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:29:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's the problem. If you go to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.blog/2018/02/21/aMorningMusicalDigression.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on Doc Searls' 1999.io blog, it adds the port the server is running on, 1999, to the URL and redirects to it. That's because nodeStorage is not running on port 80. That's a recent thing. I used to have it running on port 80, but I needed to use &quot;pagePark&quot; for other apps running on the machine, so I moved nodeStorage to port 1999. " created="Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:29:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What's going on. nodeStorage is doing something cool. Actually the URL that's generated by the CMS is &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.1999.io/users/dsearls/2018/02/22/oneMoreReasonNotToSweatTheRobotTakeover.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. When the request comes in for that address, it notices that there's a mapping from doc.blog to that sub-site, and redirects to it. It's pretty invisible, and a bit clever. I can't imagine someone else debugging this in the future and not being puzzled by it. (Hence this long comment.)" created="Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:32:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The answer. nodeStorage needs a bit more configuration. A boolean, say &lt;i&gt;flUsePortInRedirect. &lt;/i&gt;If you don't need us to add the port to the URL we redirect to, set this to false. To maintain backward compatibility, it defaults true." created="Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:33:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now I have to implement it! I haven't updated nodeStorage in six months. I kind of don't like doing it, let a sleeping dog lie, etc. But I'm in the mood today to fix things. So here goes. " created="Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:35:20 GMT"/>

				<outline text="BigCo's out of the web's driver seat" created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:15:13 GMT" type="outline" description="Let's change our thinking about what is and isn't the web. It's not defined by the software used to browse it, it's defined by a spec. When we start from there we reach a different, better conclusion imho.">
					<outline text="I've been writing a lot about &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/23/174914.html&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;, but getting them to ease up on the web is not the only option. We could change how we view Chrome and Firefox. Instead of thinking of them as web browsers, think of them as browsing a new thing that's a descendant of the web, a fork of the web but not the whole web.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Which creates a need for web browsers, i.e. ones that include parts of the pre-2018 web that Google is deprecating. If they don't budge, and my guess is they won't, this will be our only recourse. But it may not be that bad." created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:09:42 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/26/snowboarder.png"/>
					<outline text="Just putting that out there. I'm not going to create this web browser, at least not yet. I have an idea that it could be created using &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure. Ironic that the browser inside Electron is (drum roll) Chrome. What made me think of this was a documentary on Olympic snowboarding and how the racers sometimes improvise even if it means losing the competition. They interviewed leading snowboarders, and they emphatically said these are the values of the sport. I loved the way they talked about it and it struck a chord. Imho they are also the values of  web developers. " created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:29:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So perhaps we are called on to improvise. It could be the best thing ever. The web might have more than one life. We don't know. But getting the BigCo's out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M30XXrrK3lY&quot;&gt;driver's seat&lt;/a&gt;, that alone would be worth trying out just to see what it feels like. It might be like 1995? :boom:" created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:30:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another analogy. There's a concept of a pre-CBS Fender guitar. Back in the day, guitarists wanted the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Telecaster&quot;&gt;Telecasters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Stratocaster&quot;&gt;Stratocasters&lt;/a&gt;, not the new ones, made by Fender after they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://reverb.com/news/fender-and-the-cbs-takeover&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; by CBS. In this analogy, you and I are guitarists, the web is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xecretcode/status/968229861633470466&quot;&gt;Fender&lt;/a&gt;, and CBS is Google." created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:31:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;b&gt;More ideas...&lt;/b&gt;" created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 21:16:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I'd like to tackle other problems having to do with the integrity of the web. If the issue is assuring that what you're looking at is the original content, I think there must be a less heavy-handed solution than replacing the web server. Why not store a checksum in some place you can only get to if you're authentic (use your Twitter or Facebook account, for example). Then the browser gets the checksum and compares it with the checksum it computed. Of course the location that stores the checksum is accessed over HTTPS. Goodbye man-in-the-middle attacks. (Obviously I haven't vetted this, I'm not by any means a security expert.)" created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 21:13:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another idea I'd like to try is a new concept I call &lt;i&gt;retired domains.&lt;/i&gt; I don't think it should be possible to buy gawker.com, for example, and put whatever you like there. Just as sports teams retire numbers, I'd like to make it possible to retire domains. Maybe you have to pay a comparatively large amount of money to retire a domain, say $10K. But at that point the content of the site is downloaded, stored on a hardened server, and the domain is automatically renewed every year, for perpetuity. Go ahead and make it work over HTTPS. I think this is technologically and financially doable. I would definitely pay $10K to freeze certain domains. I'd sign an agreement that survives me. " created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:35:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I'm sure there are other things. Maybe the web will become an entrepreneurial space now that Chrome and Firefox are effectively withdrawing from it." created="Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:37:27 GMT"/>

						<outline text="Google is going to warn people about my site being &quot;not secure.&quot; " created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:50:16 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Something bad could happen to my pages in transit from a HTTP server to the user's web browser. " created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:49:45 GMT"/>
						<outline text="It's not hard to convert and it doesn't cost a lot." created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:50:07 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I think that covers it. I list them here to prove I've been listening and understand what they say, so hopefully someone doesn't try to explain it to me yet again." created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 18:06:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The second reason, something bad could happen -- well lots of bad things could happen. I can't afford to protect against all of them. I wonder if they ever think about the human being who is supposed to do the work? We have lives, and priorities, we must make choices about how we spend time. Maybe our websites aren't our number one priority? Even if they were, I would much rather develop new stuff than invest in protecting archives of blogs and old docs against hypothetical problems. " created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:52:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Nothing is going to happen to the pages themselves, btw -- they're worried about how people view the docs through their browser. If the web becomes so polluted with man-in-the-middle attacks, I can think of quicker workarounds. For example, I could send the reader a zipped archive of a website. That would be an easy place to add encryption. No need to transition all my sites. And if the problems never materialize, a possibility even Google must admit, we could make a new kind of web browser, that's another option. One which unlike Google's, will let you browse the full web, not just Google's limited idea of what the web is. I think this represents a good opportunity to get Google out of the way. If we get there it will be worth a try." created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 18:24:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Re the third point, it's quick and easy -- it wouldn't be for me. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a095905&quot;&gt;experimented&lt;/a&gt; for a few years with the idea that a domain could be the address of a document, or a shortened link. I have hundreds of such domains. " created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 19:50:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One more thing before I get to the point. Some of the people Google thinks are going to convert to HTTP have moved on. There's no one there to do the thing Google wants them to do. What then?" created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 18:09:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Why we must say no to Google&lt;/b&gt;" created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 18:26:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The first reason, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/23/174914.html#a174938&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;, is the most important one, by far. And the lack of thought and care on the part of Google illustrates exactly why it's so incredibly important." created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:55:24 GMT" description=" The web is like the Grand Canyon. It's a big natural thing, a resource, an inspiration, and like the canyon it deserves our protection."/>
					<outline text="The numbers they present are misleading, they talk about web traffic, not web sites. If you add up Amazon, Netflix, Wikipedia, Google, Wordpress, Facebook and a dozen more sites, I bet that's 99 percent of the traffic of the web. But that does not represent the size of the problem. Some sites get almost no traffic, yet the information they contain could be valuable to someone in the future. Does Google cite the wrong stat because they don't know how much of the web's content is served through HTTP? Or, more likely, they know and therefore understand how what they're trying to do, if they don't plan to leave anything behind, amounts to boiling the ocean. I don't see an alternative explanation." created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:11:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Before the web, I spent a decade working on three corporate-owned platforms, the Apple II, IBM PC and Macintosh. I would say all companies tried reasonably hard to bring developers forward, most of the time, and for the most part I was able to make the transition. But, in all cases, I had a company behind me. Today I'm just one person. And in no case had I spent more than three years doing the work that required transitioning, so the job was relatively small by today's standards. Even so, given the short time, and the generally good intentions of the vendors, by the time we got to the Mac, they were already using breakage as a weapon against developers they didn't like, or who were occupying market segments they wanted to own. " created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:56:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Before the web, I couldn't see a way to be an independent developer, as long as there was a platform vendor who ultimately would decide whether or not I would be allowed to continue. But the web changed all that. And it's why I can point to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/autowebdocs/autoweb10docs_119.html&quot;&gt;archive site&lt;/a&gt; for a tool I created &lt;i&gt;in 1994&lt;/i&gt; that still works. That's 24 years of compatibility. That's some kind of record in the tech world. " created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:59:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="BTW, it's not &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; accomplishment, all I had to do was assure that the files stayed where they were. The accomplishment is the social agreement not to break things that we call the World Wide Web. It's like the Grand Canyon. It's a big natural thing, a resource, an inspiration, and like the canyon it deserves our protection. " created="Fri, 23 Feb 2018 18:18:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So now Google points a gun at the web and says &quot;Do as we say or we'll tell users your site is not secure.&quot; What they're saying doesn't stand up to a basic bullshit-test.

				<outline text="Speaking of Wirecutter, how about a review of online banking systems. I use a very mediocre system, one of the biggest banks. I would happily switch, but I have no idea if any of them are better. My biggest peeve is they throw away records of transactions after six months. Why? Why shouldn't they be able to give me a year-to-year report on what I spend on various things. Isn't money one of the easiest things to improve using computers? The current system is better than it was when we paid bills with handwritten mailed checks, but it hasn't improved in ten years. That's ridiculous.

				<outline text="That said, I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/about/&quot;&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;. I buy so many things they recommend and they're all good. Next time I move I'm going to buy a new TV based on their recommendation. I also love it because a few years ago if you told the NYT that they could support journalism by making money off the things they write about that you buy they would have said &lt;i&gt;Tut tut you don't understand our ethics would not permit it.&lt;/i&gt; Now they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/business/media/new-york-times-company-buys-the-wirecutter.html&quot;&gt;own Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="This is why I can't live without Twitter, even though it's a silo. I find it's an ideation tool for me.

Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/959094615373729792&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; that expresses an idea, strongly, that I've been tiptoeing around now for far too long.
