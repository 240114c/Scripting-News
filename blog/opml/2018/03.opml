				<outline text="New &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread&quot;&gt;davefeedread&lt;/a&gt; package. Back when I was doing all my server work in Frontier, I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/03/31/xml.rss.getFeedItems.png&quot;&gt;verb&lt;/a&gt; that, given a URL, would parse a feed and return a struct. It did all the work behind a simple interface. When it came time to fix encoding in feedBase, I decided to invest in having it be that simple in Node. I have the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedRead&quot;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; running inside &quot;feedbase&quot; now. It seems to work. You're welcome to use it in your projects as well, of course. " created="Sat, 31 Mar 2018 21:44:15 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/18/travis.png"/>

Zuck pitched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev&quot;&gt;Medvedev&lt;/a&gt; and China. He says he wants regulation but has lobbyists that worked against it. Great, you embarrass him, but the net-effect is they continue to destroy the open web. Why don't we work on something that really matters that isn't about Russia or doesn't feel like Watergate. Tech makes messes when companies get dominant. Finding things Facebook is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/09/06/facebookAlreadyHasStylingAndLinks.html&quot;&gt;screwing&lt;/a&gt; up is easy.

					<outline text="Interesting timing, I just launched a new project called &quot;feedbase&quot;. It's a reincarnation of something we had in the early days of RSS, a registry of the known RSS feeds. Back then it was possible to put them all on a single website. Eventually it couldn't scale, and it fell into disuse because there were so many other discovery mechanisms." created="Thu, 29 Mar 2018 15:15:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But now things are going nice and slow. It's been five years since Google Reader shut down. And there are lots of readers, the knowledge is out there, and the utility is known. So I thought it might be a good time to try to add an important feature to RSS that was always part of the vision, dynamic subscription lists. This will allow a user to feed their subs to a variety of apps, which makes it easier to start new apps if you can quickly boot up an installed base. " created="Thu, 29 Mar 2018 15:16:00 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Re competition from Twitter and Faceboo, I think feed readers work well with social networks. I'm an avid Twitter user, esp since they upped the limit from 140 to 280. I have a pretty good synergy with it and my blog, which I have reverted back to its old format, because I no longer have to accommodate Google Reader which didn't support the full RSS spec (a fact that very few are aware of, if you never saw a feature, you don't know it's not there). I also use and value Facebook, for the classic purpose of keeping in touch with friends. I find it doesn't work well for news. " created="Thu, 29 Mar 2018 15:16:27 GMT"/>

I offered an analogy. I've been building and living in a house for 24 years. Some of the annexes are falling apart. Others have skeletal remains, and others have become porn sites because I forgot to go to City Hall and re-register the deed for that part of the property (a rule with no exceptions). Honestly, it's a mess. But the core house is fine. Lots of parties and dinners happen there, and we have great photos of them all lining the corridors. It's a huge house for one person, but I call it home. I like it. Then Google comes into the house, uninvited, and says that electricity is too dangerous. We're going to run on new kind of power in our world. I honestly never think about the electricity. What? They say you may not remember where all the wires are buried, but you must dig them up and replace them and rebuild your whole house from the ground up with the new system. Since this neighborhood doesn't support the new kind of power, Google continues, you'll have to move the whole thing, too. Hope you don't mind. Hold on a minute. Here's the thing -- I don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to do what they say. I can go on living in the house and have parties just like before and stick with the original way of powering the place. Right where it is. No need to change neighborhoods. It's just that people who use the new Google-powered system will get a big warning when they come to visit. &quot;This place is awful,&quot; the warning will say. &quot;It has terrorists.

I said I know the answer. The Knicks are his &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=atonement&quot;&gt;atonement&lt;/a&gt; for being a Yankees fan. Now what does this say about me, a lifetime Mets fan? Well, one thing -- winning isn't the most important thing. And that said, unlike the Knicks, the Mets do win once in long while. Even that amount of winning requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+atonement&amp;t=hf&amp;ia=definition&quot;&gt;atonement&lt;/a&gt;, I guess.

					<outline text="Sometimes the Academy passes on a movie that goes on to have great significance. For me, the most interesting example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/awards&quot;&gt;The Big Lebowski&lt;/a&gt;. It didn't win a single &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71st_Academy_Awards#Awards&quot;&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder what the judges must have thought of it. A silly insignificant comedy? It's weird because TBL came after &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69th_Academy_Awards#Awards&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, which was much-celebrated by the Oscars. The year Lebowski would have been up for an award, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_Love&quot;&gt;Shakespeare in Love&lt;/a&gt; won best picture, and imho the other winners were also Big Mehs. Imho there's no doubt The Big Lebowski was the Best Picture in 1999. But you don't necessarily know it in the moment. History has a role to play too.
