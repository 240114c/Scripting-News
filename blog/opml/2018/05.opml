It doesn’t seem controversial to me. Blogs are where sources write. Same reason journalists cite blogs (and tweets). The record is where it is. For example, I’ve spent the last week rebuilding XML-RPC in JavaScript. The original work was done in 1998, and the process was started with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. That post is very much part of the record. Conclusion -- as with journalism, it's a case of apples and oranges. I've never written an academic paper, and don't expect to. But if you were doing research on networking protocols, the source material for at least some of your work, would be on blogs. Which of course, makes it clear why we should be doing more to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=future-safe+archives+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=future-safe+archives+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6911j0j3&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;preserve&lt;/a&gt; the record.

				<outline text="There's a disconnect in developerland. Thinking about the cost of a change, the advocate only contemplates how much it costs for new development, not the cost to transition existing applications, or in the case of the web, websites or domains. The longer the technology has been deployed, the larger the cost, and the more widely deployed the larger the cost. HTTP, the protocol of the web, has been constant for 25 years, and is probably the most widely deployed protocol in existence. The cost to do a major transformation of HTTP is huge. Yet when we discuss it, advocates generally speak in terms of how much it would cost to put up a new website.

Or they say that the new protocol will be so much better that any sane person will want to switch right away. Or the new protocol is so compelling the installed base will swamp the base of the old klunky one. What happens is the new way is over-done and too complex and gets very slow adoption even from new applications.

					<outline text="I love the NBA because without much effort anyone can see what's going on. It's a very accessible sport. " created="Wed, 16 May 2018 14:26:22 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/05/16/alHorford.png"/>
					<outline text="And this time of year, the second-to-last round of the playoffs, is when it gets most dramatic. The teams with the most to lose are in a contest where all but one will lose. The trick is to figure out who, and why. " created="Wed, 16 May 2018 14:58:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And then there's hope. Who do you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to win? For me it's totally predictable, unless the Knicks are involved, I always root for the talented underdog. The one everyone assumes will not win. Especially if earlier I thought myself that they would not win. Right now that team is, of course, the Celtics. " created="Wed, 16 May 2018 14:27:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I like them because like the Warriors, they can win in a variety of ways, where the other two teams, the Rockets and the Cavs have basically one way to win, an isolation play with a star player who can drive to the basket and also has a good jump shot. The Rockets have two of these guys, James Harden and Chris Paul, and the Cavs have LeBron James. It's easy to defend against a team with one or two ways to win, just concentrate the defense on the strong player, and force the ball to come out through one of the others. Last night at first James looked like he might carry the Cavs, but it turns out he is human, he clearly got tired and hurt as the game went on. The shots that were going down like daggers in the first quarter were missing the mark in the third and fourth. HIs defense was porous. For the last two nights, against the Celtics, he couldn't carry the team. " created="Wed, 16 May 2018 14:28:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The Celtics on the other hand, move the ball around on offense until they find a play. This means you can't double-team anyone, everyone is a threat. You really can't defend against that. They're pretty much always going to get off a shot. And people get to rest, so they don't play exhausted as LeBron was." created="Wed, 16 May 2018 14:31:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Of course the Warriors are even better at the distributed multi-threat offense than the Celtics, but they're also worn out by so much winning. Their tiredness comes from boredom. Who cares if they win another championship. I imagine even Bay Area fans are looking for something more interesting and less predictable to watch. The players still have to show up. But they can't be even slightly hungry for a win. " created="Wed, 16 May 2018 14:32:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="On the other hand this Celtics team has everything to prove. Not only are they very young, they are playing without their two biggest stars who are injured. You have to wonder, no matter what the outcome this year, what they're going to be like next year if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving&quot;&gt;Kyrie Irving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward&quot;&gt;Gordon Hayward&lt;/a&gt; are healthy.

Main point: companies &lt;i&gt;must not&lt;/i&gt; take on the role of governments. When they do, disaster results. A thoughtful company would realize this. All the companies say they are thoughtful. Perhaps they should think a bit more and take a step back. Apple must stop trying to hijack web links. Google must live with the flaws in HTTP. Facebook must care about preserving what's good about the web (links, styles, titles, podcasts). And Medium must take steps to preserve their user's writing outside a paywall. All of them would do better, long-term, if they didn't consume what's great about the web, rather invested in making it even better at doing what it does so miraculously well." created="Fri, 11 May 2018 13:47:57 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/05/11/helloMyNameIsDave.png"/>

There is a philosophy to quilting, which I observe as an outsider. The work is done very much with the idea of creating a legacy. I have a friend, Sheila, in Seattle who is a quilter. I wanted her to have one of Eve's quilts, even though they had never met. I thought of this because she posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10216286318295172&amp;set=a.1604799764457.241313.1370027423&amp;type=3&amp;theater&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of her latest quilt on Faceboo. We hooked up in Seattle this week, talked about parents, and of course quilting. I don't know much about quilting, but I find it fascinating. Anyway, I just rolled over the archive for this blog, saving an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2018/04.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; of the writing I did in April, along with all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;other months&lt;/a&gt;.

I didn't think of it because at the time, the way the house was set up was &lt;i&gt;the most normal thing. &lt;/i&gt;I never thought that it was an archive of lives that were now over, that it was about to disappear. I mention this so if you end up being the one to close up shop on a family house, take a good video snapshot before you start taking it apart.

				<outline text="I had an idea for a Twitter coop. A group of say 100 people with roughly the same number of followers get together and pool their logins. Every user gets the right to push one message to all our collective followers once a month. So you have to be careful about what you use it for. But that way when you have really great idea that needs to get out there you have a way to do it, without begging. Of course there has to be a way to check against abuse. Perhaps it requires the approval of five of the 100 people in order to actually be sent? It's a variant of an idea that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kyleshank?lang=en&quot;&gt;Kyle Shank&lt;/a&gt; implemented a few years ago which allowed people to donate use of their accounts for a political cause.

But I went for PC development because it was something I controlled. I could do what I wanted. Make my own art.
