The question is whether or not the date part of the date-time should have hyphens. The Frontier implementation does not. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC spec&lt;/a&gt; says not. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601&quot;&gt;ISO 8601&lt;/a&gt; seems to say they must be present. The built-in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString&quot;&gt;JavaScript function&lt;/a&gt; includes the hyphens.

For now I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/3&quot;&gt;documenting the issue&lt;/a&gt;, and leaving the JavaScript implementation as it is, for now.
