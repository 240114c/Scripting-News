				<outline text="The &lt;a href=&quot;https://decentralizedweb.net/&quot;&gt;Decentralized Web Summit&lt;/a&gt; starts today in San Francisco. Of course I totally support the decentralized web. I do it from NYC. The idea of a summit for something that's decentralized is interesting. Anyway, the web &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; decentralized. No one entity controls who can post to it or what they build on it. It is in danger of being centralized, always, usually by big tech companies, but sometimes governments. But that doesn't mean the web should run away from its decentralized nature. In fact, I think the &quot;decentralized web&quot; can't be anything other than the web itself. What is the naming protocol for the DCW? That's got to be DNS, the naming system of the web. It works, it scales, isn't without problems, but then whatever anyone comes up with as a replacement will have problems too, and will have to compete with a huge installed base.

It was also timely for me, since my mother died earlier this year. It helped me better understand our relationship from her side. Perhaps. I think they idealize motherhood a bit.

The problems we deal with get bigger every generation, until at some point we will (it seems) reach a problem we can't deal with.

As I was getting off, she described the owner as &quot;left wing,&quot; and then I got it. Next year he won't be left wing, he'll be a dirty Jew and she'll be wearing a swastika pin on her lapel.

They must be scared we will kill them. My train of thought went to just how I would like to kill the Nazi woman on the elevator. It helped me deal with the emotional pain of being so helpless while I could hear my tooth being drilled and smelling the fumes coming out of my mouth, sort of a burning tooth BBQ. I have to say there is a reason I am willing to endure so much discomfort to avoid being in the dentist's chair. Why don't they just put you under, or load you up with opiates?

				<outline text="I was reviewing some &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;old podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, and came across one from 2007. I was talking about Google Toolbar and a conversation I had with Marissa Mayer. I didn't remember the controversy, but was able to piece it together from listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cnMar1B.mp3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2006/02/16.html#When:9:37:59AM&quot;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/02.html&quot;&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20050225052941/http://www.thetwowayweb.com/2005/02/22&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/02/22.html&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;. It was a really evil thing. They changed links in HTML pages in Firefox (this predates Chrome) to point to Google's sites. It came pre-installed in Firefox. This was Google eleven years ago. Obviously that attempt to hijack the web didn't work. But this time they're coming back with their own browser, and are doing it slowly. But I don't doubt for a minute the idea is to go all the way, to make the web as much Google's as Facebook's world is Facebook's (I know that sounds weird).

				<outline text="Good morning HTTP fans. I still haven't gotten the new version of Chrome here so I don't have to look at their defacement of my blog and other sites, yet. I read in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/chrome-warns-of-not-secure-sites-to-cut-web-surveillance-tampering-faq/&quot;&gt;CNET story&lt;/a&gt; (warning self-playing video) earlier in the week that Firefox isn't labeling HTTP-standard sites as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Evil%20Incarnate&quot;&gt;evil incarnate&lt;/a&gt;. Is this true? Is it something they are perhaps willing to commit to? If so, I will probably switch to Firefox. I have some other ideas, like moving off the web and providing my blog in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; app, far away from Google's ability to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;push&lt;/a&gt; me around (hah, Electron is built on Chrome, I wonder how independent it really is). Anyway, If anyone knows what Firefox's plan is, please post a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/88&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="I love the NBA, and this is by far the best part of the season which is an interesting statement, because the NBA isn't playing basketball right now. They're playing power and money. The money is huge and the power is shifting. The Lakers get LeBron because of Magic, Kobe, Shaq, Kareem, Wilt, Jerry, Phil and Pat et al. And Golden State gets Cousins because  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbnation.com/2018/7/3/17529428/demarcus-cousins-signs-warriors-nba-free-agency-reactions&quot;&gt;they can&lt;/a&gt;. So many interesting conversations to be had. I've heard it said that the East is now a backwater, but wait until a western star realizes they can play a completely different game in the East. Free agency isn't over yet for 2018. And I can't wait to see Philadelphia and Boston compete, and somehow hope the Knicks get into it, but so far, not.

I appreciate the invention of the web. It came at just the right time. I had been knocked out of the software game by Apple. The software I made threatened them, so they launched a competitor. I was looking for a platform without a platform vendor, and had no hope of ever finding one, when just the right thing showed up -- the web. You can see my excitement in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;early posts&lt;/a&gt; to DaveNet, my early weblog and email newsletter, in 1994. But where is Tim now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is attempting to corporatize the web platform? He's still talking about writing software that will fix the problem. At this point software won't do it, imho. Way too late for that.

Aren't you aware of how much we depend on the open ecosystem? And how fragile it is? Could it be they don't remember that Google loses interest in projects that we depend on and dumps them? It's one thing when they created the thing they dump, but quite another when it's something that was once a public resource that they took over. " created="Tue, 03 Jul 2018 12:15:42 GMT"/>
