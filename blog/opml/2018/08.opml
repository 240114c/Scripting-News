				<outline text="This is not the kind of thing I usually write about, but things change, and I think it's okay to change what I blog about. A couple of days ago I was walking down a car ramp into a garage, here in Manhattan, unsure of where I was going so I was looking down at my iPhone studying the map. I also had a 30-pound pack on my back which made me more top-heavy than usual. I tripped over a speed bump, at first I thought I would be able to recover, but because of the weight of the pack and the downwards slope of the driveway, I was going down. I hit on both hands, my knee, somehow my side got involved and I hit my head. My hands took the worst of it. A little blood, mostly road-rash. Three strangers came to my aid, very nice people, and I was up and dusted off in a matter of seconds, horribly embarrassed, and in pain. It wasn't until hours later that I realized that if this happened a few years from now it could have been a lot worse. For now my whole body is sore. Reminds me of how I felt after a bike accident in NYC a few years back. This was nowhere near as bad. I told a friend I feel fragile. To look at me you might think that's ridiculous. But it's true. 63 ain't 23 or even 43. And I'm sure 73 will also be different. :boom:" created="Fri, 31 Aug 2018 02:15:56 GMT" type="outline" image="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/12/stooges.gif"/>
				<outline text="I did a lot of driving in the last 48 hours, and that means I listened to lots of podcasts. And a lot of them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+mccain&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIzej80pXdAhWLUt8KHcC0BUoQ_AUIDCgD&amp;biw=1383&amp;bih=1186&quot;&gt;were&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain&quot;&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;. Surprising to me that I wanted to hear more about him, even though in life, I felt I knew all I wanted. I had mixed feelings about him. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mccain&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+mccain&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.174685j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;remember&lt;/a&gt; when he ran against Bush and first did great and then got whipped. He does do a good New Hampshire town hall. He likes to say how honest he is, but I heard him do a lot of lying, esp about the Iraq War. That's the worst. To let people call you honest, to call yourself honest, while you're lying. That's worse than just being a liar. Anyway, he was an interesting person. One thing he said in an interview in the mid-2000s is that we should repeal Roe v Wade and then have a great debate about it. I wanted the interviewer to ask him why we can't have the debate before repealing it? I can't imagine there's anything more to say that hasn't already been said a billion times. It's a morally ambiguous situation. No amount of debating will change that. Some things just are. We will never come to agreement. Accept it. Now tell me again why appealing Roe v Wade is the right thing to do? Of course he's dead now, so we'll never know. ✓" created="Thu, 30 Aug 2018 20:36:49 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/30/mockcain.png"/>
				<outline text="I also thought he was a spitballer. The kind of kid who sat in the back of the classroom and made wisecracks about the other kids and the teacher. But he never went to the board. He did a lot of shooting from the hip. Choosing Sarah Palin was a great example. A brainstorming session, do something bold, and oops a tragic mistake. He did it again when he suspended his campaign because of the financial crisis, called a big meeting in DC to brainstorm ideas. He had no ideas, couldn't even lead the meeting. Obama did. He would have been a terrible president. We might have done a few bold and disastrous things, and I'm sure the important stuff would have fallen through the cracks.

I kept it running for twelve years, hoping the NYT would get the idea, and do it for itself, or even better, let me do it for them. Earlier today I got a letter from an in-house lawyer at the Times. It's a nice letter, given that a lawyer wrote it. But after all these years of being ignored, the first response is from a lawyer? That's not only rude, it's sad. So I decided the best thing to do is turn the site off. I don't feel like paying a lawyer to represent me when I'm just doing this project because I want the NYT to do better by its readers.

That's an interesting question that never occurred to me, because they are so disjoint in time. The OPML Editor is derived from &quot;Frontier&quot;, which is an outliner among many other things. But the OPML Editor does present as an outliner. One that lives inside a very powerful scripting environment, server and object database, all integrated, and evolved over a couple of decades. It's like the cellphone on the dashboard of a 747. However at this time, the power of the scripting environment would be wasted on an outliner user, most of the additions have fallen into disuse. That said, LO2 is a clone of the outliner inside OPML Editor, which was a clone of MORE, Ready and going way back to ThinkTank which first shipped in 1983.

I want to get Frontier running more or less as-is on Linux. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22wes+felter%22&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=twitter&quot;&gt;Wes&lt;/a&gt; was an early &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wes+felter&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;UserLander&lt;/a&gt;, he got us started with Frontier as an HTTP server. He understood the product at the time in ways I didn't. What came from that? &quot;XML-RPC&quot;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;website framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software#Manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Radio UserLand&quot; and lots of other stuff. We talked about how to get the project done, and he suggested doing video demos of the things that make Frontier unique. It's a really good idea. And kind of daunting. I'm thinking about how to get started. I think the first step is to think of a project I can do in steps, that touches on most aspects of the environment. Maybe a web site for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22bull+mancuso%22&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Bull Mancuso&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://kim.smallpict.com/&quot;&gt;Kim Parker&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloatware.org/&quot;&gt;Bloatware&lt;/a&gt; (two not-so-famous fake people I use for demos and docs). It would be more interesting if it turned out to be something useful that made sense to deploy in Frontier. I wouldn't mind setting up a server on Amazon running Windows just to get the app up and running. And then getting that app running in Frontier on Linux would be the home run.

I got a fair amount of snarky pushback on this. I didn't mean that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; should run the web. I meant that the web should be run by people who are librarians. That the first questions they would ask would be questions librarians would ask. I've seen decisions made &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a123459&quot;&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt; that took no account of the web as an archival medium.

The last couple of episodes, when they wrap everything up, are really low quality. You see this happen sometimes in a great series. Everything but the writing is still great. They make up for the lack of coherence with music, to try to make the stupid shit they're doing seem dramatic, which just makes me turn away. I remember being angry that they didn't do a fourth season when the show was running. I have no such feeling now. I think they could have ended it without the last couple of episodes. Even so, it's a story for our times, in tech and politics, now one very rich and toxic person can spoil a flawed but vibrant community. Some rich people got rich by stinking up the room so thoroughly that people of integrity say &lt;i&gt;Go ahead you can have it. &lt;/i&gt;That's their business model.

However the gist of this piece remains valid.

					<outline text="Alex Jones is the first major test of this new system of speech governance. He has been banned by Facebook, YouTube, and put on a timeout by Twitter. Now the question has been raised whether Automattic, the operators of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; should be pressured to force the Jones site off their platform. A major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/business/media/sandy-hook-conspiracies-leonard-pozner.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in Monday's NY Times raises that question, and my friend Davis Shaver &lt;a href=&quot;https://davisshaver.com/2018/08/16/automattic-needs-to-rebalance-its-hate-speech-free-speech-protections-as-soon-as-possible/&quot;&gt;opines&lt;/a&gt;. But there's a problem in this analysis because Wordpress.com isn't like the others, it isn't a silo, so banning him from that service will not necessarily have any affect on the presence of his site. He will be able to export his site, set up his own server, point the DNS entry at that server, and proceed on the open web and it will appear to outside viewers as if nothing happened. This will be the end of the discussion, unless the anti-speech advocates try to exert pressure on the open web. There they will find there is no CEO, no corporate headquarters, no shareholders afraid of losing value, none of the usual pressure points. If the web maintains its integrity, Alex Jones will be able to spread his vile &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandyhookstalkers.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;hateful&lt;/a&gt; and possibly libelous &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandyhooked.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; without further accosting.

					<outline text="As I wrote in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1028630757856751616&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Johannes Ernst is smart and brave. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://upon2020.com/blog/2018/08/why-decentralized-social-networking-never-makes-it-ever-heard-of-crossing-the-chasm/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; decentralized networks never make it, and there are reasons for this. I agree, in a way, but ultimately think his theory is wrong. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+decentralized&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;decentralized&lt;/a&gt; networks have blossomed and survived, and imho will still be operating when the silos are gone.

					<outline text="Consider the case of RSS vs Twitter. When Twitter came along it grew fast, it overtook RSS. It didn't do away with RSS, because it's still here co-existing with Twitter. It still has advantages over Twitter. Richer data. Extensibility. Podcasting. Titles. Styling. Multiple links per item. No character limit. If RSS has so much going for it, why did Twitter surpass it? Not for any of the reasons Johannes cites. Imho it was because subscribing was done with a single click. That could have been done with RSS too, in fact we had it working in our own RSS network at UserLand, we called it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/macros/xmlCoffeeMug&quot;&gt;coffee mug&lt;/a&gt;. One click to subscribe. it could have become a universal one-click subscribe, if our competitors were willing to go along with UserLand's leadership, but they weren't. One  click to subscribe was an important survival trait in the Darwinian ecosystem of online social nets.

I guess he's right about trending topics, but the feature has no value for me, it's there on the Twitter screen, but I never look at it. For search, it's been proven that search works well on distributed networks. Google is a good example. There's no reason an equivalent search function couldn't be created for blogs or feeds, in fact last week I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/09/141354.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about features that would make search much better for distributed systems.

Then the power of the two open distirbuted nets would combine, there would be more interfaces, greater know-how among developers, and more choice for users. I have to dig into it. I think Johannes' theory depends on using Mastodon as the counter-example to Twitter, because while Mastodon is strong and growing, it hasn't withstood the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/30/rssOnTheDesktop15YearsLater.html&quot;&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; that RSS has.

I never want to be one of those people.  " created="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 14:16:32 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/02/frankensteinMonster.png"/>
					<outline text="But sometimes a service is very hard to opt out of, and they take advantage of that, by changing the service from tolerable to obscene. Disqus is now doing that, and it will be hard and/or painful, maybe impossible, for me to opt out." created="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 14:25:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/feedBase/#comment-4017626921&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of one of the pages. And a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/02/disqusScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 14:28:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've used Disqus for comments for many years, probably a decade, maybe more. I included their code in my pages, so users could comment on posts. I've even built support for products on Disqus. Some pages have a lot of comments with valuable information. Just turning off Disqus, a brute force way of opting out, would also remove those comments. And turning off Disqus is hard to do because I don't control the HTTP servers that host most of my content, and changing the HTML pages themselves is a sizeable task (understatement)." created="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 14:18:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="How we got here. The old Disqus was fairly innocuous. Of course they spied on the users, and then a few years ago they started including ads, but they were small and out of the way. Now the ads are huge, and getting bigger. They're more prominent than the comments. It's as if I were running ads on my sites, and the comments were clickbait to get you to look at the ads, like so many sites these days. Their ads make me look bad." created="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 14:20:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Of course I don't run ads on my pages. It's never been worth it to me. Those are their ads, paying them money, on my pages. They're changing the deal on pages that were published a long time ago, and are there just to maintain a record." created="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 14:21:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I could probably turn off the display for most of them without modifying any content, using CSS. I now wish I had a central set of styles every page included, but I wasn't so wise as to foresee the need. I have a conundrum. Every time I look at one of the pages with those huge ads on them, I think what a problem, I need to fix this, now." created="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 14:22:57 GMT"/>

					<outline text="First step in fixing it, I guess, is documenting the problem. Done." created="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 14:24:16 GMT"/>

				<outline text="When I moved to California from Madison in 1979, I put together a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf&quot;&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt;, in a manner of speaking, about the work I had been doing on an integrated outliner and database that I build into the UCSD P-System running on top of CP/M on a Cromemco machine. I called the product &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf&quot;&gt;HighFiles&lt;/a&gt;, for high level file system. That's how I thought of it. We found a copy of this document in my mom's house back in February. Finally got around to scanning it. It's a time capsule. Some ideas I didn't think I had that early, and some absolute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shaking%20my%20head&quot;&gt;SMH&lt;/a&gt; things, which I'm now putting on the record.
