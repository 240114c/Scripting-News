Here's another way to look at the same set of facts, from a piece I wrote earlier this month. &lt;/i&gt;" created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 15:20:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Our online discussions always seem to miss the 900-pound gorilla in the middle of the room. The environment we were raised in was full of abuse of all kinds, lots of it impossible to get away from, because the abuse was at home. In those situations there was no escape. " created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 15:21:41 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/30/mushRoomSoup.png"/>
					<outline text="Even if there wasn't any abuse in the house you grew up in, that you were aware of, your classmates were dealing with it, your best friends, the people you chose as lovers. Or your parents did, or their parents. It's all a fog, because we're totally not allowed to talk about it. That might the worst part, you're forced to keep the secret for the people who are hurting you. "/>
					<outline text="This was the argument I had with my parents as I was growing up, why can't we talk about this, find a solution. I learned later through therapy and inference the horror show my parents grew up in. I've talked about it with my closest friends, and they've told me the stories of their families. Once, just once, my mother volunteered what happened between her and her parents, but after that, no more. She'd never talk about it. She didn't do anything wrong, she was a child,  she carried that burden for them through her whole life."/>
					<outline text="It really is the environment. And when we start talking about it that way who knows what happens, maybe it gets better, or maybe we find we can't live with each other. Or something else, totally unpredictable. "/>

				<outline text="I wonder when the world is going to be fed up with us. Half of the US population feels like they've been screwed, and the funny thing is it's both halfs. And meanwhile we're the ones who are screwing everyone else. First we get them all going on &lt;i&gt;Let's Work Together to Solve Climate Change, &lt;/i&gt;then we pull out of the group that we formed to do it. We make peace with Iran, bring everyone else along, and then we pull out. Meanwhile our currency makes us rich, everyone has to do all their international business using dollars. But we elect representatives who threaten to deliberately crash the dollar. Why? Who the fuck knows. I doubt if they know. How would you sleep at night if you were an Asian banker knowing that you had to trust this crazy country. We complain a lot, but have no idea what we do to others. That goes 1 million times over for the richest Americans. But even those struggling to get by, this is all being done in our name. If we wanted to stop it we could, we just need the will.

					<outline text="My father was an alcoholic. He was a mean personal alcoholic. I think he learned it from his father. My mother was my father's enabler. She also was a victim of sexual abuse as a child. Her father was her abuser. She learned to be the enabler from her mother, who she hated. Her mother knew what her father was doing and was okay with it. As my mother knew what my father was doing. " created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:13:52 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/29/soup.png"/>
					<outline text="My mother had a life, became a teacher and a school psychologist and ultimately a professor. I saw my mom in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Blasey_Ford&quot;&gt;Dr Ford&lt;/a&gt;, the mother I wish had. My mother never told her story. She couldn't talk about it. Only once, in the middle of the night, she called me, and told me a tiny bit of the story. It was like a confession. Before and after she refused to talk about it. I hope she talked about it with her therapist, but I don't know if she did. I have reasons to think she didn't. " created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:14:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I learned what happened by going to therapy myself, for eight years, in my forties. My personality formed as the inverse of my parents. They were the mold, I was the product. You could infer their abuse from my issues. I learned a lot about myself. I learned that it wasn't my fault that my childhood home wasn't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet&quot;&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave it to Beaver&lt;/a&gt;. My mom often implied that it was my fault. Kids are amazing at absorbing the judgment of adults." created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:15:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I mention this as we start to discuss abuse more openly in our society. What I've wanted to say, I've ached to say, is that it's not an extraordinary event, it's the context within which we exist. We talk about abuse as if it was exceptional, but it's so much more. It's like talking about the game of chess by talking about chess pieces. Or a soup by looking at the peas, tomatoes, carrots. There's a gestalt. And that is still unmentionable. The abuse forms us. It gives us our issues. It creates problems that we have to overcome, or not. We each are assigned roles to play as children, it's hard to break out of the part you're given. To really get started healing, we have to pop up a level and look at our environment. " created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:16:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When I watched Kavanaugh this is what I saw. A person failing to maintain the pretense that he has had a wonderful life, when his life has been a horror show. He drinks to avoid looking. He is so much my father, I feel I know him, and while I loathed my father for most of my life, I eventually saw his struggle, one he never overcame, a child who was never accepted by his parents. It's no wonder he couldn't cope with being a father. Same with my mother. Again Dr Ford provided a perfect screen for me. She did what my mother never could do. My mother never got within 100 million miles of what Dr Ford did. She couldn't even talk about herself to her children, maybe not even to her therapist. She never made peace with her father and mother. And as a result never made peace with herself. She longed for love, for acceptance, for peace, she never attained it. " created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:17:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think we're on the cusp of a huge revolution in humanity. Living in a soup of abuse and having to pretend everything is perfect, that's the world we're coming from. It's the only world we've known. At least I learned to tell myself the truth. That's progress. Now maybe we can get to a place where it's common to tell each other our truth. Then evolution can take off in a huge way. " created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:24:04 GMT"/>

					<outline text="We're getting close to talking about the real stuff, as a society. We haven't gotten there yet, but the testimony of both Dr Ford and Judge Kavanaugh represent truths never spoken so publicly before. Not even on Oprah. And it happened in the United States Senate, on TV, for everyone to see, everywhere. " created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:45:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So far we've only been talking about incidents, but abuse is more than that, it's the &lt;i&gt;context&lt;/i&gt; for our civilization. It's what we never talk about, publicly, and very rarely privately.  But there it was, through both of them, not just Ford. They both spoke their truth. Ford was more direct, but Kavanaugh was just as revealing." created="Sun, 30 Sep 2018 00:45:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What he showed us is a last-ditch effort of a horror show he was trying to present as the pinnacle. He shouldn't worry about teaching at Harvard, coaching basketball or serving on the Supreme Court, he should worry about how he's going to tell the truth, not so much to us, but to himself.

I don't think it's practical to do the data gathering the website framework does as part of building a page. But there's a compromise, the idea of a default location. If I look for a template, for example, and don't find it in your database (i.e. repository), I then look in the system repo. It works.

				<outline text="I get it. News doesn't care who the news favors. You got a scoop, you run with it, let the chips fall where they may. But.. that applies to current events. Things that happen today or yesterday, or a few days ago. Remember the word &lt;i&gt;news&lt;/i&gt; comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=new&quot;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; which means something that just happened. Another requirement of news is that it be unusual. As they say, a plane landing on time might be new, but it isn't news. A plane crash, that would be news, if it happened recently. So if you report something that happened 1.5 years ago, and is as unremarkable as a plane landing on time, and it results in news being made, and your sources being gleefully ecstatic, that's not news, that's &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+cronyism&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=definition&quot;&gt;cronyism&lt;/a&gt;, and you're indicted for no longer being about news. I've had this concern about the NY Times for quite a few years, since they were instrumental in providing the false justification for the war in Iraq. Then there were Hillary's emails. Thanks for that. And the anonymous op-ed. And then the bullshit report about Rod Rosenstein saying 1.5 years ago something &lt;i&gt;we want him to say,&lt;/i&gt; like how do we dig out of this hole we're in? I don't know what to do about the NYT. I'd like to hear what they say about this. So far no reporter has asked them why they chose to run the story on Friday that's resulting in Rod Rosenstein's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1044239074851254272&quot;&gt;resignation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/09/rosenstein-resignation-would-be-disaster-for-the-rule-of-law.html&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/09/130344.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about for-the-record blogging and did a 6-minute &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/09.html#a135522&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; on why that's important, and how we haven't done much if anything to address the problem." created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:19:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One of the big concerns is where to store the pre-rendered version of your writing. At this point that pretty much means using a commercial service, something owned by a big company, which has problems of its own. For example, where Facebook can change their API overnight, it's hard to imagine Amazon doing the same with S3. Their API is their business model. For Facebook, the API is just nice-to-have. " created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:19:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="BTW, Facebook did throw out, quickly, a big part of their API, because it was an attack vector used by Russian spammers. I don't blame them. I went in with my eyes open.  " created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:51:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="That's why I think, on reflection, that GitHub, especially since it has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/04/134647.html&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Microsoft, represents a pretty good option, one of the best we have, maybe even better than S3. Why? Again, the API -- GIT -- is the product. GitHub without GIT is a vastly different product. Microsoft could evolve it, say in 10 years, to the point where GIT is as important as SMS is for Twitter, an ancient legacy, supported half-heartedly (I was never a fan of SMS in Twitter, btw). It could happen. But in this world, ten years is a long time. It shouldn't be, but it is." created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:22:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another fact in its favor is that Microsoft has an excellent reputation for continuity over the years by not deprecating past APIs, preserving software and data compatibility. I haven't been following closely in recent years, but in the 90s and through the 00s I marveled that new Microsoft OSes could still run software I shipped for MS-DOS in the early 80s. Somewhere deep in Microsoft's DNA, we hope, still lurks a reverence for how we got where are. " created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:25:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="GitHub was sure to get acquired by someone. Microsoft was probably as good as they could have done. " created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:27:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another thing about GitHub is that they, prior to the Microsoft acquisition at least, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;encouraged&lt;/a&gt; us to think of it as a backend for a website. " created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:27:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And even better, all of this is free. " created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:28:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I think it's a pretty good place to start for a future-safe for-the-record blogging back-end. " created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 16:28:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PS: I have a couple of projects I started in the last couple of years that relate to this. &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/english/&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, a wizzy editor for GitHub docs and readme's, uses GitHub's OAuth-based API. And a Node app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/githubpub&quot;&gt;GitHubPub&lt;/a&gt;, that serves via templates from GitHub repos, with custom domain names. Between the two, you could get to a very low cost Medium clone, the ideal of the for-the-record blogging concept, with hosting done for free by Microsoft. It's scary in a way how high you can build without paying a bill or even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/30/strategyTax.html&quot;&gt;strategy tax&lt;/a&gt;.

I had started to watch the first season when it first came out but gave up in boredom and confusion and lack of caring. I decided to give it another try when a friend said she loved it. I accidentally started in the middle of episode 2 of season 2 (thinking it was episode 2 of season 1). It took a while to realize my mistake, but I decided to keep going because I was interested in the characters. Something that had not happened when I started with season 1. " created="Mon, 10 Sep 2018 14:57:49 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Anyway, it's a pretty mediocre story with the same characters meeting each other over and over, trying to get somewhere with each other, that they never seem to get. But it is beautifully shot, and a bit entertaining, so I got all the way to the end.

The star of season 2 of The Wire, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sobotka&quot;&gt;Frank Sobotka&lt;/a&gt;, has a big part in this show too.

						<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Campaign on oversight&lt;/b&gt;. The reason the Dems must take back at least one chamber of Congress is then they can do oversight of the Trump Administration.

						<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Concerts/rallies&lt;/b&gt;. The Dems have completely ceded the ongoing entertainment campaign to Trump. His rallies are more like concerts, with a single comedian.

He's good but he's not that good. The Dems have the best comedians and musicians. They even have politicians who can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3eC35LoF4U&quot;&gt;burn down the house&lt;/a&gt;. Every Trump rally should be programmed against, provided for free to all the networks. Gradually push him off the air." created="Mon, 03 Sep 2018 15:44:17 GMT"/>
						<outline text="&lt;b&gt;Starve the troll&lt;/b&gt;. He gets around the media and goes direct. This of course imho is a good trend long-term because it forces the media to become part of the people and vice versa. But in the immediate term, he controls discourse, he keeps the focus on himself, exclusively. Block the troll. And unfollow people who RT him, no matter how much you value their other contributions. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/22/151134.html&quot;&gt;trolls die in darkness&lt;/a&gt;, and that's a good thing. " created="Mon, 03 Sep 2018 15:45:57 GMT"/>
