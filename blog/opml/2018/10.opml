				<outline text="The Moneyball of politics" created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:10:35 GMT" type="outline" description="Hillary didn't lose because she had bad ideas, quite the opposite. She just didn't know if she was a nurturing mother or a strict father. ">
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff&quot;&gt;George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt; was on MSNBC last night, along with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=affable&quot;&gt;affable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kristol&quot;&gt;Republican pundit&lt;/a&gt;, to talk about his ideas of how politics works. Lakoff's view is as far as I'm concerned exactly right. Republicans represent the strict father, and Democrats the nuturing mother. When you vote Republican it's probably because in the house you grew up in the father was a strong figure and the mother not. If you vote Democratic, you're seeking the mother, because that's what you trust. " created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:10:39 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/31/moneyball.png"/>
					<outline text="The Repubs know about this, and play into it, and the Dems think we make voting decisions based on policy. That isn't the observed behavior. If you ever doubted it, Trump is the proof. He says whatever he wants. People don't care. It's who he is and how confident he is that makes them feel comfortable." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:12:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Lakoff also talks about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/jul/20/the-power-of-framing-its-not-what-you-say-its-how-you-say-it&quot;&gt;framing&lt;/a&gt;. It matters how you present an idea more than what the idea actually is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act&quot;&gt;Partial birth abortion&lt;/a&gt;, for example, sounds horrible. But if you or a family member needed an abortion to save their life, you'd see it differently. Framing. Lakoff says &quot;Don't think about an elephant&quot; as Trump might say &quot;Don't kill Jews.&quot; When Trump says it, he's putting the idea of You -&gt; Killing -&gt; Jews in your head. He can say he said not to do it. But it's just as effective at planting the idea when negated." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:24:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="An example from my own life. Talking with an Apple exec at a tradeshow in the 1990s he said &quot;We're not trying to crush you,&quot; from which I concluded they are trying to crush me. It's the way the mind works. Lakoff sees that clearly, but TV pundits and Democrats don't know this. They really don't. They think facts are how people make up their minds. " created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:26:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Even though he's so brilliant, when Lakoff goes on MSNBC it's a disaster. None of his very important ideas are communicated. He says &quot;Don't think about the elephant,&quot; and leaves it to the listener to figure it out. The other panelist and perhaps the moderator have no idea what he's talking about, and unless you had read his book, or attended a lecture, or listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/02/25/interviewWithGeorgeLakoff.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, you couldn't. No discussion happens, it's a wasted opportunity. I've seen this happen twice now. Frustrating as hell. Because it's hard to explain how fucked up a system is within the system itself. " created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:13:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think these ideas are as powerful as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt; was to baseball when they were discovered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2011/11/michael-lewis-and-billy-beane-talk-moneyball.html&quot;&gt;Billy Beane&lt;/a&gt; of the Oakland As. Since then it's been practiced by football, basketball, and other baseball teams with much success. Moneyball says you should look at what factors make a difference in winning, and do that. An inexpensive hitter who reliably gets on base, even by walking, is more central to winning than an expensive high percentage hitter. You look at the numbers and do what they say to do. The As, a poor team, couldn't afford to buy the great players, so instead they bought players that made them win. :boom:" created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:29:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Lakoff is the equivalent of Moneyball, but applied to politics. Lakoff's laws are observable. Hillary didn't lose because she had bad ideas, quite the opposite, she had smart ones, based on decades of experience in government, and a genius mind. She just didn't know if she was a nurturing mother or a strict father. " created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:32:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I don't think we're going to dig out of this until the leadership and the marketing people in the Democratic Party learn about Lakoff's family and framing. A book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis&quot;&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/a&gt; would be hugely impactful." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:15:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PS: We will eventually sort it out, I think, if we survive Trump. The next generation of leaders in the Democratic Party are really something. I'm thinking of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams&quot;&gt;Stacey Abrams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gillum&quot;&gt;Andrew Gillum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beto_O%27Rourke&quot;&gt;Beto O'Rourke&lt;/a&gt;. Any combination of them could be the 2020 ticket. Or maybe something really smart from a marketing standpoint, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shannonrwatts/status/1057314813787820033&quot;&gt;Stacey Abrams&lt;/a&gt; as VP and Joe Biden at the top of the ticket.

				<outline text="Software design for older people. It's a fact as you get older your short term memory weakens. I think of something to do, get distracted for an instant, and then can't remember what I was going to do. 15 minutes later I remember. That's why even small changes to the way a piece of software work can be so disorienting. In Chrome, they changed the way the popup bookmarks menu works. Instead of popping on the right, it pops on the left. It's also much wider (probably why it pops up on the left). To people don't use Chrome a lot, or whose minds don't lose focus easily, BFD, you'll deal with it. But it's enough of a distraction that I can (just did) forget why I popped up the menu in the first place. I'd love to know why they changed the way this works. Was there any benefit for me?

				<outline text="It's been a week since we started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/96&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about discovery in blogs. We haven't discussed much, as far as I can see, that hasn't already been tried. One idea, one-click to subscribe to a blog's feed was something we did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/22/141111.html&quot;&gt;at UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. The problem wasn't technology, it wasn't hard, rather it was how to get enough of the blogging tools to support the same calls to form critical mass. It didn't happen. Here's my conclusion on the discussion so far. Two things are needed to upgrade the blogosphere. 1. A growing excited user base. 2. A (somewhat) dominant vendor who is committed to user choice, and therefore uses open clonable formats and protocols. #1 is a prerequisite for anything to happen imho. #2 is a lesson I learned when the clonability of UserLand's products was not reciprocated by our competitors. That's an important lesson and I don't think many others are aware of it. As with our tech, it's available to anyone who wants it.

				<outline text="I just ordered an iMac Pro. The only upgrade I got was doubling the memory to 64GB.

So I paid the luxury tax. The &lt;i&gt;whole thing&lt;/i&gt; is a luxury, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/22/currentMac.png&quot;&gt;current iMac&lt;/a&gt; performs pretty well. I use it as a writing machine, blogging and software, and I guess it's mostly doing I/O, it's not compute-bound. But this is the last moment for me to buy a new Mac, this is the last O/S release that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/98&quot;&gt;runs Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. There's no direct port planned as far as I know. And hopefully before this machine dies, there will be a Linux port, which is where I'd rather be spending my time. Or possibly my JavaScript codebase will be rich enough so I can port my dev tools to be independent of Frontier. Not my preferred path forward. I've been using a Mac since 1984, with a brief hiatus at the end of the 90s. The total with tax and AppleCare came to $6,497.66. It will be delivered between November 6 and 8. Just in time to either celebrate victory in the election or drown my sorrows in defeat.
