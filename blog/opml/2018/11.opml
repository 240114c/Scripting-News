For example, they could get rid of (Untitled). I didn't title the post, why do they have to make that the most important thing about it? I didn't anticipate they'd put an ad inbetween the title of the blog and the items. Wouldn't it make more aesthetic sense to not break there? And I'm not sure how they would know what order the items appear on my blog but it would be nice if they presented the items in that order instead of what appears to be chronologic order. I edit the order of posts as the day goes by. One more thing, I was expecting the email to be sent at midnight, or sometime during the night, not at 10AM Eastern. I imagine this is configurable.

				<outline text="The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos_(season_3)&quot;&gt;Narcos season&lt;/a&gt; set in Mexico is terrible. Everything about it is awful. I kept watching because I wanted to understand how they could make something so bad. I think what they did is write down the arc of the various threads in the previous two seasons, and they just repeated the story with different characters. They have these idiotic conversations about characters you know nothing about and don't care about. Even the star, the new Pablo Escobar is a flat character. His old fat sidekick is terrible. I understood him in the first few scenes he appeared in, but then he became this crazy guy. The beauty of Narcos in previous seasons is that you could get into the head of Pablo Escobar and it made sense. You felt for him and each of the people around him, even though he was a monster. In the end of Season 3 there is one scene where the two main characters meet each other for the first and last time. That one scene was good. There was some truth in it. But otherwise it was a big fucking meh. So what. Even their stories about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maximumyield.com/definition/4378/sensimilla&quot;&gt;sensimilla&lt;/a&gt; works were wrong. Couldn't they read the Wikipedia page and do a little fact checking? It's actually interesting science.

The 6S has one the XS does not. I guess it's less of an issue to me now because in 2018 it seems Bluetooth works reliably. Previous iPhones, headphones and speakers would lose their pairing regularly. This got super annoying when I'm out riding my bike, it means stopping and fiddling around with the phone while I really want to be moving. Eventually I gave up on Bluetooth for that application and went to a hard wire connection. The speakers all still have the headphone jack. Now I guess I'm entering a new frontier. But I still have my iPhone 6S in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/26/junkDrawer.png&quot;&gt;right top drawer&lt;/a&gt; of my desk along with all the other obsolete hardware I couldn't manage to actually throw away.

People want this from their blogs (Dries &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dries/status/1065592741458075650&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; this yesterday) and everyone with a podcast wants to know who listened. The thing is to make it easy for people to share that bit of info, rather than extracting it without permission. It's the web way of doing tracking. I love this. Now if NPM would just &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1066024770762928129&quot;&gt;get out&lt;/a&gt; of the way. :boom:" created="Fri, 23 Nov 2018 17:24:49 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/23/greatVaVaVoom.png"/>

I kept watching because I wanted to know what happens, and I didn't want to find out by reading about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=steven+avery+brendan+dassey&amp;t=h_&amp;iar=news&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;on the net&lt;/a&gt;. It's very depressing, even more so than season 1. And complicated. After a while I started tuning out the complications, figuring they were telling the truth and that if it became significant, they would explain it all again. And the tedious interviews with the parents of the two prisoners. I thought maybe one of them would die? Spoiler: Not much happened. The best part was Avery's new attorney, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Kathleen+Zellner&amp;t=h_&amp;iar=news&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;Kathleen Zellner&lt;/a&gt;. I find her very interesting, smart, and if they did a show just about her I'd probably watch.

I hear about the new Coen Brothers movie, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Buster_Scruggs&quot;&gt;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80200267&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, and it's getting good reviews from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/movies/the-ballad-of-buster-scruggs-review.html&quot;&gt;AO Scott&lt;/a&gt; and a friend who knows me well. So I sit down to watch. It's weird, episodic, but a movie not a series. I had heard the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers&quot;&gt;Coens&lt;/a&gt; were working on a series. The first segment was funny, I actually lol'd a few times. The second was okay, but the third sent me in a tailspin of depression. Oh no this is not what I had in mind. I was hoping for Fargo or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski&quot;&gt;Lebowski&lt;/a&gt;, but this makes No Country look like a fun dramedy. A few hours later I picked it up again, and it got better, way better. The segments were very Coen-ish, both funny and tragic. You know. Like the end of even the funniest Coen-y movies. I say go ahead and watch it, but if it's bumming you out, realize that's not all it's doing.

But if they did, they should report on the lies as lies, not misrepresentations or whatever &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word&quot;&gt;weasel words&lt;/a&gt; they use to describe the lies. And I especially don't care if CNN is there. I blame them for the Trump presidency. Journalism has to be done consciously. What Trump was doing in the years leading up to the 2016 election was terrorism. Race hate. Stuff that when/if we get past this will be illegal. It certainly was unethical for CNN to give Trump such coverage. Now the chickens have home to roost. You reap what you sow. Maybe if they're forced to sit outside of these supposed press conferences they'll reflect on what's really happening, and their role in it. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa&quot;&gt;mea culpa&lt;/a&gt; going back to the beginning of Political Trump would help get me to listen to their side. But no such admission has come. Bottom line: I don't see what they do as journalism.

				<outline text="With all possible humility, I wish pieces like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/07/142734.html&quot;&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; I wrote yesterday about the election got more attention. 20 years ago (arrgh) I had a column in Wired that worked wonders. I think part of the reason blogging took off the way it did is because they gave me space to write about it every week. I've asked many people if they know any editors at major political pubs who might give me a column like that. For example, yesterday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/07/142734.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; that's highly contrarian but also I think more accurate than the account of the election that journalism put together. That will all soon be cemented as conventional wisdom. The time to get an idea in the mix is now past. My blog doesn't have enough pull to get into the conversation. Sadly, journalists only listen to other journalists, it seems. We're already three news cycles past the election, first there was the Sessions firing, Jim Acosta being outsted by the White House and the shooting in Southern California.

						<outline text="A lot of people who voted for Trump in 2016 voted for a Democrat this year to represent them in the House. The entire House was up for election, so the results indicate the choice of all of America. Only 34 Senate seats were contested, and the nature of the Senate, where tiny North Dakota gets as much representation as California or New York, doesn't tell you so much about the collective mind of the people. And in the Senate the Dems were on the defense, Repubs on offense. What we can see from the results of this election is that if the mood of the electorate is constant, the Repubs will have a much harder time retaining control in 2020. And Trump, if he chooses to run again, will have a much harder time winning in 2020 than he did in 2016.

						<outline text="Journalists are reporting that Congress is divided now like the rest of the country. That's such bullshit. As if the government was designed to be controlled by one party with the Congress subservient to the executive branch. What they call &quot;division&quot; is actually democracy. We all get a voice in governing. In 2017 and 2018, the majority of the electorate was shut out of governing. We had no say. As a result the Repubs have run wild with corruption and really stupid decisions (heard of climate change, the Repubs don't believe in it, for example). Now we return to the normal process of governing, where one faction doesn't control the whole thing, and if we want to move, we have to compromise. Yes, that's been rare in the last decade, but a logjam is preferable to one party running rampant. " created="Wed, 07 Nov 2018 14:30:57 GMT"/>

						<outline text="Oversight. I heard a reporter on NPR say that now there will be &quot;more oversight.&quot; I suppose technically that's true, but it doesn't really capture the essence. We're going from zero oversight to hopefully intelligent oversight. Imagine the Mafia taking over the government and the police and you have an idea of what the last two years have been like. Now we have a way of looking into the crimes of the Trumps, maybe because they know they'll be exposed they'll be a little less bold? Either way we'll get some ability to see behind the bullshit now.

Anyway, the monitor has, until now, been an old Apple screen from 2006 or so. I had bought it to go with my old Mac Pro. That old monitor can't plug into my new iMac Pro. So then I thought, let's buy a new one. Of course monitors have gotten a lot better and cheaper since 2006. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IZBIMLK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;new one&lt;/a&gt; is going to be glorious, or so I think. Should arrive later today via Amazon.

They don't charge to run your application, but if it isn't accessed frequently they put it to sleep, and wake it up next time it's accessed. Just for fun I tried installing River5. It works! And even better, here we are six months later, and the app is still running, and doing a great job of getting the news. I would have thoughth it would have to do a scan for new news when I accessed it, but it's been reading news all night. There must be other people using it? Not sure. But it's good. :rocket:" created="Thu, 01 Nov 2018 14:45:08 GMT" type="outline"/>
