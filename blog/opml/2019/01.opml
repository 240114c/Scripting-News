They get their name on the program, and presumably a booth in the hallway. Probably a session or two focused on their role in the future-of-news ecosystem. And they have a more insidious effect, their presence makes sure that speakers don't criticize them too much, because they're all hoping to get some of the money they've earmarked to support struggling news orgs. I am also the only non-professional speaker, the only blogger, the only user of news. My experience with these conferences is awful. People are polite enough when I speak, but nothing comes of it.

I had recently had my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_event&quot;&gt;liquidity event&lt;/a&gt;, so of course we were talking about money, and he volunteered that it was impossible to live for less than $20 million a year. I looked at him for a sign of irony or other form of humor but he appeared serious. I asked if he was serious, and he repeated the claim. I said, pointing to everyone at the table, &quot;Every one of these people is spending less than $20 million a year.&quot; He was not impressed. I pointed to the waiters and said they're not spending $20 million a year. Nothing could dislodge his belief. To this day I wonder if it was some form of performance art or is it possible that so much money could make someone so detached from normal people that they actually believe something like that.

Since each act of journalism is just an amalgram of source quotes, we would try to draw the most authoritative sources into our network.

The lesson we keep learning is that you can't always tell what happened considering only one or two points of view. This is the mistake journalism keeps making, assuming there's a Democrat and Republican view and nothing else. They miss a lot of other points of view that matter, such as the view of their readers/viewers. We're not in DC, and we're not running for president, and we're not going to win or lose, but we still need info. Isn't that why you all do the news?? In the Wilbur Ross story they omitted important information. They wanted to make Ross look bad, but actually he was making a good point. Maybe run a piece for the furloughed employees listing their options, which I'm learning (through my tweet below, not through the news) are developing.

					<outline text="I hate paywalls. I pay to get through two of them, the NY Times and the Washington Post. If I were going to pay for others, I would certainly add New York Magazine, primarily for one columnist, Jonathan Chait, who writes a large number of (imho) must-read columns. Like the one he wrote today about the Republican way of hostage-taking, and how you just can't give into it. I remember very well how, during the Obama Administration, Mitch McConnell threatened to crash the economy if they didn't get unilateral concessions. Obama caved once, but the second time they tried it, he learned -- and gave absolutely no ground. That stopped the hostage-taking. But now they're at it again.    " created="Wed, 23 Jan 2019 19:42:41 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/23/drink.png"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I would like everyone to read that column but it's behind a paywall, so I'm reluctant to push the link. But this made me think of a slight variation on the paywall idea. How about this -- I read the Chait piece, and I think it's so important that I want everyone to read it. So I pledge $5 toward a specified buyout price, say $10K. It would be clearly stated, and you'd see how much further they have to go. If they never reach buyout, you pay nothing. But if it does, they take your money and the paywall comes down, for this article. Everyone can read it for free. Next time he writes a column, it gets a new countdown and perhaps a new price.

I was unhappy when they didn't let people who are anti-abortion speak (I am pro-choice btw).

						<outline text="When I heard about the commercial my first reaction was why are they doing this. If their products mostly sell to men this will hurt them in sales. It's hard for men (and women too) to defend the gender without invoking the ire of others, so mostly people stay silent and let the myth that men are responsible for the problems in our society go unchallenged. But you can push back via private acts, like choosing another brand, or voting. In private contexts you can be very vocal without fear of retribution. So even if you don't hear the pushback, it could come at the cash register.  " created="Wed, 16 Jan 2019 15:49:49 GMT"/>

Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/10.html#a175302&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; how that could be great for journalism, now I want to talk about the flip side, how it's great for the software journalists use, i.e. publishing software. In my experience the best software is that which is designed by people who use the product. They bump against the limits as users do, think of shortcuts and simplifications (called factoring in software). If you don't use the software your ideas about how it should work are theoretical. The closer you are to the user experience, the better you understand the tradeoffs from the user's perspective. And that ultimately is the most important one. So applied to this dual-major concept when the students learn their comp sci, it can be in the context of how journalists use computer systems. And with better understanding of users on the part of the students, after all they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; users, the better the publishing software can be.

The two groups wanted to do very different things. Netscape, as far as I'm concerned, wanted to bootstrap syndication of web content, and that was validated by the enormous popularity of RSS for that application. They had a vision that was right. And yes, they did one day just disappear. I wanted to preserve the progress we had made and build on it. I loved the idea since feeds provided exactly the level playing field I wanted for bloggers and pros. Look at all the good that came from that. Ask TechCrunch or Daring Fireball, Daily Kos or Talking Points Memo. And podcasting. These things all got their start because there was that level playing field. That vision was what was driving me. Ultimately the two forks went their separate ways, as they should have, because we were going different places.

Examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hillary%27s+emails&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's emails&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=facebook%27s+api+scandals&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Facebook's API&lt;/a&gt;. They sound like scandals when the NYT writes about them, but what are the actual facts. Believe it or not, they don't say. The business and political press will do what they do, write shallow and inflammatory versions of the story that cast the Hillary and Zuck (and of course others) in the worst possible light. But some of us want facts. At the beginning, so we know if there's anything to the allegations or are they just smears. There are millions of people today who understand what a mail server is, to them it's not a mystery. There should be some news that's written for people with that basic knowledge. The students in this program will be learning how to communicate about technology with a sense that the answers are knowable, and not mysterious. So there should be an immediate benefit to all of us, not just the students, from these programs.
