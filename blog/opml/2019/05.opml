Because it was a real contest. Playoff basketball is like nothing else. You can go to a regular season game if you want, but it's like spring training. The problem with the Warriors is that they, like other dominant teams before them, forced the league to form around them. For example the Rockets, an excellent team, can't get by Golden State, so they'll rip up the team this summer and start over. Possibly the only player who's untouchable is James Hardin. When KD went to the Golden State that's when the NBA turned a bad corner imho at least for this fan who just likes a real game, not a rout, at the very end of the season. We got that last night. Looking forward to the rest of the playoffs. I don't really care who wins btw, I just love great basketball. " created="Fri, 31 May 2019 15:46:51 GMT" type="outline"/>

There's no reason for the Wikipedia page to carry this mistake forward. All the reporters echo the mistake.

I know people rave about Barry, but like the second season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve&quot;&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/a&gt;, it is a letdown. It's funny that's for sure because Bill Hader is an amazing comedian, like a Jim Carrey or Robin Williams. It's easy to watch, it kills a few hours, but won't give you a lot to think about. It's like popcorn. I think both shows were hurt by running while Game of Thrones was finishing up, btw. It kind of sucked all the air out of the room. Amazingly, now I have absolutely no interest in reading about GoT, where just a week ago, that's pretty much all I wanted to read about. " created="Mon, 27 May 2019 19:18:41 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I was intrigued by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jack_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Gentleman Jack&lt;/a&gt; through the first few episodes. The principal character, Anne Lister, played by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suranne_Jones&quot;&gt;Suranne Jones&lt;/a&gt;, is very appealing and has an unusual problem, which she sets out to solve, all while leading her remarkable life. I'm not being sarcastic. I was drawn to it because I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Foster_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Doctor Foster&lt;/a&gt; which also starred Jones, and it was riveting, and kept my attention through two seasons. But the potential of Gentleman Jack never seems to come together and the show drags and repeats, for what? She's brilliant, but we see before she does that what's she's chasing is unattainable. Or so it seems, the season is only half-done. But the elements of a great show are there so hopefully it's turn around.

				<outline text="A friend asked me now that it's over what do I think of Game of Thrones. She hasn't watched the show, but knows that I did. I don't have a ready answer. Here's an analogy. What do I think of San Francisco?

There are some things that are incredible about it, the weather down the peninsula is about as perfect as weather can be about eight months a year. Food is excellent. Lots of smart people. I had a lot of very positive experiences there. But the traffic is awful and you always have to be prepared for an earthquake, and I've lived through one, and didn't like it. People are obsessed with money, I find that dull, which is probably the main reason I left. I've been watching GoT for a long time. It's impossible to say what I think of it. It's a thing. It's like asking me what I think of a close relative, perhaps one who just died. " created="Wed, 22 May 2019 13:03:51 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/22/khaleesi.png"/>
				<outline text="Now I think the best season finale ever was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;. The show wasn't pretentious, in fact its point was to make mundane the most dramatic thing that happens to each of us. So the ending was an ending and nothing more. I'm not going to spoil it here. I think there needs to be a site where you can keep your watching history and you can write things like this with enough metadata so it knows not to show it to you if you haven't seen the finale of the show I'm writing about. Maybe in Internet 4.0. " created="Wed, 22 May 2019 13:17:11 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="The only show that I can think of that didn't punt on the ending was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men&quot;&gt;Mad Men&lt;/a&gt;. The end was a surprise, but someone I knew had guessed it. It was clever and satisfying. The Sopranos ending was almost a pure punt (we did find out the ending for a few characters in the last episode). Unlike a lot of people -- I liked the ending. I also liked the ending of Lost. Someday someone will do a show (like Seinfeld duh) that disclaims up front to be about nothing, therefore the finale, by definition will be nothing. I guess that was also Newhart. I didn't watch either of them. " created="Wed, 22 May 2019 13:19:30 GMT" type="outline"/>

Another thing I've noticed is that people who come along and build off your open work expect you to step aside when they want to take over. This is a big disconnect, I create the software because I want to build on it, not to create a lifestyle for you, though I don't mind if you do that, that's why I made it open.

				<outline text="In 1985, Apple did something bold and brave with the Mac, they included &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleTalk#AppleTalk&quot;&gt;networking&lt;/a&gt; with every Mac they made. This meant that if the APIs were easy for developers to adopt, to build on, the Mac would have gotten a huge wave of Mac-only networking software. There's no doubt that in my mind that the web would have booted up on the Mac, possibly years before it did on the NeXT platform. But the Apple networking APIs were impenetrable, so only a few developers, who probably secretly got help from Apple, or who were especially good at reverse-engineering APIs, managed to break through. Too bad, because when the web finally came along in the early 90s it didn't have a GUI, it wasn't WYSIWYG, and since this was the basis of Mac software, it's why Apple was slow to adapt to the web, even if their developers, now liberated from Apple's lock-in, rushed to adapt and led the early web. Apple definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing&quot;&gt;benefited&lt;/a&gt; from their decision to build-in networking, but they could have hosted the web, and we all would have gotten the benefit of the Mac user interface. The web would be very different, and imho much better. This should be a lesson for Facebook. If they bend down to be &lt;i&gt;part of the web&lt;/i&gt; instead of casting the web aside, long-term they'll own a huge share of the growth that comes from lots of independent developers working alongside them.

Not cheap. But I've used it almost every day since then. Listening to the radio in the morning is part of my daily ritual. I love that I've had it so long. But of course there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075313J1R/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1&quot;&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; that has all the features I want. The best one is simply that it supports Bluetooth and that means anything I can play on my iPhone that's always in my pocket I can play on the kitchen radio. It means however that I'll have to replace the radio I love so much. Oh well. " created="Sun, 05 May 2019 15:31:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is a lot like replacing the 10-year-old Sony screen that I have with a new 4K screen. The quality is better, for sure, but the biggest reason to buy the newest version are all the new standards they support. Without that it remains an island, it can't connect to the other devices. In the last decade connectivity has gone from a promise to reality. " created="Sun, 05 May 2019 15:41:01 GMT"/>

				<outline text="A longtime blogging friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danconover.com/&quot;&gt;Dan Conover&lt;/a&gt; is writing on Facebook these days, which is a shame, because his best pieces get me thinking enough that I want to write my own post that expands on his thinking, like the one he wrote the other day about splitting the US in two. Dan lives in South Carolina. Former journalist. I met him on my visit to Spartanberg in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/02/15.html&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a great auto tour through the south. I learned a lot at every stop. So Dan wrote that the problems of the US are much bigger than a terrible choice for president in 2016, it has to do with the compromise that was made at the beginning of the country when it was just 3 million people (today's population of Oklahoma) because they built a country around two very different economies and cultures -- agrarian and urban. It's only grown more pronounced in 2019. We just can't live together. The US needs a Brexit. Of course we aren't going to get one (it's impossible). I wish you could read his whole piece.
