The book is such a drag, it goes through every project Moses did over thirty years of re-making New York. He was as corrupt as they come. He started out brilliant, with an idea, and was driven to do it almost in an a Jobsian way (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ny.curbed.com/2017/6/21/15838436/robert-moses-jones-beach-history-new-york-city&quot;&gt;Jones Beach&lt;/a&gt; was his Mac).

					<outline text="To him cars were an adventure, a way to go from the city to the country to enjoy nature. But he somehow missed that between the 20s and the 50s cars had changed, had become drudgery. Anything but fun." created="Sun, 30 Jun 2019 16:40:05 GMT" collapse="true">
						<outline text="Fun fact. Even though Moses built only around the car, to the detriment of mass transit, he himself could not drive. He was always chaufeurred in limosines. As if Steve Jobs never used a Mac. " created="Sun, 30 Jun 2019 16:43:41 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Long Island, which more than any other area designed by Moses, was a livability horror. You had to drive everywhere. All the money that could have been spent on efficient mass transit was spent on making roads and bridges that were jammed the day they opened. Classic example the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_495_(New_York)&quot;&gt;Long Island Expressway&lt;/a&gt;. It's often bumper to bumper at 2 in the morning. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruckner_Interchange&quot;&gt;Bruckner Interchange&lt;/a&gt; in the Bronx. Once I calculated that I spent three whole months of my life there, stuck in gridlock on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Union+St+%26+32nd+Ave,+Queens,+NY+11354/W+Farms+Square+Plaza,+The+Bronx,+NY+10460/@40.8058515,-73.8866668,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2601c5b98533d:0x93bbc40a40f8ae74!2m2!1d-73.8266883!2d40.7689568!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f48cf9f76715:0xeb931b7aca2177eb!2m2!1d-73.880808!2d40.8414408!3e3&quot;&gt;Q44&lt;/a&gt; bus." created="Sun, 30 Jun 2019 16:40:35 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Anyway, the book gets good when journalists take on Moses after decades of puff pieces. Someone should write an abridged version of that book, with a chapter up front saying what a miserly asshole Moses was. Then really dive into the story with the parking lot at Tavern on the Green aka the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/master-builder-robert-moses-lost-grip-new-york-city-article-1.813426&quot;&gt;Battle of Central Park&lt;/a&gt;. I'd guess about 200 pages max. And it could be turned into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men_(film)&quot;&gt;ATPM&lt;/a&gt;-like HBO series.

						<outline text="I never recommend waiting, and I also place a strong emphasis on moving forward with compatibility. A River5 installation can be converted to River6 quickly. It's just a matter of setting up MySQL, and then copying the &lt;i&gt;lists&lt;/i&gt; folder from the river5 folder to the river6 folder. Then there's a variable amount of waiting for the river to fill up, but that's something the software does on its own. " created="Sat, 29 Jun 2019 15:45:18 GMT"/>
						<outline text="All the changes are visible in the front end in &lt;a href=&quot;http://river6.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;river6.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; and &quot;podcatch.com&quot;, both of which use the new river browser. However it could just as easily be displaying rivers produced by River5. As far as I know there are no changes to that format between 5 and 6 (any that are present are bugs)." created="Sat, 29 Jun 2019 15:46:16 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I have several rivers that are mirrored to Twitter feeds, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbariver.com/&quot;&gt;nbariver.com&lt;/a&gt; is mirrored to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nbariver&quot;&gt;@nbariver&lt;/a&gt;, using a Node-based utility that I wrote called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/riverToTweets&quot;&gt;riverToTweets&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="I watched the first fifteen minutes of the debate. I thought Warren's opening answer was very good. She's learned how to bring the listener into her story. Too many politicians don't find a way to get people to think about themselves. That's key. Because people are always thinking about themselves. Once you get them to feel you're over there on their side, your ideas start clicking with them. They'll think you think like they do. They start to like you. And they start to listen. That's everything. I have to say that was the first time I could say that about Warren. Clearly she wants to win, that's also a big deal.

Ideally, if there were infinite time, there would be a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; with Trump as president doing and saying the things Trump does and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/24/fucket.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. The actor would be distinguished, presidential, have gravitas, might be black, and possibly a woman, but he or she would say the things Trump says. It would be dramatic not comedic. But there isn't infinite time. Something like the Serial podcast would be ideal. It could start simply, and expand out into all the depravity that's in the Mueller Report. It would need great writers, actors and production. But it could be done reasonably quickly. I'm going to write up a very superficial and novice plan for that, because I have none of the skills needed to make it, but think it's desperately needed.

Hat's off to him. Most great men when looking back on their careers tend to be less specific in their regrets. But imho he's thinking too small. I think his biggest failure was to miss that at the point Windows became the default platform, the role of Microsoft fundamentally changed, and he fought that and that crippled his company and the market. He couldn't make Android at Microsoft any more than GM could make a Tesla. So imho his biggest mistake was not buying a big stake in Google when they were in the garage. And anything else that looked promising. Also it wouldn't surprise me if he read this. One of his strengths as a leader in the PC business was that he engaged with criticism, and learned from it. Most people in his position failed at that, and that's why he won so big, imho." created="Sun, 23 Jun 2019 16:14:58 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/23/android.png"/>

				<outline text="Tomorrow is the NBA Draft and the deals are flying. It should be amazing. After yet another Knickless playoff season, it's interesting to see them back in the conversation somewhat. There were a lot of stupid dreams about the Knicks buying a contending team with their cap space. That's off the table because even Kawhi couldn't turn this team into a contender. The Knicks are in a rebuild, have been for many seasons, and no amount of dealing is going to make them a contender. Even the 76ers and Celtics who played it smart aren't contending yet. But at least they give their fans something to root for. The Celtics should be glad to be rid of Kyrie. Last year's team was much more interesting. Re-sign Horford and trade &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward&quot;&gt;Hayward&lt;/a&gt; for draft picks. The most intriguing idea I heard for the Knicks is to pick up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-chris-paul-kevin-durant-dennis-smith-jr-20190618-bwla5ckvffe5zehjyrmse3iqfq-story.html&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt; on waivers (haha not going to happen) or take on his awful 3-year deal, and get them to throw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Capela&quot;&gt;Capela&lt;/a&gt;, say.

Nixon, Kent State, Watergate, Vietnam, spiraling stagflation, the hostage crisis, OPEC, it goes on and on. It's conceivable that the pundit doesn't know that the world was totally crazy when he was growing up. Lehane concludes, wisely, what conservatives want is to be children again.

You take one player out and replace with another who is better at defense because what you need right now is a better chance of stopping the other team. It comes at a cost.

You put in the best defensive squad and they score more points than your offensive-strong team would. Go figure. But you have to be prepared for whatever comes your way and let it guide your thinking.

Make new laws that make lock-in illegal for dominant tech platforms. We've learned this over and over. Tech stagnates while platforms dominate, then there's an explosive new platform, the incumbent tries to kill it, and that slows things down again. Tech has an undeserved reputation for moving quickly. Actually it tears itself apart frequently, the periods where progress can be made are too short, and always comes with backward motion. Other technologies don't this. You can create a treatment for one disease without starting an epidemic of another. You can add air conditioning to bowling alleys without coming up with new rules to the game.

					<outline text="I've been emailing with longtime friend and open web advocate &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jonudell.net/&quot;&gt;Jon Udell&lt;/a&gt; about my campaign to convince &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; to post her position papers on the open web. Of all the presidential candidates Warren is, imho, the one who would most likely support the open web, and getting her campaign on board would help raise the issue for other American political leaders. I admit I am using the political campaign of 2020 to try to make the survival of the open web a more visible issue. I think it's important.

						<outline text="&lt;i&gt;I agree Warren should be on the open web. Now I'm trying to sort out exactly what I think that means nowadays, given the option to use one or another service behind your own domain name. If the campaign asked my advice, what would it be? That's what I'm asking myself. What would yours be? You've said what not to do. But what should they do?&lt;/i&gt;" created="Sun, 09 Jun 2019 14:37:10 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="So here is the basic criteria: Her position papers should survive the failure of a single company. Currently, Warren's presence, and the presence of many other political leaders, is dependent on the survival of Medium. That's the most important point of failure. It's one thing if we lose Warren's writing, that would be bad enough, but the idea of losing all the political writing, that's an unacceptable risk. It's bad tech, and bad politics, which are increasingly becoming the same thing. And for elected officials it might be illegal. In any case it's exactly what got the Clinton campaign in so much trouble in 2016, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; issue. " created="Sun, 09 Jun 2019 14:37:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So at a minimum, the Warren position papers should be hosted on a domain that Warren owns. They should have a near-perfect archive, and be ready to redirect to the archive when there's an outage. " created="Sun, 09 Jun 2019 14:40:16 GMT" collapse="false">
						<outline text="Jon: I gather from your previous email that Medium offers part of this service. That's a surprise to me. I know they did at one time, but I also heard stories about them canceling the feature, and thereby taking content offline. At least there's confusion as to whether they offer the feature, but here's the really important thing -- they can change their policy at any time, and they &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; changed policies, and business models, many times. So there's no argument possible that Medium has allowed for survival of writing they host beyond their own existence, when there's no guarantee that they, or their survivors would be bound by that commitment. In tech we have lots of experience with companies going back on their promises, esp when they get in trouble and have to refinance. " created="Sun, 09 Jun 2019 14:58:55 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Probably the best place to host her position papers is on elizabethwarren.com, a site they already own. I understand why they wouldn't want to mess with their fund-raising site, if so create a sub-domain. If they're posting their position papers there, then they should use that URL in their promotions, and then as far as I'm concerned, the problem is solved. They are no longer sending a message to users that Medium is a safe place to post, they're not helping to make Medium &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail&quot;&gt;too big to fail&lt;/a&gt;, which right now, they certainly are. A crash of Medium would be a shock to the web the way the crash of Lehman Brothers was to the financial markets. " created="Sun, 09 Jun 2019 14:44:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PS: I wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/forTheRecordBlogging/&quot;&gt;For-the-Record Blogging&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that outlines a strong solution to this problem. " created="Sun, 09 Jun 2019 14:53:28 GMT"/>

					<outline text="My longtime friend Stan Krute sent an email asking how I do my blog. Rather than do a one-off email, I am going to explain it via blog post, so it's documented publicly." created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:04:17 GMT" flNumberedSubs="true">
						<outline text="In the spring of 2017, I wrote a piece of software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;. It's a Node.js server app that is configured via a big JSON file. It handles incoming REST-style messages telling it to build blogs that it knows about via the JSON file. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:05:35 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I write the blog content with an outliner, and the result is a big OPML file. The server software (Old School) knows where to look for the OPML file, via the config.json file. You can use any outliner to edit the content as long as it produces an OPML file as output. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:06:36 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I archive the content of the blog in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see how the content works, going back to May 2017. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:09:57 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The &amp;lt;head&gt; elements of the OPML file also configure Old School and it contains information other applications might find useful. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:26:45 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for Old School on my blog. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:32:10 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Even though Old School is undocumented and unsupported, I did provide an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog/tree/master/examples/helloworld&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt;. Never know when I will need to install a second instance." created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:34:06 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The outliner I use is called Electric Outliner. I've never shipped it, and don't have any plans to. I got tired of supporting &quot;products&quot; that few if any people use. This, and Old School were the first two products I made just for myself. It's cool, because the users of the product really respect &lt;i&gt;the hell&lt;/i&gt; out of the developer, and the developer knows the users will understand the software even with no docs. :smile:" created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:27:30 GMT"/>
						<outline text="You can use &quot;LO2&quot; -- it's very similar to EO, in fact the core outliner is the same code. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:28:49 GMT"/>
						<outline text="If I want to attach a video to a post, I add an attribute called &lt;i&gt;urlvideo, &lt;/i&gt;which points to a YouTube file. The runtime of the blog, a browser-based JavaScript app, looks for these attributes when the page is loaded, and builds the necessary structures. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:08:25 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Similarly for &lt;i&gt;urltweet, &lt;/i&gt;which points to a tweet. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:09:47 GMT"/>
						<outline text="If you put an attribute named &lt;i&gt;flNumberedSubs&lt;/i&gt; on a headline, Old School generates an &amp;lt;ol&gt; element. &lt;i&gt;flBulletedSubs&lt;/i&gt; generates an &amp;lt;ul&gt; element." created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:11:20 GMT"/>
						<outline text="If you put an attribute named &lt;i&gt;image&lt;/i&gt; on an element, its value should be the address of an image, i.e. something that can be put in the src attribute of an &amp;lt;img&gt; element. Old School adds it to the output with a CSS style of float: right. That's how I create right-margin images that I love so much. " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:12:16 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/07/21/trumpHead.png"/>
						<outline text="That reminds me, you can use emoji &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;short codes&lt;/a&gt;. :boom: " created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:14:23 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Old School also supports a glossary, a CMS idea that goes back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/claydataglossary.html&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;. It's a simple two-column table represented in an outline. It does string substitutions of the top-level string with its sub-head's value. The glossary I use for Scripting News is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/misc/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt; in the repo.
