Should it be Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle or Breakfast of Champions. I've read Sirens of Titan so many times, I have it practically memorized. I'm thinking Breakfast because the narrator is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Malkovich&quot;&gt;John Malkovich&lt;/a&gt;.

I have an RSS feed to test with. I just want to try it out, if it works I'll pay $14 a month, but I need to add CSS. I'm not willing to create a paying account until I know it'll work. It's often difficult by design to get out of those deals. " created="Tue, 30 Jul 2019 16:14:05 GMT" type="outline"/>

Centers on a complicated British family. It'll probably look very dated in five years. They don't imagine much that isn't already well underway. It's well-done enough that it pulled me through all six episodes, the first five I &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge-watching&quot;&gt;binged&lt;/a&gt;, in time to watch the finale last night.

				<outline text="I've been using a private Facebook group to keep in touch with friends around the world on the new place I got in the country. It's not something I want to share publicly because I've learned that the personal stuff you share publicly is no longer personal. It's almost mathematical. But there are friends who I'd like to keep in the loop that don't/won't use Facebook. I sort of support them, but then again, I'm sure I pump Exxon gasoline into my car, even though the station has another brand name on it. Being alive in 2019 involves being on Facebook's human network, because it is the greatest single common denominator. But I do need a good way to communicate with those who aren't on it. I'm reminded of that every day. " created="Tue, 30 Jul 2019 13:48:42 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="One of the reasons I'm going to have an email version of this blog is so I can encourage personal friends to read what I write here.

					<outline text="And since it's become more common to have a JSON version too, if present its name differs from the XML-based feed only by the suffix. It has the same name except it ends with .json instead of .xml. So the JSON version of the example would be nightlyRss.json." created="Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:38:49 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I'm doing an interesting project, reviewing all the top-level pages on the &quot;RSS 2.0&quot; spec, checking every link to see if it's broken. For those that are, I try to come up with a suitable replacement, usually the archive.org snapshot taken around the time the page was written. If it isn't broken I don't do anything. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/rss2specbrokenlinks.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; with all the links I've found. Most of the external links are gone, but there are some surprises, sites that have been well-preserved, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000967.html&quot;&gt;Jeremy Zawodny's&lt;/a&gt;. I just came across a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://static.userland.com/gems/backend/gratefulDead.xml&quot;&gt;first podcast feed&lt;/a&gt;, it's still there. I'm not sure how, but it is. This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration&quot;&gt;restoration&lt;/a&gt; project, started because there was breakage caused by the move to HTTPS on the server. That breakage has been fixed. I also changed the line-endings from carriage-return to linefeed, which now is the almost-universal standard. At the time, 2003, it was still kind of muddy. As a result you can now read the source of the pages in a current browser. The site is a relic. It's a good idea to fix the broken links every 15 years or so. :boom:" created="Mon, 22 Jul 2019 15:04:22 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/07/22/rssShirt.png"/>
				<outline text="I'll probably continue to post notes here as I go along. There were two crucial broken links on the home page of the spec: 1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc822.html&quot;&gt;RFC 822&lt;/a&gt;, and 2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thetwowayweb.com/payloadsforrss&quot;&gt;Payloads for RSS&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are integral to the format. I tried to find a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt&quot;&gt;solid link&lt;/a&gt; to the RFC that would stand the test of time. And I discovered that I had copied the Payloads doc, which was originally on a domain that I let go, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/payloadsForRss.html&quot;&gt;the RSS site&lt;/a&gt;. So I'm going to use that link, instead of an archive.org link." created="Mon, 22 Jul 2019 15:16:21 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="This project gives an idea of how important archive.org is going to be to web restorations. Their snapshots are invaluable. Most sites are very temporary things. A great example, I did a project with Jim Moore and Nicco Mele at the Dean campaign in January 2004, an aggregate of a lot of the Dean blogs in RSS format. The Dean campaign was a seminal event in the bootstrap of political blogging. Dean was the first &quot;Web Candidate,&quot; certainly not the last. All the websites that the Dean people started are gone today, including the project I did with them, but they're all there on archive.org, so I was able to do a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/howChannelDeanCameToBe.html&quot;&gt;decent restoration&lt;/a&gt; of that project.

Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glamour.com/story/kate-mckinnon-best-celebrity-impressions-on-saturday-night-live&quot;&gt;Kate McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can leave the &lt;a href=&quot;https://elizabethwarren.com/&quot;&gt;Democratic nominee&lt;/a&gt; to talk about health care, securing the borders, the basic values of America.

I was living in the 50s at the time, so was unaffected. We never lost power. I walked downtown to see what it was like. It felt post-apocalyptic, like visiting New Orleans after Katrina. The weirdest thing was walking north on Broadway in the dark, and seeing Times Square in the distance, fully lit. How like New York, I thought. It's a place of business first. The show must go on.

Probably shouldn't even ask for two phones these days, it's kind of an obsolete concept. Anyway, my gripe is this. After carefully composing the message, I spaced out on copying it to the clipboard, a time-honored defense against buggy software, it just cleared the form after I clicked the Send button, which was a WTF moment for me. Much better would be to confirm that the mail was sent, both on-screen and via an email. Now I'm in a place where I don't know if the email was sent, certainly don't want to re-write the message, and in case the other one &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; sent, it'll look like I'm crazy for sending the same message twice, but with different words.

Here's what I think happened. Nixon. Watergate. The country needed to cleanse itself so it elected a Mr Rogers type, Jimmy Carter, who we knew for sure wouldn't do the nasty stuff Nixon was doing. He came into DC thinking he could change things, instead DC ignored him, and everyone could see it/feel it, and then the hostage crisis, the failed rescue, America was mostly over Nixon and we wanted to kick ass and Reagan came along and said Let's Kick Ass and people looked at Carter, talking about a great national malaise, and there were gas lines, and the world was pushing us around so we said Fuck yeah. So the Repubs found something that worked, and the Dems never caught on. So maybe AOC et al are right, the Repubs are buffoons and criminals, and everyone knows it, including most voters, so what a Democrat has to do is say we kick ass, but we're a team and we have to work together. I don't know, it could work. I think the most convincing character running for president is Jay Inslee, believe or not.

But that mainly comes up when I am silenced or put down because of age. In my heart the future is as much mine as it is some arrogant naive and clueless 30-something person.

				<outline text="An idea for a Netflix-style scifi, tragicomedy, about a race of aliens that are actually bacteria that fly between solar systems in alien spacecraft landing on inhabited planets and reducing the dominant species to slaves. They are transmitted from human to human via farts. Most humans die when infected, some survive, to be controlled by the alien life form, and to infect others of course. But a very tiny minority resist both dying and being controlled, but they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; transmit the infection, and they must race to develop an antidote or else humanity is doomed. Hilarity ensues when people develop ways to be insulated from each other's farts, or when it's impossible, killing infected humans before they can transmit the disease. Rumors fly that certain races and religions are especially virulent transmitters. Time is running short when Season 1 ends.
