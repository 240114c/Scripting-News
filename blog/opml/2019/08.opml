				<outline text="I've been reading a lot about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.media.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; lately. I read that founder of the lab, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte&quot;&gt;Nicholas Negroponte&lt;/a&gt;, made a deal with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Rossetto&quot;&gt;Louis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Metcalfe&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/a&gt;, the founders of Wired, he bought 10 percent of the magazine for $75K and got a column on the inside back cover, which was prime real estate. This got me thinking. The Media Lab and Wired were made for each other. I loved Wired, but I also was aware that they went for gee-whiz tech over substantial tech more than I wished they would. The Media Lab produced lots of buzzworthy demos that never turned into usable tech. What I really wanted? A Wired/Media Lab that only covered open source tech. It was the style of Wired that attracted me, at the time all tech pubs were made for geeks who were suspicious of anything that looked too slick. I want beautiful artistic simplicity, the kind of look that Wired was so good at, applied to practical almost mundane tech. The developers who love all that stuff are the people I want to work with. Stuff that works and that can change the world right now, looking good, not popcorn-like gee-whiz tech that has limited depth or substance.

I think it's because I'd like to link to them as much as I link to any other site. I used up my monthly quota just writing the above bit. Wired is a record, like my blog, of where we came from. That its access is limited, while I understand why, is also limiting access to the record. " created="Sat, 31 Aug 2019 15:30:42 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="By the time I was in my 40s, after decades of listening to the same stories over and over, I started numbering them. As he would start the story, I'd say oh that's #285.

This was a good idea. And I'm glad I have control of everything about it, instead of using one of the commercial services. I have my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;blogging software&lt;/a&gt;, and it's way better than the stuff you get from commercial services. Makes sense I should have as much flexibility with the mail feature. I'm still trying to figure out how to integrate the feature in the home page of the blog. I don't want it to be too intrusive, but I also want people to see it because like everyone else I want people to subscribe.

It's so amazing to listen to music you loved 30 years ago. Somehow all that remains are good memories. They flood in, it's a pure happy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia&quot;&gt;nostalgic&lt;/a&gt; feeling. The way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus&quot;&gt;Don Draper&lt;/a&gt; meant it. A time you were loved. The pain from an old wound. Far more powerful than a memory alone.

Recall I asked about the risks for a news org that disclaimed up front that they were not using journalistic practices, and only reported on what was obviously true. &lt;a href=&quot;Occam's News site:scripting.com&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt;.

First Occam's News wouldn't have to say why they know it's true that Trump is a Russian oligarch, but if they did, they might use the equivalent of the mathematical &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction&quot;&gt;Proof By Contradiction&lt;/a&gt;, and start with the assumption that Trump is not a Russian oligarch, and prove that's not possible.

Doesn't bother with official statements or press releases. We don't interview people on the record. It disclaims up front that &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; follow standard journalistic practices. For example, it's obvious that Trump is a Russian oligarch. He meets all the qualifications. So we say that's what he is, in addition to being president of the United States. All our reporting starts with that premise, and reports Russian and American policy as linked. It's news when they deviate. We also assume that climate change is real. It's never subject to question in our reporting. &quot;Moscow Mitch&quot; is a popular example of Occam's News philosophy. The guy is owned by Moscow. He doesn't hide it. Etc. So the question for lawyers is what are the legal risks? It's not satire, not meant to be humorous (though of course sometimes the truth is funny).

So here's why it works that way.  " created="Sun, 25 Aug 2019 15:06:21 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/02/mrFrog.png"/>

(No such features have been implemented yet.)" created="Sun, 25 Aug 2019 15:07:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We've been down this road before, it's not new territory. Back in the 90s and early 00s, we had blog hosting here, each blog had its own identity namespace. So I know how much human work it is to maintain such a service. I've done it." created="Sun, 25 Aug 2019 15:09:20 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I've always seen software as a creative thing, like writing, painting or sculpting, but the rest of the world can't seem to process this idea.

					<outline text="I do make money, from time to time, by selling something I've created, but most of what I create doesn't make money, the opposite, it costs me money to make. It's been that way ever since I was in my 20s and left Madison for Silicon Valley to make my fame and fortune. Like a musician goes to Nashville or Memphis, I'd say to my friends. I'm pretty sure they didn't believe me. I got lucky a few times, my products were hits, and I sold them to companies. I've tried being a CEO, and was able to do the job, sort of, but every day when I wake up, I'd rather create something than manage something. I don't like being responsible for other people's careers. So once was enough for being a CEO. It worked, we were able to go public, and the money I made made it possible for me to live a creative life, which is where I am most comfortable, most myself." created="Sat, 24 Aug 2019 13:44:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I make software for others. More recently I've made products only for myself, with pretty great results.

				<outline text="JavaScript drives program writers to outliners, because outliners are adept with dealing with nested callbacks, as opposed to the way most (all?) other languages do program flow through a flat list. In a normal language, the runtime proceeds from statement 1 to 2 and so on. I guess most JS programmers don't know about outliners, or devtools developers don't or whatever -- so instead of letting the &quot;problem&quot; be solved by editors, the language designers try to hack the language to make it better fit the editors we already use, but it just creates a hierarchic chaos that's meant not to look hierarchic. It's a total mess. So now JS is evolving to be Perl whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;There's more than one way to do it.&quot; It's far better for the ecosystem if there was only one way to do everything, but something as fundamental as program flow, I doubt if even Perl has more than one way to do &lt;i&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt; So Brendan Eich is not an outliner person, and neither are the people who work on the design of the language. You pretty much have to program JS in an outliner (as I do) to see this, imho. But before they hack the language again, see if the problem isn't the dev tools, not the language. Nothing wrong with callback hell imho if you have the right editor. " created="Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:54:45 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/19/deweyDefeatsTruman.png"/>

In practice 99.9999 percent of those simply want to wait for the I/O to be done. In all my years programming before JS, I never wanted a language to do flow the way JS does.

I was unaware of this perspective and it was enlightening. I have studied both. Slack has the API, Dropbox went it alone. I think if Dropbox had fully embraced the idea that it was a developer's platform, there were a few small doors they had to open, they would have become the storage for networked apps. Same with Amazon S3. Each had the opportunity to bridge into the others' space, but neither has. I think the assumption at Dropbox was they knew everyone who was capable of making great groupware apps. That was their mistake. It's still not too late, they are dominant and totally baked in.

This was the same problem with software reviews, back when they did reviews of software (too bad they stopped). They would review the software based on a day's worth of use, if that much. But we design software so that it gets better the more you use it. We balance the tradeoffs. Of course we want the product to be easy to learn, but we also want it to be something you use all the time. It's as ridiculous to judge a serial show based on a third of a season. If I make it through the whole season, which seems likely based on the first season, I'll review the whole thing here on my blog.

					<outline text="They aren't the only ones, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; is very good too, but AWS does more.

					<outline text="First, I have to say AWS docs appear to have all the information about their services. So I can't say their docs are the worst in all ways, they aren't. The problem is the way the docs are written and organized makes it too hard for a newcomer, or someone who only wants to use the most basic functions, slightly beyond Hello World, to find the information they need. First you have to understand everything about the toolkit, and it's presented in a disjointed fashion where the docs assume you already know everything, which makes it virtually impossible for you to get the data you want. Every time I master another AWS toolkit it seems I write one of these pieces to commemorate the experience and hope somehow to encourage Amazon to make it easier for me next time. :boom:" created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:23:13 GMT"/>

The only &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1159477988712439809&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; was that every email I sent via their service arrived in Gmail with a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that it could be from a hacker (I knew it wasn't, it came from me). It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I learned what was happening and what I had to do to prevent it. " created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:25:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First what was happening: I was sending an email from dave.winer@gmail.com through amazonses.com. Gmail said we got the mail, but noticed you didn't send it through gmail.com. Therefore the the big colorful &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:27:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What I had to do to prevent it: &lt;i&gt;Send the email from another domain and convince Amazon that I was authorized to use that domain.&lt;/i&gt; " created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:27:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is the place to note that nowhere in the Amazon docs do they say it this clearly. They try to tell you what to do on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/spf.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; with lots of links that center around a protocol called SPF. It turns out that SPF simply requires you to create a TXT record on the domain with a string that says what mail servers are allowed to use it to send mail, and that would be enough to convince AWS that you're cool. It makes sense, it connects the domain with a mail server. The person who set up the TXT record obviously is a god of that domain. But when I set this up per their instructions AWS still called the sender address invalid. " created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:30:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then it turns out that I have to use a command line tool to give me a special domain name, and an encrypted value. This contradicts the earlier docs. And I had no idea how to get the command line tool to do this (it seems this would have been a good place for their docs to tell you or link to a place that tells you, but they don't). " created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:40:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It was at this point that I put the project down for a bit, went on Twitter, checked email, went for a walk, did something to cleanse the mental &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate_cleanser&quot;&gt;palate&lt;/a&gt;, came back to the problem and found docs that provided yet another option for convincing AWS that I was authorized to use an email address. " created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:32:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses-procedure.html&quot;&gt;interactive way&lt;/a&gt; to do it through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1#verified-senders-email:&quot;&gt;control panel&lt;/a&gt; for SES. This method worked, and in a familiar way. You tell it what email address you want to use and it sends a message to that address with a link. When you click the link AWS authenticates the address. Everyone who uses the web in 2019 knows how to do this. Why didn't their docs say up front, hey there's a very very very easy way to do this. " created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:41:29 GMT"/>

I got fed up with this because I just wanted to deploy applications and didn't care about all this extra stuff, so Jake Savin and I wrote what we called &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090303082440/http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;A Busy Developer's Guide to SOAP&lt;/a&gt;. It defined a subset of SOAP that we had verified that works, and provided examples for developers of SOAP implementations to test with to be sure they worked with this subset. We published it, and then logged off the mail lists and got to work writing our blogging and RSS software. It worked. We got what we wanted and the big companies got to add all kinds of extra stuff. It seems to me that AWS is in a similar place. Developers like me who want to build apps, and systems people who want to cover all the bases. " created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:49:29 GMT"/>

					<outline text="TL;DR -- everyone in tech could benefit from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science&quot;&gt;semester&lt;/a&gt; of Computer Science, to help them understand how the products are created.

					<outline text="I was just telling a story to Kevin Tofel over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KevinCTofel/posts/10157548873102082&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; about my first experiences dealing with analysts in the tech industry in the 80s. Kevin is a journalist and a consultant for tech companies. He plays a similar role to the early analysts, in today's context. He's taking Computer Science classes. I've been following along, remembering when the concepts he's learning now were fresh for me. It was a great time of discovery, I love how computers work, then and now -- and it's gratifying, in a way, that they still teach the same basic data structures. I guess they never change? I like that. Linked lists, balanced trees, hash tables and the like. I hope they have him build a compiler, that was the last mystery for me. Once I understood that there's no magic to it, I was ready to learn everything about computers. " created="Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:45:26 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/05/norm.png"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, it amazed me when I was starting out in tech that the expensive analysts had never taken a class in computer science. Didn't understand the basic components of a computer. I wasn't sure how to talk to them. I wanted someone to understand how our outliners worked, and how we had tried two internal models before finding a third that had the good qualities of both and none of the bad. I thought one of the analysts should understand how the increasing capabilities of PCs made these decisions easier, and how we were planning future products based on further expected improvements. When you come down to it, the algorithms Kevin is learning now were important performance considerations for the software we were making, especially in the 80s when computers weren't as capable as they are today. " created="Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:40:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then I sold out to a medium-size tech company and they did their strategic planning by inviting one of the analysts in, asking what they should do, and then doing what they said. It was as if you ran a $100 million software company by asking Norm what products you should make. (Norm is Kevin's dog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMMhZu6-zCM9bc-4Tc6AJP46Hx1tiS-A9BEHNUfFy0YQsp8tlynNOauUt_dy8VVVA?key=RTlfWVQ0T21IbTVnZE9laGMtak55dWR4cVdNV01R&quot;&gt;cute&lt;/a&gt; and opinionated, but not too knowledgable about the economics of software.)" created="Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:43:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What I learned is this -- you have to relate to the analysts based on feelings. They have to feel as if you know what you're doing and then they'll echo what you say in your press releases to reporters looking for a quote. Another way to get them on your side was to pay them, by subscribing to the newsletters ($495 per year) and going to their conferences (another $2K per), and if you really were rich you could buy their consulting services (I suppose that the company I sold out to did).
