Next question.&quot; Someone says go ahead impeach Trump, we'll have Pence, he's even worse, this is what you say. &quot;He couldn't win re-election as governor of Indiana, what makes you think he'd do so well in the 2020 election, assuming the Repubs even nominate him.&quot; " created="Mon, 30 Sep 2019 14:54:05 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/30/russianDressing.png"/>

					<outline text="I watched the last Mets game of the 2019 season yesterday. I guess  alot of people did, we wanted to see the rarest of things -- a Mets home run hitter. No Met had ever had the most home runs in MLB in a season, but Pete Alonso, a rookie pulled it off. He also set the record for most home runs in a season by a rookie. And he has a flair for public relations and is a natural born leader." created="Mon, 30 Sep 2019 13:31:29 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/30/metsCap.png"/>
					<outline text="The game went into extra innings, and it looked for sure that the Mets would lose it after unbelievably bad relief pitching, which for the 2019 Mets is saying a lot. But in the bottom of the 11th, a miracle. With runners on first and second, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-dominic-smith-walk-off-home-run-atlanta-braves-20190929-now4zxifajf6zaja7al57ystau-story.html&quot;&gt;Dom Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who had been injured and hadn't come to the plate since July, hit a three-run home run for a dramatic and hugely spirited walk-off win. It's fitting that the Mets didn't make the playoffs this year, and also fitting that this lovely young team went out with such a flourish after it appeared the season would end in utter disappointment. " created="Mon, 30 Sep 2019 13:33:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've loved the Mets since 1962. It's a family tradition among the Winers and Kieslers. There's a new crew, rookies, a Cy Young winner and the certain Rookie of the Year. And an awkward but fun and loving group of misfits who somehow reach into your heart and give you a glimpse of their coming greatness. This is the cycle of the Mets.

As I said yesterday, and it bears repeating, that all the Beatles albums are deeply ingrained in who I am. All my early life experiences connected with every other period of my life. I started listening to the Beatles early in life and never stopped. But I only hear the Beatles, I only hear Abbey Road on the new mixes. It doesn't sound any different from other mixes. I wish it did, because I'd love to have more Beatles revelations at my age, which also has significance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCTunqv1Xt4&quot;&gt;in Beatles terms&lt;/a&gt;.

At other times they interviewed Mets and Braves players from the dugout. They talked about how nice everyone is, at length. How Alonso must feel now, after hitting the home run, in great detail without any input from Pete, who was on the field at first base, crying. I wondered who likes this style of baseball. I saw him hit the 53rd home run, I was happy for him. But the actual news is that the Mets season is over. And the &lt;i&gt;bad news&lt;/i&gt; is that these idiots will be doing the broadcasts for much of the postseason baseball which starts next week. I know this isn't what's wrong with America, but it's a symptom of what's wrong.

The management and coaching would take a hit with fans beause they wasted their attention on giving an old player a stage to perform his last season. Kind of makes each game an exhibition, not a serious contest. Might sell a few more tickets, but maybe it'd have the opposite effect, the embarrassment of being Melo rubs off on the team. Even worse, what if they came close, and there's another forward they could have gotten that critics think might have made the difference. Meanwhile Melo was trading jersies with stars on other teams for photo ops. I feel for Melo. I wouldn't want to be where he is. He's more like a mascot than a player.

					<outline text="I'm returning my old Apple Watch for a $100 credit after getting a new 5th generation watch (I will write it up later). I've done this before and remember the process was easy because they designed the docs well, and took out all the unnecessary steps (something designers call factoring). But this time, instead of writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/27/watchDoc.png&quot;&gt;the instructions&lt;/a&gt; in a language I understand they use pictures with &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/ph19302&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/HT204568&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/HT210225&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of problems there. First, they use a very light color to print the URLs and they're too small for me to read, even with my glasses. I used my iPhone's flashlight, but the paper is glossy. I ended up taking a picture of the doc, and blowing it up. Second, couldn't they use a URL shortener? Didn't someone at Apple suggest that? I can't imagine it would cost that much.

				<outline text="The human species has been on a drive to growth from the beginning. The way to survive was to have lots of kids to insure that some would survive to reproduce, thereby continuing our own DNA and insuring the survival of the species. Until the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic&quot;&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt; and mass production of fossil fuel, and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System&quot;&gt;forms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport&quot;&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt;, we were in balance with nature. But some time in the last hundred years the balance flipped, growth skyrocketed, and processes were set in motion that got us to today's climate crisis. Problem is that we, as a species, haven't evolved, our evolution-driven goals haven't changed, we still think having more children is a virtue, and that it's our right, even obligation, to consume more. Reversing that is not a simple matter (that's generous, in my heart I don't think it's even possible), and the problem was not created by one or two generations, as some of the young folk believe. The problem is with the nature of our species, the traits that evolution reinforced are the ones that are leading us off the climate cliff. So when I listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg&quot;&gt;Greta's&lt;/a&gt; speech, she isn't speaking just for her generation, she's speaking for mine too, and for my parents, who are gone. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://eve.scripting.com/2006/11/01&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 2018, was passionate about consuming less. Greta would have liked her, I think. Yes we knew we were going off a cliff, even people who say they aren't sure, they knew too. But turning the ship around isn't something you decide to do. We each can do it ourselves, but that won't make a difference. I don't have the answers, but I know for certain that blaming today's adults for the future that today's children face is wrong.  Making other people the symbol of our grief for our species is typically human, and pointless." created="Tue, 24 Sep 2019 14:51:28 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/24/ship.png"/>

First, Trump doesn't care if there's an actual investigation. He wants Zelensky to say there was, and Biden &amp; Biden are being charged with something heinous that carries the death penalty in Ukraine. That's the first round of hype.

They illustrate more generally that political parties play dirty when they realize they can't stay in power any other way. But -- consider this sentence -- &quot;The only way out of this situation is for the Republican Party to become more diverse.&quot; As a programmer, which teaches me to challenge my assumptions, it's a critical part of design and debugging, I see that it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the only way out. Political parties aren't like baseball teams. As long as there's baseball, your favorite team will continue, though they could move or change their name. For example, the Washington Nationals are the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals#Montreal_Expos&quot;&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt;. But the same must not be true of political parties. The Repubs had a good run, but they went down a path that didn't work. So they lose elections. What of it. There's no way the Democrats will rule the whole country unopposed for any amount of time -- a new party will form. In all likelihood two new parties will form. There aren't enough white Christians in the US to rule, and many of them, esp the young ones, see themselves as part of a diverse America.

				<outline text="When I was a college student in New Orleans in the 1970s, I used to hang out at restaurants and bars on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Street_(New_Orleans)&quot;&gt;Oak St&lt;/a&gt; in Uptown. It's very close to the line separating the city and Jefferson Parish, and like most political lines in the area, it's marked by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee&quot;&gt;levee&lt;/a&gt;. If one side floods it doesn't necessarily mean that the other does. It was also very close to the Mississippi River, which of course also has a levee. In this case you walk up the levee, and the river comes to within a few feet of the top, way above the level of the city. If the levee were to break, a huge volume of river water would flood the city. I understood at an intellectual level how precarious this place was. But Oak St was an affluent street in a mostly affluent area. Living there you had the sense that it will always be this way. It seemed impervious to catastrophe. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html&quot;&gt;Thirty years later&lt;/a&gt;, after Katrina, I came back and Oak St was destroyed. A fire had raged through the area, unchallenged by fire fighters who were gone. The civilization that seemed so dependable had folded. The people had moved to other cities. New Orleans was almost empty. The point of the story is that climate change may seem theoretical because you live near an Oak St in whatever town you are in. But its stability, the foundation it's built on, is mostly in your imagination.

I think in the early days, before the web, they did create some influential stuff, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/history.html&quot;&gt;Logo language&lt;/a&gt;. What's been uncovered in this scandal is how little is created with all the millions of dollars of funding, not just at the MIT Media Lab, but at all the media labs everywhere. Moral of the story, at least in this round of tech, money isn't what creates new media, individuals with a vision who persevere do.

				<outline text="A minor league football coach could figure out how to beat Trump. It requires minor collaboration between the Democratic Party and the entertainment world. We need programming to go up against Trump. The programming has to be about Trump, because he's made himself the story. But it has to tell the story he doesn't want told, in as dramatic a fashion as he tells his story. It doesn't have to be good drama, it won't reach into your soul and make you cry, it doesn't need to because Trump can't do that. What it has to do is fill you with rage. Grab and hold your attention. But it must not be done by the Democratic candidate. The Republican team only has one play. It's a game where the quarterback runs. So you just fill the field with defensive backs. When Trump moves, destroy him. When he moves again, destroy him again. With what? Acting, childish pranks and low comedy.

In other binges, I've started to work on season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;, just watched the first episode.

					<outline text="I was writing a bit of example code for another package I am working on. I iterated over it, factoring and simplifying until it was really easy to see what's going on.

" created="Sat, 07 Sep 2019 14:14:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then I decided to add a small feature that required a tiny bit of persistent data, a serialnum. Of course this comes up all the time, I have a standard practice for it.

" created="Sat, 07 Sep 2019 14:15:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In Frontier, of course, saving a scalar with persistence is simply a matter of assigning a value to it. The kernel takes care of everything else.

And when they added the Proxy feature, it did become possible. " created="Sat, 07 Sep 2019 14:16:33 GMT"/>

					<outline text="The history of RSS is usually told only in one dimension, it’s the story of geeks fighting with geeks, so they say, but in my humble opinion, that’s really not the story." created="Tue, 03 Sep 2019 13:39:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Most of the vocal people on the mail lists, blogs and wikis are more fans than creators. It’s as if we confused baseball players with people who sit in the stands watching a baseball game. Sure, both wear caps and want their team to win, but one actually does something about it, while the others expresses an opinion. There are a lot of fans, but relatively few people who actually do anything."/>
					<outline text="Mike Lopez, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/#comment-1302&quot;&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on this blog yesterday recalls a story he heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195825&quot;&gt;on NPR&lt;/a&gt; about basketball great Wilt Chamberlain and his relationship with fans.

Welcome to the Internet. Community participation is both its strongest and weakest point. And those who say I’m a consistent supporter of the medium miss that I am as frequently its victim. Sadly. "/>
					<outline text="The NY Times is not a sideline player in the history of RSS, as I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/20/rss-came-from-the-publishing-industry-2/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, they played a central role, first denying us permission to use their content, then allowing it, and in doing so, providing an example for the rest of the publishing industry, which followed their lead without undermining them, without reinventing the technology, to their credit." created="Tue, 03 Sep 2019 13:32:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It was on this day &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/02/09.html&quot;&gt;in 2001&lt;/a&gt; that I received a call from a “Rights and Contracts manager” at the New York Times, she asked us to stop reading their XML newsfeeds. I complied with the request. A colleague who will remain nameless had snuck me a link to an unprotected directory where the feeds, in a proprietary XML-based format, resided. I then repurposed the information and published it on a UserLand server. Truth be told, I expected to be shut down, but in doing so, I also expected to get the attention of higher-ups at the Times (who I knew read my blog) and it surely did." created="Tue, 03 Sep 2019 13:31:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then early in 2002, I had a dinner with Martin Nisenholtz and Times board member Dave Liddle and two San Francisco-based Times reporters, where I pitched them on two things: 1. Publish in RSS, and 2. Give blogs to every Times reporter. They took me up on #1 and in April we published the Times content, but not in RSS (although we were permitted to by our contract), instead using the Times’s proprietary format. Why did we do that? Well I figured that if we pubished in RSS 0.92, which was then our most advanced format, it would drag the Times into a format war and they might think it’s not worth the trouble and ask us to stop publishing their content. So I decided to ease them into the community, first publishing invisibly to the people on the mail lists, and then, once their presence was cemented, we switched over to RSS 2.0." created="Tue, 03 Sep 2019 13:32:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So the loud and obnoxious fans on the mail lists shaped the story, a little. Instead of confronting their loudness, we side-stepped it. Now the Times may or may not be seen as the “tipping point” more widely, but I see it that way. Without the Times, we would have remained in disagreement, stuck in mail list hell, never achieving the promise of the technology. We all owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude, and should learn the lesson well, don’t look for leadership in standards to the netizens or to Silicon Valley, look to users who have a stake in making the technology work. Imho, that’s the key to getting things to move forward."/>

She pointed out this gray cat, see how she's taking care of the sick kitten? I took her home and named her Nurse." created="Sun, 01 Sep 2019 17:34:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Later I moved to Madison, in the middle of the winter. Nurse stayed with my parents in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt; until I found a place to live, and they sent her out by airplane. She must've had a bad experience on the flight or waiting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar&quot;&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;, because when she got to me, she was freaked out.
