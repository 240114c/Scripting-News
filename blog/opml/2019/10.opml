					<outline text="For example this morning they talked for a half hour about the impeachment inquiry as a partisan issue, repeating the Republican claim that it's bad for the inquiry to be private. They said the Democrats in 1998 had the same objection, which wasn't true, because then there was a special prosecutor, Ken Starr, who did his inquiry in private before issuing his public report. As far as I know the Democrats never said this inquiry should be held in public. Even if they had it wouldn't have been. There are rules about the process designed to protect the accused and the process. NPR never presented the other side, how this all looks from the point of view of the Democrats, or more importantly, the Constitution, which is really what Trump has offended.

				<outline text="Brent Simmons wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2019/10/28/no_etas&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; about how he can't say when a certain feature will be available with any accuracy so he doesn't try. I agree with what he said, but you can do it, by keeping a backlog of unreleased debugged features. If you use the feature yourself every day and it works well, you can probably estimate when it will ship to users, because you could do it tomorrow if you wanted (or at least start testing it). This is a weird idea in the old way of doing software, where people always release what they have as soon as they have it. A number of years ago I stopped doing that. I have a backlog of debugged usable stuff that only I have used. So if I announced a feature from the backlog I could definitely predict when it would be available.

				<outline text="Yesterday I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a140306&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; how weird it is to see podcasts be so pervasive. Here's another example. The NY Post has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/charles-oakley-sounds-ready-to-re-enter-the-knicks-fold/&quot;&gt;Knicks podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I will probably listen, from time to time. Today's podcast is with Charles Oakley, a former Knick and fan favorite, who is &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=charles+oakley+james+dolan&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;hated&lt;/a&gt; by James Dolan, which of course makes him even more popular with Knicks fans. He says the Knicks can prove Kevin Durant wrong. Of course they can. The Nets stars need to learn about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=managing+expectations&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;managing expectations&lt;/a&gt;. If the Knicks show up and don't fall apart on the court they will have exceeded the bullshit hype of the Nets stars, both of them great players but probably not in NY after what they've said about the Knicks.

					<outline text="Dreams are so funny. One of my recurring dreams all through my life is not being able to find my way home. I'd start going there, but realize I wasn't getting anywhere. It would go on and on, and I'd never get there. Well last night I had a weird variant on that. I was still trying to get home. I had parked my car somewhere, and was trying to get there, so I could begin my journey, but first I had to call my mother. I couldn't find the phone feature on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+iphone&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. I'd keep navigating through the menus thinking I was on the way to the phone, but I'd get lost and have to start over. It seems my subconscious has completely absorbed the UI of computers as reality. And even though I'm an adult and my mother is gone, I still feel the need to call her. And of course all this is going on inside me even when I'm wide awake. :boom:" created="Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:06:12 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/davescoffee.png"/>
					<outline text="Also in my dreams last night, since I'm on the topic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Newmark&quot;&gt;Craig Newmark&lt;/a&gt; was partying. Dancing, telling jokes, introducing people to other people, being &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=gregarious&quot;&gt;gregarious&lt;/a&gt;. I was surprised because this is out of character for him. He's a very nice, considerate person, in real life. But he seems a bit reserved. I find him hard to read. I've known him since the early days of the web in the Bay Area. I defended him when the press took what I felt were unfair &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22craigslist+killer%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;shots&lt;/a&gt;, taking advantage of the fact that his product had his name in it, blaming him personally for the demise of print news. Ridiculous. So, I was happy to see Craig let go in my dreams. I sometimes say things that might have offended him, but he's never complained. Once I remarked, riding in the back seat of a car with him next to me that it was like being in a car with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Jemima&quot;&gt;Aunt Jemima&lt;/a&gt;. I had gotten the idea from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norton&quot;&gt;Peter Norton&lt;/a&gt;, who like Craig, had personally become a famous brand. He once said he was the Aunt Jemima of software. I thought that was clever. But of course Craig may not see it the same way. I tend to do that, take risks, I probably offend people from time to time, not meaning to, I assure you. I'm nowhere near as rich as Craig. Maybe that's why? :smile:" created="Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:13:29 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/30/craigNewmark.png"/>

				<outline text="A number of people in the town where I now live have blogs and do podcasts.

Like the guy who creates a new computer system in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine&quot;&gt;Soul of  a New Machine&lt;/a&gt; and sees someone using it and thinks you can't use this stuff. Heh. I don't play much of a role in these things anymore. Not sure I'd want to actually, though I think the software most people use for blogging is nowhere near as good or complete as what we had in the early 00s. Just a little factoring and UI reorg would make things flow much better. Podcasting has become a huge undertaking for people, with seasons and episodes, sponsors.  It should be imho like leaving a voice mail to a few friends. Nice thing is today it can easily scale up to millions of friends. That wasn't true at the beginning.

					<outline text="This tale started when the Spectrum app for Roku broke, I could no longer access my favorites. That meant every time I wanted to find a program, I had to fish through all the channels. I've learned over the years which channels I need, basically MSNBC, CNN, HBO, Showtime, the stations that have Law &amp; Order, channels that carry the sports teams I follow. I imagine it's pretty similar for other people. After all these years you develop paths, and program the system accordingly. At this point, I'm not willing to use Spectrum without favorites.

					<outline text="Their support is also ridiculous. They want you to jump through the same set of hoops every time no matter what the problem is.

More evidence -- my Favorites are still there on my iPhone, iPad and in the new Apple TV. " created="Sun, 20 Oct 2019 18:01:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Which brings me to why I was interested in Apple TV in the first place. I thought perhaps I could just use Apple TV to access Spectrum, working around the breakage. $199 is a lot of money to spend to do that, but I had an extra HDMI port open on my TV, and I wanted to see what's new there, so why not.

						<outline text="But there's the problem now of having two remotes. One of my rules for design is &quot;One way is better than two, no matter how much better the second is.&quot; I bet Apple can prove that their remote is better. But on Rokui I think they should just use the Roku remote. I remember when I first shipped Mac software in 1984, I wanted to design my own (better) user interface. After a year or so we gave up on that and just used the Mac standard interface, even though it wasn't good for what we were doing. The pressure not to make people master a second UI was too great.

I watched it, I liked it, but it didn't get me excited and interested like the series did. I decided to re-watch the last season to see what the difference was. There are many great things about the show. The use of music, the weird camera shots that are integrated with the plot. It's artistically ecelectic in so many ways. But it's also &lt;i&gt;slow. &lt;/i&gt;Things develop very very slowly. But there's no space in a 2-hour single-episode show to develop the puzzling intrigue of the series. No time to spread out, relax, take your time, go slow. So not much happens, and then it's over. It's not really Breaking Bad, it's a 2-hour movie with the characters of Breaking Bad. That was the same problem with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood:_The_Movie&quot;&gt;Deadwood movie&lt;/a&gt;.

If she is elected, it would be tragic if she does the same kind of BS that the Republicans do, and tries to make some Americans outcasts. After all, the question she was asked was about other people's &lt;i&gt;beliefs, &lt;/i&gt;not their actions. And as president, her job would be to safeguard their rights, along with those of people she agrees with.

When someone wrote a piece I thought should get on the record, I'd forward it to an email address that was monitored by a script I wrote, which would then add it to the current &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/mail/default.html&quot;&gt;mail page&lt;/a&gt;. It wouldn't publish until I had a chance to hand-edit the text. It was work, and I remember not liking it, but there were some real classics among the mail page posts, so I did the work, for a couple of years.

One in particular was beautifully written, long, detailed and obviously based on a lot of experience. As I read such an email I ache a little. &quot;This should be on the web,&quot; I think to myself. Finally when I get to the end I respond with praise, and a request that they post it to their blog. I put it that way because 1. maybe they have a blog or 2. maybe this will get them to start one. But the most likely response is a story about how they have a blog, but haven't posted to it in a long time and they feel guilty, so presumably they don't want to go there for some reason? I don't really get it, because I know what a blog is, behind the scenes. It isn't a place. It's just a few files on a server, very small files, and a few database entries perhaps.
