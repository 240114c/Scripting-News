We have the archive, in pointers from &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/howPodcastingGotItsName&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;,  to show how the name was chosen. This is even better than &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=contemporaneous+notes&amp;t=hz&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;contemporaneous notes&lt;/a&gt;, the decisions were made online, so the record is perfect, not subject to interpretation. (Unfortunately, Yahoo is taking the archive offline in December, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130410020053/http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/howPodcastingGotItsName&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; has copies.) Hammersely's use of the term in a story is analogous to someone anticipating that Apple's phone would be called iPhone. It would not be correct to say that such a person gave the product its name. I normally don't comment on this, but Naughton is such a careful journalist, no doubt he took the info from the Wikipedia page on podcasting, which is incorrect. At the very least the Wikipedia page should note that their version is contested. " created="Sat, 30 Nov 2019 16:49:16 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/30/apple.png"/>

Instead, I watched a few episodes of the first season of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Larry_Sanders_Show&quot;&gt;Larry Sanders Show&lt;/a&gt; on HBO.

				<outline text="My favorite binges are multi-season dramas with great writing and acting, and a vision from the show runner. Few series are so great that they check all the boxes, but some do. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; was the best of all time. Mad Men had a very strong vision, but the quality of story-telling was spotty, as was Breaking Bad. Deadwood, what a great show, but it ended before it got to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota#19th_century&quot;&gt;punchline&lt;/a&gt;. I like intense political drama and crime stories that get you into the characters. So I'm considering re-watching a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/list/ls049563664/&quot;&gt;HBO miniseries&lt;/a&gt; that got to me the first time: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Kitteridge_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Olive Kitteridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Of&quot;&gt;The Night Of&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Mildred Pierce&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="They do some fancy CGI stuff to show the characters much younger than the actors are today, but it doesn't work. I was thinking about that all through the movie. How old they are now, the staples of a Scorsese gangland movie, De Niro (76), Pesci (76) and one who's not a staple but also ancient, Pacino (79). And how old are they supposed to be in the scene I'm watching now. It was never clear. And the young CGI version of De Niro looks really old and doesn't look like De Niro. " created="Thu, 28 Nov 2019 13:27:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It could have been more emotional, gripping and surprising, as good as any of his films, if he had used new actors. The CGI tricks stole the show and not in a good way, imho. I think that's why The Departed really clicked. None of the usual Scorsese ensemble, the stars were Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Vera Farmiga, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin. They played characters their own age. The story and storytelling took over, I never once thought about the movie-making, was completely captivated by the story.

Watching the Clippers specifically it's sad for me, a Knicks fan, to see that LA has two highly competitive NBA teams and New York has part of one.

				<outline text="I saw a thing on CNN how Trump is using Facebook ads to refute bad news on TV. You wouldn't know if you (like me) are not in his base. They showed a graph with the money spent by various Democrats on FB ads. In total it's small fraction of what Trump is spending. Now I think about Bloomberg's entry into the race in a whole new way. Not only is he rich, and can afford to spend a lot on ads, he also understands tech and media. That's how he made his billions. So when people count him out based on today's polling, they're getting caught in horse-race thinking and forgetting to look at the horse itself. He won't be afraid to use Facebook. He'll have some catching up to do, but he has a mind for tech media and lots of unique experience. Trump should be concerned.

					<outline text="BTW -- the reason &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; got bad reviews is that it isn't what a newsroom really is like.

Dramas depend not on the reality of what they portray, rather the ability of the writers, actors and technical people to tell a story that pulls you in, gets you to care, makes you forget you aren't in their world instead of your own. They become your friends, and you develop an intimacy you can't get with your real friends and family. That's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; is so good. The writing, acting, and everything else are done by people who know how to get you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; you want to go.

					<outline text="Yesterday I wrote about the need for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/18/150738.html&quot;&gt;Marshall Plan for Republicans&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't explain what the original Marshall Plan was. After the Allies won WWII, the US did something unusual for a victor. We rebuilt the country we defeated, Germany. We didn't have to. In fact at the end of WWI we did the opposite. We imposed reparations on Germany. Then came the Depression, and thus were planted the seeds for a rebirth of Germany as an even more ferocious military force in the second war. There was no third war, probably thanks to the Marshall Plan." created="Tue, 19 Nov 2019 13:07:57 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/15/kicker.png"/>

That would come later, during the Obama presidency, when Putin was reinstalling a Soviet style government, and we, via our State Department, were encouraging the opposition. Nothing wrong with that, except it didn't work. And we're left with a Putin who seeks revenge, and knows nothing helps a despot like a foreign enemy to blame everything on. That would be the pre-Trump United States. " created="Tue, 19 Nov 2019 13:10:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now we're on the verge of defeating the Republican Party. I don't want to go into detail on that, I can -- imho it'll seem obvious in hindsight, like the dissolution of the Soviet Union seemed obvious after the Berlin Wall came down, but until it happens it can be hard to visualize. The Repubs have been a fixture in American politics all our lives. But it has been changing all the time, trying to put off the inevitable by becoming more and more insidious relative to constitutional America. And now people of the party, the base, will be forced to decide. Finally we have broken Trump's monopoly on news flow. They're broadcasting the hearings on Fox, they have to. And it's going to get worse, much worse, in the next few days, for the fascists in the Republican Party to keep the base unaware. There is a splitting coming. The question is how big. My believe is that it will be big enough to create an opportunity that we should not miss. A chance to rebuild America before we fully fall apart. To be a Marshall Plan for ourselves. Because now finally we will have to accept Republicans as our fellow Americans, with some differences, important ones, but underneath it all, we don't try to steal elections and we accept that no one is above the law, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; the president.

Obstruction. Nothing happens. And Trump, second of his name, comes along in 2024, this one is not Baby Huey, and a true fascist, much more schooled in the ways of America, and one who plays the part of president much better than this Trump does. That really will be the end of America. We'll be out of moves. " created="Tue, 19 Nov 2019 13:26:48 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/14/bowling.png"/>

Blogging integrated with a feed reader. In 2001. It was the product that defined blogging for many, including people who went on to write popular blogging software. And it was where podcasting was born. Radio was both a podcatcher and a tool for managing a podcast feed. It did both sides. I don't know of any product, 18 years later, that does that. And it was easy. We really honed the UI. By then we really understood blogging, and were ready to make it flow. I would put Radio's design up against any popular blogging software today. I think it would win. " created="Mon, 18 Nov 2019 13:53:08 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/18/radioUserLand.png"/>

Most of the people spoke Chinese. We had to wait quite a while for a table. When we were seated the waiter asked if we were tourists. I laughed and said no we're natives. The funny thing is that not that long ago we were the newbies. The food was fantastic, btw. So many flavors, very satisfying. Before the Chinese came, Flushing was famous for nothing in the way of anything, in the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://macaulay.cuny.edu/seminars/gardner08/articles/f/l/u/Flushing_History_d81a.html#Dutch_Rule&quot;&gt;three centuries&lt;/a&gt; at least. :boom:" created="Sun, 17 Nov 2019 17:21:31 GMT" type="outline"/>

My family drove through there when I was ten years old and I remember it. In the first 20 years I was there, I felt like I had come home.

People were actively interested in music in ways I had never seen. But the insiders desperately didn't want it to change. Is it better that now we can all program our own music? I feel very strongly -- yes. It's hard to imagine that when I grew up I was limited to what was played on the radio and what I could afford to buy. There was so much more music. And music is so personal. All that potential opened up as Napster broke the dam. It was incredible for the users. The people who make and sell music didn't appreciate that or respect that.

And my mom, born in Prague, an American newbie, was angry about the changes that were coming. I was amazed to see this, because she was a very inclusive sort of person, welcoming, and sought out different experiences. And of course she had herself benefited from a country that had its doors open to anyone. When she died, and it came time to sell the house, the neighbors next door begged us not to sell to an Asian family. They were also refugees.

Next would be the indictments for Justice people who started the Mueller investigation, to set an example for the people who remain. Either be loyal to Trump or get out. He probably figured he'd have DoJ and the spy agencies cleaned out by the end of next year. Then, after winning re-election, something Barr couldn't help with, they would be ready for Act Three, replete with goose-stepping storm troopers and gas chambers for people of color and non-Christians. Seems obvious that Trump and Barr's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander/status/1195088750306635785&quot;&gt;animated conversation&lt;/a&gt; was about Barr resigning.

A good journalist could have found plenty to write about that was gripping from many perspectives. It went to the heart of the United States' role in the world. We identify with the people of Ukraine who are struggling to create a civil system like the one we used to have in the US. They were making progress, &lt;i&gt;with our help,&lt;/i&gt; at fighting corruption. Two examples of American goodness testified. And the role of Trump and his mob was to bring American corruption to them. It couldn't be uglier. Maybe it lacked pizzazz if you have no sense of pride in America. I don't know why we place such a high value on journalism, when they fight against us with lunacy like this.

You can say you hear them without selling your soul, or selling out the former Democratic Party base. And that's how the center-left party can emerge.

Like to be sure of their health care. More jobs. Spending more money on domestic stuff as opposed to unwinnable forever wars. What they want, in a word, is security. These are all natural Democratic issues, and somehow via lies and Democratic lunacy the Repubs have been able to at least partially usurp them. That's because the Dems don't claim them.

Humor works, for presidents, only when it's self-deprecating. Otherwise you make a choice, you're the president of everyone, including people with unpopular beliefs, or remain a senator or college professor. Further she throws this at men, for some reason, as if men are the ones who think this about marriage, exclusively. Personally I don't care if you do or don't get married. I don't think the government should be involved. But same-sex marriage is a recent thing, and of course there are people who are uncomfortable with it. Probably MAGA sounds right to them. A president of everyone should re-assure them that they have the right to their belief, and can live their lives accordingly, but they can't control other people. Had Warren said that, that way (without the putdowns) I would have cheered.

Wouldn't be a bad model for a new news org to adopt, up front. :watch:" created="Sun, 03 Nov 2019 15:01:43 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/11/strongman.png"/>

I get it. I tried watching the Nets v Rockets last night. Preferred the Knicks v Celtics. The Knicks are more interesting this year. A mix of young and old. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Barrett&quot;&gt;sensational rookie&lt;/a&gt;. The boring part of the NBA are the corporate players like Kyrie and KD. Mercenaries. Oh we'll occupy the Nets so we can take cheap shots at the Knicks. Wow. Brilliant. No one cares about the Nets. They get their paycheck and they'll move on to humiliate another team next year, until fans get tired of it. Thing is most of the fans already are. Ask Toronto. You know the players must think we don't know it's about teams. We really don't care about them so much. Make good teams and we'll be happy. That's why we like the Celtics, the Bucks, Philly, and guess what the Knicks look okay this year. Someone put some care into creating this team. I think that's what the Knicks have been missing. Someone who cares about them. But the Knicks would've said yes to Kyrie, I'm glad they didn't get the chance.

					<outline text="If you're going to innovate you do it first, and look for funding when you've got something working. You don't wait for anyone's approval, or investors nagging you about when you're going to finish, because if your idea is innovative enough you'll never be able to explain it in words, and you'll learn so much in the process, the idea will sound very different very quickly if it's new enough. People will want to invest when it's up and running. You have to get there first. The innovator goes ahead. The non-innovator doesn't." created="Sat, 02 Nov 2019 13:44:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have several friends who are former journalists who are so driven by what they do they write publicly, even though no one is paying them. What they do is exciting. Their ideas are different and valuable. They get me, their reader, thinking, which imho is the best kind of journalism. They may not know it but they are innovating, and if they keep at it, I think there's a good chance they will have such obvious success that people will want to invest.

					<outline text="I would invest myself if we could put it together as something investible. By that I mean it has a way to grow. That it's not just investing in a few outside-the-box thinkers, but if it could become a place where such thinkers could start, follow their idea, develop their own following, and inspire other thinkers to do what they do. I wouldn't burden it with advertising. I'd let it run for a while, the way they let software developers run without a business model these days, while they test their ideas.

					<outline text="Just thinking out loud here. I am sure there's a new journalism out there, that it's not the journalism that gets so much acclaim, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/12/woodward-bernstein-watergate-donald-trump-era&quot;&gt;reinvention&lt;/a&gt; of Woodward and Bernstein, the two Washington Post innovators who brought down Nixon. We should be way ahead of that by now. We need to be, because the forces opposing democracy, the equivalent of 1974's plumbers, are moving much faster. We're erecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line&quot;&gt;Maginot Lines&lt;/a&gt; now, getting ready to fight the Battle of 2016, ignoring that &lt;i&gt;the enemy already controls our capital. &lt;/i&gt;They've been innovating.
