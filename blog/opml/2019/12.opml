				<outline text="The picture, to the right, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulpfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Jules_Winnfield&quot;&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction&quot;&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/a&gt; is from (I think) the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRE23YfSvc8&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; of the movie. Here's the actual quote. &quot;Say 'what' again. Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say what one more goddamn time!&quot; As Will Campbell says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Samuel-L-Jackson-quotes-from-Pulp-Fiction&quot;&gt;on Quora&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;This entire movie is basically one bag of brilliant quotes.&quot; True. As I slog my way through the end of the last season of The Newsroom, I realize that some script writing is basically one big bag of terrible quotes. Inserted into actual conversations. And the director makes the characters scream the awful quotes as if they're being tortured. It gets so bad at times I turn the volume off. I dream of the characters killing each other in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVQ8byG2mY8&quot;&gt;Scarface-like&lt;/a&gt; ending. I think I have to go back into therapy to find out why I need to see the very end of this terrible show. (BTW one in five scenes is actually pretty good, like every &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDw8EXjusrU&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; with the Assistant Deputy EPA Administrator. And every scene with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn&quot;&gt;Olivia Munn&lt;/a&gt; is amazing. She's magnetic.)" created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 15:20:24 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/31/sayBlockchainAgain.png" urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRE23YfSvc8"/>

					<outline text="The other day candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/30/politics/joe-biden-running-mate-republican/index.html&quot;&gt;Joe Biden said&lt;/a&gt; he's open to choosing a Republican running mate. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1211775820546621441&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; I thought this was a good idea. Now to be clear, he won't choose a Republican running mate. That would be crazy, wrong, too risky by a lot. " created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:17:07 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true">
						<outline text="I'm sure Biden would want a close relationship with his VP, and you just can't have that close a relationship with a member of the other party. " created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:36:33 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Biden is old, and his running mate is important because they are more likely to become president. A Republican in the White House, no matter how inspired a choice, just won't work. " created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:36:44 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Despite all that, it was a good idea, to say it, not to do it. We're at a pivotal point for the future of our republic. The current president has been caught violating the Constitution in the most egregious ways, not just in his dealings with Ukraine. It's clear that Trump doesn't understand the Constitution and has no interest in learning, or being limited by it. He's going to do what he wants to do, the same way a monarch would. This is what the Constitution protects against in a myriad of ways. " created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:21:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We need a two-party system where both parties agree in the rule of law and the Constitution. Where we're Americans first, and partisans a distant second. Not just voters, but the people who lead the parties. Right now we barely have a two-party system because the Repubs are working on behalf of a foreign enemy, and against the Constitution.  " created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:37:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To get back on solid ground, we need to split along respect for the rule of law. One party supports the rule of law, the other party doesn't. That means Democrats, the name of the rule-of-law party, must welcome people who believe in conservative policies that the Repubs used to stand for, but also believe in our system of government. A huge tent. Then, a landslide election, so that the Democrats have control of Congress and the White House and 3/4 of the state legislatures, overcoming Russian/Republican hacking, and so we can pass new amendments to the Constitution to close the loopholes that they have taken advantage of. To codify what previously were just norms." created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:23:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I hear you saying, cynically, that'll never happen. Then my answer to you is this -- we've already lost the republic. There may be elections in the future, but only Republicans will win, the same way only Putin wins elections in Russia. I said in an earlier piece, that some friends took issue with, that the Democratic Party would be annihilated if that happened, and this is what I meant. There might still be an organization called the Democratic Party, but if they can't win elections because of corruption, well it's not really a political party is it?" created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:42:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To win such a landslide, the Democrats will need a lot of votes from people who voted for Trump in 2016. That means compromise. Which is fine because &lt;i&gt;our form of government requires compromise, &lt;/i&gt;when it's working. So Biden saying he would consider a Republican running mate is signalling to people who voted Republican that they are welcome in the new Democratic Party. And in order to work, not only will the Republican Party have to be annihilated once and for all, so will the Democratic Party, and further, journalism will have to be annihilated too. What journalism has morphed into, where they only know about horse races, both-sides-do-it and Watergate, has led us to this place. If they continue to rule our discourse, as they have, we can't get out of the hole we're in." created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:26:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Once all this change has happened, then we can go back to a two-party system. We can decide what &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; mean all over again, because today I feel totally like a conservative even though my beliefs and policies are what we used to think of as liberal. I want to turn the clock back to Eisenhower and JFK, Carter, Reagan, Bush I and Clinton, where the US was fucked up for sure, but we respected ourselves and each other, at least somewhat, enough to accept the result of elections we lose. " created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:43:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Almost everyone has buried their heads in the sand and think oh well nothing has changed, when in fact everything has changed. We no longer have elections that work. Without that, without confidence that the person holding an office was actually elected to that office, we have a monarchy, and autocracy not anything like the system of government the founders designed.

					<outline text="This sounds terrible. Right? Well, it's just like Shariah Law or &quot;chain-immigration.&quot; It sounds like a technical thing, but in reality it's a problem they made up. In practice nothing really is lost. XML sometimes garbles stuff if it isn't properly encoded. The solution is to properly encode it. " created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:04:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="By pointing at this and saying Oooooh silent data loss. Oooh RSS is bad, people who didn't understand would think, oh I need to change to use this new thing. Or so the proponents hope." created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:04:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Just like Shariah Law is not a problem in America, and chain-immigration simply means letting families come to the US (a good thing, most people would think, so why not say it that way, hah), the tech trolls were saying basically that &quot;RSS is XML,&quot; which their format was too. If everything is done right (a big assumption) you could possibly avoid &quot;data loss&quot; by using their format, or you could stick with RSS and properly encode the text. The latter approach is &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; cheaper." created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:03:16 GMT"/>

					<outline text="If you accept the premise that publishing a post is the Hello World of blogging software, as I believe based on 25 years experience, there is a method to straigntening this out. You go through the list above and start eliminating steps, moving the New Post functionality closer and closer to the top and making it more obvious in every step. " created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 15:45:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="BTW, there is a very small Edit link on the published page, presumably I see it because I'm the author and am logged in. Clicking on it takes me to a page I've not seen before. A much nicer-looking post-editing page. I think this should be the home page of the editing function. But even this isn't Gutenberg apparently. There's a prompt at the bottom of the page asking me to try the new block editor to level up your layout. If this is the elusive Gutenberg, they might say so. If you're going to use that as its name publicly the software should use it too. And for crying out loud there is nothing for me to click to try the new block editor. I can get Info or learn more. I just want to try it. Help. " created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 15:46:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I click on the Learn more link and twice it confirms that I am ready to try Blocks. I have to convert the post it warns. OK, since it's just a test post, what the heck. First I have to page through a listicle-like tutorial. And when I get there damn if it doesn't look just like it did before. I don't know why this is so momentous. I'm going to come back to this in my next visit. " created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 15:48:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Flow is the writer's problem for blogging. I have been working on this since I started in 1994. I solved the problem for myself in 1997, and ever since I've been working on solving it for everyone else. Had WordPress designers simply &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2002/01/10/dtwsEditBoxScreen.gif&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; at Radio UserLand, shipped in 2002, and copied its menu structure, they would have a much better flowing blog platform and a reader interface as a central part of the product. But since then Facebook and Twitter have matched or bettered Radio in flow. There's a new benchmark. WordPress appears oblivious. So no I don't think Gutenberg, which is a new text editor for WordPress, is the answer. It is the answer to other problems, how to mix text and other elements in a blog post. Certainly a good thing to do. But WordPress imho remains the klunky monolith that it always has been. " created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 15:28:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One more thing, you can do even better than moving the New Post command to the top of a klunky interface. You can move all the setup stuff off to the side and give the user a Facebook-like interface for writing posts. You could even make Gutenberg the default editor. The text editor imho was never the issue with WordPress -- for writers. Writers can make-do with almost anything there. But the flow from idea to idea is what writers really need. For that you should probably start with an outliner, study it, learn from it and adapt it to public writing. That's where imho the real juice is. " created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 16:11:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But a good short step would be to build a Facebook-like interface for WordPress, working with the same database, so both the current and the writer's view work on the same data. Writers are important and for writers flow is everything, how easily can I get your software out of my way and flow my ideas into the minds of the readers. " created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 16:31:37 GMT"/>

				<outline text="During the 2016 election I watched reruns of The West Wing and found it relaxing, to be able to visualize a government run in a human and intelligent way. Last night, looking for something to watch, I spotted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/the-newsroom&quot;&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and thought I would give it a try. Perfect choice. Another Sorkin show, a bit dated, in terms of tech very dated, but who cares. It's a bunch of actors, some good and famous reading Sorkin dialog about how news would work if it worked well. I've just watched the first three episodes, it's an incredible antidote to the way news is these days. Highly recommended, and as I step through it I expect to have more to say. BTW, it's available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/The-Newsroom-Season-1/dp/B00CW8DRU8&quot;&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon." created="Fri, 27 Dec 2019 13:55:42 GMT" type="outline"/>

I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/20/211446.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; on Apple, but when I picked it up again, starting with episode 4, I couldn't stand it. It was like a bad soap opera. One word: Insipid. Too bad because the actors are great and they had lots of money to do it right. The story is childish and the dialog is embarrassing. Those are also some of my criticisms of The Newsroom (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27.html#a135542&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;) but there is substance in that show and the writing is pure Sorkin, so it's funny to think the actors are just saying what Sorkin told them to say. Like Leo and Bartlet, Josh and CJ. Except not them, other people. And lots of lessons about journalism. For example &lt;a href=&quot;http://pressthink.org/2019/12/the-christmas-eve-confessions-of-chuck-todd/&quot;&gt;Chuck Todd&lt;/a&gt; is lying when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-disinformation-spreads-according-to-chuck-todd-interview-929912/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he didn't get that the Repubs were always lying on his air. How do I know? Because the fourth episode of The Newsroom is all about Repubs openly lying. And that was a non-journalist writing, at least &lt;i&gt;nine years ago.&lt;/i&gt; If Sorkin could figure it out, so could Chuck Todd. He's playing us, badly and we'd be foolish to accept him at face value. " created="Fri, 27 Dec 2019 19:15:21 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/20/fsociety.png"/>

The big question of this episode and the entire series it turns out is &lt;i&gt;Who Is The Real Elliot?&lt;/i&gt; For that I got the same answer Time had for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)&quot;&gt;POTY in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. We're all Elliot, having constructed more agreeable versions of ourselves to share with the world, hiding who we are many levels deep, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.

I imagine many people will dislike the end, the same way they didn't like the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the story is real, some of it matters, but in the end not much actually changed. Mr Robot asks us to look at ourselves and our families and friends, and how much of it is what we wish it were, vs how much is as it actually is. There isn't anything unique in this story, it's really the story of our lives, waking up from the dream we concocted to get through childhood. Endings to stories are hard, the art is in where they leave you and how much they change you, and the ending of Mr Robot scores high on all counts.

She's also calm and reasonable, has worked in Congress, stared down Kavanaugh, and after Trump gets through gutting our government and military, we will want an administrator who is not quite so loud. I've said this before, we need a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/24.html#a143005&quot;&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, not just control of Congress and the presidency. We need a candidate who can soak up as many votes as possible. McConnell has to go. But we can't start putting things back together if there is a McConnell 2.0 to replace him. We also need to pass some constitutional amendments. Otherwise whatever gains we make will be short-lived. Our constitution is getting a stress test now. We will need to start fixing bugs immediately. Voting Rights Act is added to constitution. Gerrymandering is unconstitutional. Impeachment is automatic and begins on Day One. That said, my point of view is switching. If the trial in the Senate leaves Trump in the White House, unconstrained by Congress and knowing it, we're going to need a real campaigner to fight our way out of that hole. We will come to think of this campaign as nothing less than a revolution.  " created="Thu, 19 Dec 2019 15:21:14 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/19/crush.png"/>

I'm guessing the practical reason for this is so that Twitter can no longer be held responsible for abuse. They could ask Trump, for example, to host his own twitter, and people could subscribe to it anywhere, including Jack's twitter. It's basically a return to the open web after 13 years as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo&quot;&gt;silo&lt;/a&gt; that's been sucking the life out of the open web.

Now it's a huge industry with lots at stake and lots of entities that would like to keep it from standardizing.

It's time for a &lt;i&gt;proprietary&lt;/i&gt; approach, one that is open to cloning. That can work because there's a single decision-making entity.

Finally figured it out. I don't like tech companies imposing rules on writers. I may hate what pubs do with their tracking code and paywalls, but I hate what the tech industry is doing to oppose that, more. Maybe if Brave came out of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic&quot;&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; I would like it better, but it came from Silicon Valley, from the former CEO of Mozilla.

As you may know, I broke a rib in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a125931&quot;&gt;bike accident&lt;/a&gt; in September. Mostly healed now. I had to go in for an X-ray and my doctor said there was a shadow that she didn't like. I should go for a CT-scan she said, let's find out what's going on. If it's lung cancer, that's good news, she said, we found it early and it's probably treatable. If we wait for symptoms then it's often not treatable. I smoked for 31 years, she reminded me, in case I was feeling sorry for myself. Heh. So I scheduled the test, had a couple of weeks to think about it. I was obsessed. Maybe she knows and isn't saying until she's absolutely sure. I was convinced that was it, and my life was about to change to the life of a cancer patient. I know a little about it because like pretty much everyone I know people who have cancer. My father died from it. Anyway, no cancer. Knock wood. But I had the benefit of &lt;i&gt;thinking&lt;/i&gt; I had it. So I got that experience, without the awful chemo and radiation and possible dying. I feel very lucky. I decided to tell this story now to give you an idea why I don't care that Chrome hates my websites. I do what my doctor says, mostly -- I don't give a shit what Google wants me to do.

				<outline text="We had a good size winter storm at my country house in the last couple of days. It's the kind of storm that's mostly wet in NYC, where I lived previously, but up here it was first heavy snow, then it got lighter. So the first time I shoveled the walkway to the car it was heavy lifting and the second time, light and easy. Perhaps 1.5 feet of snow. I drove down the road before it was plowed, having an AWD is great, and noted that someone had been cross country skiing on my road, I was envious. I took note of where the tracks came from, and went. The air is cold and clear, it feels like one of those mornings in Utah, it's the best first moment of a day anywhere.
