He doesn't want anyone to blame them, though they will certainly get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing&quot;&gt;doxed&lt;/a&gt; or worse. The Dems most definitely did make their case, because they were thorough and courageous, and because the president made little effort to cover his tracks.

If we don't remove him, assume he'll do more of that. And so will future presidents. We could throw out the Constitution. The presidency would be a for-profit enterprise, with the president selling favors to foreign leaders in return for favors and money. Could he do similar deals with the head of the FBI and DOJ? Why not? Would you pay taxes to such a government? Why? The Constitution would no longer have any force. Congress no longer serves as an oversight on the executive, you could all go home, or maybe you would blackmail local officials, of course kicking up a taste to President Trump (or whoever). You say we should acquit Trump. So this new form of government is okay with you? And if it's not (we hope) what should we do?

Every time I have to do that work I project evil thoughts at the person who did this. I understand there's supposed to be a way around it, a way to grab the keystroke back from Electron, but I spent a half-day not getting it to work. I don't have that many half-days to throw away.

The hottest place in the US is always &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/weather-and-climate.htm&quot;&gt;Death Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Every day. So when they report the highest temperature on weather reports, they're telling you the place with the second highest temperature because it would just get boring to always say Death Valley. I think that may be how it works for TV series. Fargo is the best, hands down, nothing compares. It's incredibly funny the way Quentin Taratino movies are, or Itchy and Scratchy, it's filled with Easter eggs, and until you watch it twice (at least) you won't see the connections between the characters. For example, in Season 1, two of the main characters were also in Season 2, but it took place 25 years earlier. And there are echoes of the Fargo movie. So I often say The Wire is the best.

Neither will get done what they say they will, that will require team-building skills which neither have, and compromise, which means you have to listen. Even Obama, a relatively young person, was totally unprepared to deal with foreign hacking of our election. There's a reason Bernie doesn't have any apps on his phone.

One day on the train, I remember this really clearly, I was watching all the houses and apartment buildings we passed, first in Queens, then in the Bronx. Inside every window, I guessed, was a family, like my own, possibly. With their dramas and struggles, stories, victories, history, abuse, happiness, fear. I tried to imagine how each of them might live and realized in an overwhelming way that I could never begin to understand who they were. NYC, even then, was an ethnically and economically diverse place. Of course as we traveled through the city, the people on the train changed too. Very few of them were Bronx Science students. There were all kinds of people. Who knew what any of them were thinking. The point is this. The world is huge. To keep our sanity we have to simplify it, and to do that we have to ignore differences. The stories we tell ourselves little connection to reality. And so any general statement about a community as huge and diverse as Facebook is certain to miss the mark, widely. And most of what we read only focuses on the company, not the users. To have that appear as journalism is just wrong because journalism has a higher calling, to find out what's real, what's true, and then say that.

I'd like to see a few journalists adopt the point of view that Facebook is not a simple place, can't be reduced to  good or evil, isn't a product of one or two peoples' personalities, that it's made up of an incomprehensibly huge group of people, from everywhere.

The moral of the story is this. Come on Facebook, re-join the open web. Let's make it easy for people to do their writing outside Facebook for sharing inside. Let's make the wall of your silo so permeable that it ceases to be a silo. On Twitter I was asked why I keep beating this drum when it seems so unlikely that Facebook cares. I do it because I want to create a historic record, this has always been a big part of my blogging. I want to remember what sharing across silo walls was like in 2020. Maybe we'll look back and marvel that it was once this convoluted. Or maybe we'll marvel that it could be done at all. No one knows. But part of the reason I blog is to create a record. That's why I care so much about &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;bigco's&lt;/a&gt; trying to erase that record for selfish reasons.

It's nice that he still reads my blog, even though I have said some critical things about Medium, but all in the spirit of trying to make the web work better. Hope they have been received that way. I learned from reading his post that he has moved to New York. I think that's a good move, from San Francisco, which as a born-and-bred NYer has always seemed really small to me. Of course I've now moved to a much much smaller place. Anyway Ev if you're reading this, thanks for the kind words. :rocket:" created="Tue, 07 Jan 2020 15:32:06 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="A lot of people I knew years ago who have gone on to great success are keeping their distance. I wish they wouldn't. I have had my own experience with success, having been part of a tech IPO in the 80s, and creating a bunch of the tech in the 90s and 00s that we take for granted today. Some people may think I'm poor. I am not. The stock and real estate markets have made it pretty easy to build on a modest nest egg. But our humanity is so much more important than the ways we measure success and influence. Ultimately, no matter how rich any of us are, we don't really attain the influence we feel we deserve. I've learned that from burying two parents, both of whom had very strong opinions. Today, years after they are gone, well, no one really cares about what they thought. I care about them as my parents, the people who raised and cared for me, and I care about their struggles and accomplishments insofar as it was central to who they were. But their influence now is nil, and sadly, it was probably pretty close to that when they were alive. That's reality. So if we enjoyed each others' company before, if we learned from each other in the past, your great success shouldn't matter, it shouldn't be a barrier to more fun.

Ridiculous. NYC has 8.6 million people. It has art museums, libraries, great restaurants, office buildings, millions of homes and families to go with them. Two baseball stadiums. Two airports. Dozens of schools and universities. It's a big place but Facebook is much much much bigger. Let's say Facebook has a billion users. That means it's 125 times the size of NYC. The people who go to Facebook are not low-lifers, they're your friends and family, colleagues, classmates, people in power, retired people, rich and poor, from every continent. What is happening on Facebook? Does anyone have the slightest idea? Even the Facebook company probably only has a very aggregated view of what goes on there.

					<outline text="I have a hunch that Facebook is where journalism is rebooting.

					<outline text="Professional journalism does not respect online. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/social-media-2020.html&quot;&gt;Farhad Manjoo's latest&lt;/a&gt;. What a trip. Some of my friends in Woodstock don't use Facebook for the reasons he outlines. Why? Because they heard it from him, or another NYT reporter or columnist, and believed it. My friends didn't find this out themselves, because if they looked, asked for pointers from friends (for example me), they would have found their people there. If they hang out with evil people, that's probably what they'd find. Or if they live with aging hippies (as in the place I live now) then that's what they'd find. Billions of people can't all be as bad and stupid as a columnist in the NYT says they are. And remember that Manjoo has reasons to want you not to like Facebook. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something&quot;&gt;salary&lt;/a&gt; depends on it. :smile:" created="Fri, 03 Jan 2020 21:55:20 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Journalism has some people believing that there's nothing good about online. That they should stay away from Facebook. It's not safe. But it's where people go now. Billions. I'm not happy about that, but it is what it is. Saying online is dangerous is like saying the subway is dangerous. But if you live in New York, you probably want to take the subway. Driving is dangerous. Everything is. Life itself isn't safe. It's a mix. You have to learn to discern. But most people are good, and most people are on Facebook. And it pisses me off that a few of my neighbors won't use Facebook, and when I ask why, they repeat the talking points of the journalists, almost verbatim. We perceive the world of today as being more dangerous than the world we grew up in. In fact, today's world is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/14/theres-never-been-a-safer-time-to-be-a-kid-in-america/?noredirect=on&quot;&gt;much safer&lt;/a&gt;.
