It shouldnâ€™t be for personal sites.&quot; There's a bigger picture. Google shouldn't try to take control of HTTP. As I say in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Google is a guest on the web, as we all are. Guests don't make the rules. There are good reasons to keep HTTP simple. None of us have the right to change it. It is what it is. Scripting News will never be forced to do anything by Google, I don't recognize their authority to force anyone to do anything on the web. If HTTPS is such a great idea, there would be no reason to force anyone to do it, we'd do it because we want to. &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;More here&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="This came up in a Twitter conversation with Miguel de Icaza, earlier today, mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/28.html#a140541&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;. I said that Sanders and Warren freak me out. Warren is his candidate, so he asked why. I said I didn't want to discuss it on Twitter. After giving it a few hours thought I decided to try it on my blog, here, now. " created="Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:59:32 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true">
						<outline text="As a man when I see another man cornered, in public, on a #metoo issue, I know that he has very little room to respond. There isn't much you can say. And it is almost as uncomfortable for other men watching it. When men get together in a #metoo charged environment, we talk with each other about how scared we are that we will be wrongly accused, precisely because there is nothing you can do or say. The classic example is Al Franken. It came out later, as was pretty obvious to me at the time, that the woman he supposedly abused was part of the play. Franken is a genuinely good person, and if he can be taken down by this, so easily, without any process, anyone can. " created="Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:47:46 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/07/elizabethWarrenActionFigure.png"/>
						<outline text="If you think about it, Warren and her team had a problem to solve after a previous debate where she was almost silent. She needed to make a splash in this debate. They probably had a list of options, probably even focus group tested them, to see which would get the most attention, and she almost certainly planned and rehearsed how she would do it, and how she would react to various Bloomberg responses. That's #metoo being used as a political tool. Very calculating. And it worked, how well it worked, we'll find out on Tuesday. " created="Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:47:54 GMT"/>
						<outline text="But there's a third paragraph to this. It's true that men can't respond in public, but we can express our anger privately -- with our vote. I can vote for anyone I like. And in my gut I believe this is why Democrats do poorly with men. Democrats push this button too easily. Watching Bloomberg on stage, taking it, with no way to respond that preserves his dignity, that makes me angry. For me, it isn't enough to cause me to vote against the Democratic candidate, even if it was Warren. But I believe we lose because many men are &lt;i&gt;justifiably&lt;/i&gt; angry at the Democrats and can't express that anger publicly. So they do it privately, by voting for Republicans." created="Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:50:05 GMT"/>

					<outline text="It seems Sanders will rule MSNBC the way Trump rules Fox; if so -- I'm going to CNN, which I did last night. It was a good choice because I got to see the Bloomberg town hall, which was excellent. If he's not really a sweet smart guy,  then he's a great actor who plays one, and I don't think he's an actor. If you get a chance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2020/02/full-video-cnn-south-carolina-town-hall-with-bloomberg-biden-klobuchar-and-warren-feb-26/&quot;&gt;watch it&lt;/a&gt;, if for no other reason to observe how bad the debate format is about informing our choices." created="Thu, 27 Feb 2020 15:43:06 GMT"/>

					<outline text="In the debates and the town hall, Bloomberg misses obvious opportunities most politicians wouldn't miss. When someone greets you with a smile, smile back and when their question is done, no matter how pointed, say &quot;That's a really good question.&quot; Bloomberg doesn't. These are easy things to learn, and they go a long way toward being likable, trusted, and perceived as authentic.

					<outline text="In the final question of the debate they asked a softball question that he muffed. What's the biggest misperception about you?

					<outline text="On the other hand, in last night's town hall, he was open and vulnerable, explained himself, and I got the feeling over and over, this is my ideal of a president. I don't want someone who blows smoke and points fingers, I want someone who works at making things better, and protects us, listens and is open-minded. He has done all that both in his civic and private life, and he's made mistakes which have been pointed out, and unlike many leaders, esp the current president, and other candidates, he admits when he was wrong.

This is what no one wants to talk about. Even MSNBC is switching away from it. Our last chance imho is to create a new Democratic Party where the only thing we all have in common is we believe in the rule of law. Until we can reboot our democracy, create Marshall Plan for ourselves, &lt;i&gt;and do it quickly, &lt;/i&gt;with every hand on deck, we're going to where India is now. We are probably the last hope. So no it doesn't matter what anyone said 10 years ago, it doesn't even matter what they said yesterday. What matters is that we create a big enough a movement now to be noticed when the government shuts it down. As I said earlier, things are so bad now that Trump might not even have to cheat to win. And then we are lost. Far more lost than we are now. We don't want to look at this, I get it, but we have to. We have to support each other, not fear each other. We might not have another chance, but if we're going to survive we can't keep going the way we're going.

I answered it. It was a rep from Verizon wanting to know if we wanted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Fios&quot;&gt;FIOS&lt;/a&gt;. I said yes! Yes! We do! So I signed them up. Went back to the kitchen and we realized how weird it was, after many years of putting up with shitty DSL, just after he dies, all of a sudden there's the FIOS guy. We figured that it was probably the first thing Dad took care of when he got to the afterlife, order FIOS for the house. He would have loved it. My dad was a real internet activist. I often wonder what he would think of American politics of 2020. I know he would have hated Trump. But Sanders? I don't know. He really liked Hillary Clinton, and as far as he was concerned Israel could do no wrong. His first born son (me) did not agree with all of that, though he might have been surprised that I came around to HRC in 2016.

				<outline text="The last few days there's been a change on MSNBC. The only show I regularly watch, Ari Melber, has opened the last two shows with a recital of the number of delegates each of the candidate has. I'm sure Sanders supporters hear that as good news, but I hear a lecture, get with the program dear MSNBC user, this is where we, and you, are going. I suppose after Super Tuesday this might be inevitable, but it isn't yet. Anyway, no matter, I'm not going along for the ride. I think we're deep in fascist shit in this country, and there's no sign of us digging out. I don't like Sanders. He yells slogans, and every attempt to get him to talk about his ideas in any detail just gets more slogans. I can't read his mind, but all evidence says he's as shallow as Trump. I wouldn't worry about death camps with Sanders (as I do with Trump), but I also think there's a very good chance we lose with him. Even with a perfect candidate it's a long shot because Trump is cheating. But with Sanders, he might not have to. So count me out, I'm not going along for this ride. I'll put my time between six and seven every night to better use. " created="Wed, 26 Feb 2020 14:28:58 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/26/sanders.png"/>

				<outline text="Since socialism is going to be a big &quot;issue&quot; for the foreseeable future, let me offer two pieces I wrote on the subject. First, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/01/theWorldIsSocialist.html&quot;&gt;The world is socialist&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. &quot;Ayn Rand's philosophy might have worked in an agrarian society when people lived far apart, and couldn't pool their resources. When there wasn't much technology, so there wasn't much point in trying to fight disease or keep the trains running, because there was no medicine or trains.&quot; And &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/08/theWorldIsSocialistPartIi.html&quot;&gt;Health care is socialist&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. &quot;We don't know who will get sick, or when. So rather than take a risk that you'll be the one who gets the expensive disease, we pool our resources to pay a share of what the treatment would cost each year.&quot; I put &quot;issue&quot; in quotes because it isn't a real issue. Everything is socialist, it has to be, there is no other way. So it's redundant to say someone is a socialist. We all are.

I went to a lot of Dead shows, going back to the early 70s, on both coasts and in Madison, but never considered myself a Deadhead. I liked a lot of other bands. But I keep coming back to the Dead. Their songs are anthems for my life and work. I think we should play &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdPOAhBp2Ag&quot;&gt;US Blues&lt;/a&gt; at baseball games and Fourth of July picnics. That's the America I come from.

Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, John Anderson, Barack Obama. All these candidates had Sanders-like pitches. I'm transformative, they said. When I am president, everything will change. Problem is if they actually believe it and are elected, they and we are fucked. They turn out most definitely not to be transformative. The United States is a huge ship and it takes a lot of compromise and time to get it to turn. Giridharadas points out that Sanders is the son of a Holocaust survivor, well, so am I, and I don't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass&quot;&gt;Hail Mary passes&lt;/a&gt; unless that's the only option left. This is not a normal election, and Sanders is way too risky. We need to get solidly off the path we're on, bringing as many people as possible along with us. Then let's go for a Sanders-like candidate, maybe when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; is old enough to run for president.

The problem is that none of the JavaScript key handlers (that I've found so far) will decode an existing event, they have to actually capture the event itself and call back to the app. Maybe there's an exception. If such a toolkit exists, that would make the systematization of Concord's keystroke handling simple enough to attempt.

						<outline text="Another conclusion -- imagine a happy ending, and write the history of it, from 20-30 years out. Here's what I would write. 2020 was a pivotal election. The Democratic Party and the remnants of the Republican Party that still believed in the Constitution formed a bond, and elected a transitional president, Michael Bloomberg, a former Republican, technocrat, oligarch. This marginalized the extreme part of the Republican Party that was loyal to Trump. The Democrats won the presidency and Congress with huge margins, enough to codify the norms that Trump violated. After the election, the two groups went their own ways, forming two new parties, one liberal and one conservative, and the country evolved out of the insane partisanship of the 90s, 00s and 10s.

It was a passionate wakeup call that apparently rippled out to Pierce's perch in the hierarchy of punditry, who hears it as the question he asks. Why is Carville relevant, he asks. Better question, why is Pierce such an idiot? It doesn't matter who sees the truth and yells it loud enough to pierce the fog of your self-importance, what matters is that &lt;i&gt;it's the truth. &lt;/i&gt;We are, as Carville says, on our way to electing Trump to another term, when what we need to do is win so decisively that we have the power to undo the damage he did.

I know just a two-minute difference, but I'm a perfectionist, and the two minutes really bothered me. Also it's more reliable, which is the real reason I did the work.

You toggle the feature with Cmd-\. Like everything in an outline, it's hierarchic, so when you comment a headline, it and all its subs are commented. Okay so now what does it mean to be commented? It depends on who processes the outline. The idea originated in programming, when you want to explain a bit of code, you'd tell the code interpreter the writing by &quot;commenting it out.&quot; Comments are like speaker notes for code. That was the long answer. The short one is that, for what you're doing now, it probably doesn't matter if some text is commented or not. It'll happen if you press Cmd-\ by accident.

A rough idea of how it would work. The user signs on to their Amazon account, the one they use to buy socks, and then authorizes you to act on its behalf with AWS. Ideally that would feel, to the user, like giving access to an app to use their Twitter identity. From there, you create a pair of S3 buckets, one private and one public. Then you allow my software to access his bucket. I don't know what all these steps are. But it should draw on a user's ability to create accounts on other popular services. I imagine it's what Amazon itself would create if they wanted to provide a service to non-developers.

						<outline text="There was another probably more important story last night, where real news had been made during the day. The obsession of the previous week -- impeachment.

						<outline text="On MSNBC there was a party atmosphere. As if finally we don't have to talk about doom and gloom, for a few minutes we can go back to the naivete of the 2016 election when we could laugh about Trump. Or who knows what they thought was so funny. The news, which ostensibly is their business, is as funny as a heart attack during a nuclear holocaust. Having a party on TV now would be like laughing as the world was mourning Kobe Bryant. Look, CNN and MSNBC should be news rooms. If you don't know what that means, either get out of the way, or learn. Your job is to always be asking yourself Is This Actually News? Last night they had nothing. And they acted like idiots.

The horserace provides good TV, I guess, if what you want to do is play video games during the broadcast (that's what I do), but we've got other more pressing business than the minutia that people think of as news in this period. It's in the boredom of the interminably long election that Hillary's Emails were invented. We would never have had time for Hunter Biden and Burisma. The length of the process is something the Repubs have mastered for their mischief. Let's not give them such a tempting target. First primary is in July, say, and it's five huge swing states. Then the rest. That's it. Then a convention and Election Day. " created="Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:57:27 GMT" type="outline"/>

When they sued the guy who claimed to have invented podcasting, they didn't respond to my emails or blog posts begging them not to take the approach they took. I felt it's important to get on the record how media types like podcasting come about. They didn't care. So much for being on the electronic frontier. It seems to me we should be on the same side in everything, and when we're not we should listen to each other. I gave the EFF $5K, which was then and is now a lot of money for me, when they were founded by Mitch Kapor, John Gilmor and John Perry Barlow, in 1990.

When you're being bullied by someone so obviously vulnerable, give it back to him. It's even &lt;s&gt;worse&lt;/s&gt; better when a woman says a man is a liar, bald, fat, and wears makeup.
