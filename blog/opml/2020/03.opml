				<outline text="My NYC correspondent. &quot;I was already cautiously optimistic that the virus is milder than we realize, because of the testing bias towards very ill patients. Now there's evidence that may be true, from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-28/dutch-hospital-workers-show-insidious-nature-of-coronavirus&quot;&gt;Dutch study&lt;/a&gt; that would not only explain why it spreads so well, but is an argument for why 100% of the population should wear masks in public, and why we should exhaustively test healthy people as well. The more people who have already been infected with sub-clinical or no symptoms, the lower and sooner the peak will be, at least here in NYC where it's already likely to sweep the population.&quot;" created="Tue, 31 Mar 2020 17:02:02 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/31/kentBrockman.png"/>

					<outline text="Usually I get groceries once a week, and there's nothing surprising about it, certainly nothing that's blogworthy. Today it's different. It was time to go, and I dreaded it. But I had a mask, and they have sanitizing wipes at the front door, and I had read all about how to do it safely, so I went. A few notes.

						<outline text="The store wasn't empty, but it wasn't very full either. People were cheerful, as they often are in the country.

						<outline text="I got almost everything I wanted, and more. It's still an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World&quot;&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; supermarket.

" created="Tue, 31 Mar 2020 15:32:20 GMT"/>
						<outline text="And to my surprise they had wipes! I got the last two packages. And they have a limit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/31/announcement.png&quot;&gt;two per customer&lt;/a&gt;.

I desperately have wanted to have some of the basic sanitizing supplies at home. Now I do. And I love that they have the daily limit of two per customer. I heard about people hoarding, coming back to the store three times a day to swipe up all the paper goods and cleaners. " created="Tue, 31 Mar 2020 15:33:27 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The checkout station was revamped. There's a red line that keeps you from getting to close to the checkout person. There's a plastic shield separating the customer and the clerk. They don't pack your cloth bags, but they're happy to use their paper bags, which they're now giving out for free after a few months of getting us to switch over.

This is bad, but I think by June NYC is going to be the most resilient and functional city, with experience and infrastructure and also lots of people who are resistant because they've already gotten it.

				<outline text="Dev work: A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/24.html#a204119&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; how to use regex to mash up paths for web requests. In the end I went another way, adding a long-wanted plug-in capability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt;, my labor-of-love Node-based web server. I found a really Nodey way to do it, much better imho than using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_vm.asp&quot;&gt;vm&lt;/a&gt;.

A lot of people don't know they can be in files, not just distributed through NPM. It's a really nice way to do plug-ins, and it's made something cool possible with Little Outliner. More on that later. In the meantime I've written up the use of modules as PagePark plug-ins in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/158#issuecomment-605650163&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about regex.&lt;i&gt; Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;" created="Sun, 29 Mar 2020 15:03:09 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/29/beavis.png"/>

They're not understanding what's going to be left when this is done. Saving corporations is not a possibility. We should be focused on surviving as people and a country. In Katrina people had somewhere to evacuate to. This time we don't. On the other hand nothing we made need be destroyed. It should mostly be here when we emerge. I suppose pirates could hijack airplanes, or occupy skyscrapers in Manhattan. A question I learned to ask from New Orleans. Who's going to supply the supply chain? They had trouble rebuilding because there was no place for the builders to sleep, and no food for them to eat, and no one to prepare it because they had nowhere to live. We need really smart people there thinking and planning. Yet this is the fog of war. We have very little data on the enemy.

						<outline text="Moderation - Cannabis interacts with your body's endocannabinoid system, which the body uses to regulate physiological function- from immune response to memory. Regular high-dose use reduces the density of your endocannabinoid receptors. That's a really poor choice at the moment. Three days of abstinence can restore a significant part of that lost receptor density. Good time to consider a short break. Trust me, cannabis will be there when you get back." created="Sun, 22 Mar 2020 21:09:10 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Find your MED - MED stands for minimum effective dose. There are still folks that think that huge doses of cannabis are a demonstration of their expertise. Sorry, Cheech. The cool folks know that massive doses quickly lead to the disappearance of the subtlest and most interesting effects of cannabis. Find the smallest MED that moves your needle and stick with it." created="Sun, 22 Mar 2020 21:09:14 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Freeze your stash - Cannabis is more than its THC or CBD content. Cannabis flower is perishable and room temperatures degrade its essential oil content. Freeze and just take what you're going to consume. Make sure the freezer container is airtight (I recommend mason jars, as they come in many sizes and are non-reactive with cannabis.)" created="Sun, 22 Mar 2020 21:09:17 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Inhale with care - Cannabis smoke and cannabis concentrates can irritate your lungs and suppress your pulmonary immune function and response. Consider mixing it up by taking cannabis orally or switching to a flower vaporizer. An occasional puff is okay, but only if your lungs are in good shape and you're symptom free. Don't inhale if you have symptoms or have been exposed. Period." created="Sun, 22 Mar 2020 21:09:25 GMT"/>

Of course it's one of the few places where the virus is being fought effectively, the US is a somewhere between a shitshow and a clusterfuck. I wanted to suggested she skip the return to the US and just stay there for the duration. Of course she was thinking about that. She had decided to let fate determine the outcome. If her flight to Seattle wasn't canceled she would return. If not, she'd stay in Seoul, and not try to return through some other hub like Dubai. It's pretty clear now that there aren't going to be many, if any, more flights to the US from South Korea, or anywhere for that matter.

A lot of health care workers in the US either have &quot;Covid-19&quot; or are going to get it soon. When they get it a decision has to be made whether to isolate or not. Of course they should be isolated, not just for our protection, but to get them the rest and care they need. On the other hand, if they are isolated they can't care for non-medical people who are infected. So, there's an exponential curve operating here.

All through my childhood I had terrible anxiety, which manifested in an unhappy digestive system. Always had a stomach ache, trouble controlling my bowels. Upset. I was always upset. I understood why totally, my parents created a very tense atmosphere, and after many years of therapy and self-examination I understood why they were so tense. But a few years after I established myself outside their house the digestive problems magically went away. They're back. Started just after watching Trump's Oval Office speech last Wednesday. I was already hunkered down. I understood what was coming. What was clear from his speech that he didn't. He was still throwing out racist bullshit. From the fucking Oval Office. After that, I realized fully how fucked we are. There have been moments of relaxation. But they're few and far between now. " created="Wed, 18 Mar 2020 14:56:17 GMT" type="outline"/>

At the end I say why. Even I thought it was crazy, delusional. Since then however the story proved true. It's why I write and record my thoughts. I want to remember the perspective of events before, during and after they happen. Listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/11.html#a190333&quot;&gt;James Taylor&lt;/a&gt; talk about his music, the one thing he doesn't mention in the long list of roles music plays in our lives is that it brings old memories to the surface. Listening to his songs takes me back to high school, young love, and the wild random and erratic ideas I had as a teen. Writing isn't as strong a stimulus as music, but it's what I do. And podcasting too of course. Story-telling. So much has happened in the last nine days, every one of the upcoming nine days is no doubt going to be equally consequential.

				<outline text="Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/contagious-crisis/&quot;&gt;must-listen podcast&lt;/a&gt; from Chris Lydon. The take-away is that our political system hasn't yet realized that we need to go to single-payer for all, now, if we want to have as good an outcome as Italy, which is to say a very shitty outcome. Ours is on track to be much worse because the uninsured can't enter the system, therefore will continue to infect even people with insurance. We're set suffer here in the US a lot more. There will be a debate tomorrow night, and if Biden isn't tuned into this, Sanders is going to clean his clock. And I suspect Biden isn't. And there's a chance that Sanders isn't thinking clearly either, but I kind of doubt it. Nothing focuses the mind like losing. Action-item: before the debate, Biden should give a speech outlining a Medicare-for-all-now program. Give Sanders proper credit. At the debate he can offer to delegate the implementation of this to Sanders. Create unity right there on the debate stage. The Democrats in Congress are not without power. Trump is crazy to think the only criteria people will care about is the stock market. People who unnecessarily lose friends and relatives to this disease are likely to care about that more. Never waste a good crisis. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt; is the time to reform health care in the US.
