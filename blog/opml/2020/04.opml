Note the items in the feed have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/feedHasGuidsAsYouCanSee.png&quot;&gt;proper guid elements&lt;/a&gt;, so there should be no need to use the title as a guid, but it seems that Apple's podcast app does, because when I changed the titles of the five most recent episodes, voila -- they show up in the Apple podcasts app. This was suggested on Twitter by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/og/&quot;&gt;OG&lt;/a&gt; podcaster &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bloatedlesbian/status/1255697398485180418&quot;&gt;Madge Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;.

But this could be as profound a transition as the switch to sound in the 1930s (also a depression era).

He's gotta stop doing that (just kidding). As a former entrepreneur, I have a bit of advice myself. Listen to your users. This, surprising to me, has been something journalism explains they don't do, presumably because it would taint their objectivity. They're humans like the rest of us and the reason is probably more that it complicates their already-complicated lives. But the answer to their problems imho lie there. Every user of news will tell you that they aren't going to subscribe to every news org they're interested in. There must be some profitable relationship short of total commitment that will get our money into your bank account. Yet that's exactly how the industry has configured itself, as if every pub has a reasonable shot of being funded this way. Listen to users, followed by a negotiation -- that's where the answer lies. Also change your mission now to saving lives. As I've said before if you save my life I'm going to shower you with money. I'm going to &lt;i&gt;drown&lt;/i&gt; you with money. And it's never been easier to do that, btw. Changing times call for new ideas. " created="Wed, 29 Apr 2020 15:42:24 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="Tuesday morning, still fucking around with Dropbox. These things usually end up costing a week of burnout. One of my servers is a place I leave apps I don't use much, but want to still be able to look at. And one or two that are mainstays. Let's say that server is named Alaska. A long time ago Dropbox stopped working on that machine. That made it hard but not impossible for me to update the apps. I have a utility that helps move files from S3 to folders on Alaska. But the data on Alaska is not backed up. So that's a permanent kind of burnout. There is stuff being generated on this server. It would be bad to lose it. Not being backed up. So now I'm trying to resolve that. " created="Tue, 28 Apr 2020 14:04:53 GMT" type="outline"/>

When the first show aired, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/23.html&quot;&gt;February 23&lt;/a&gt;, there was no awareness of the virus in advertising. As the season progressed, at times I forgot I was watching something from nine weeks ago. An ad for a bank that has turned itself into a coffee shop. Whoa that's optimistic, I thought to myself, and then realized this was the old reality. The full series makes a very interesting window into the transition our culture is making. I'm reminded of when my mom died, we didn't do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/04.html#a070909&quot;&gt;video walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; of the house we grew up in. Didn't think of it, because it seemed normal to be there, not realizing soon this would all be gone, and in the future it would be anything but normal. Now we're repeating it on a much much larger scale. When this show turns up on Netflix it won't have the ads, and we'll miss the transition, which is in every way as interesting as the show, which as I said is fantastic.

				<outline text="I took a survey class in programming languages in grad school, and COBOL was of course one of them. It was in the mid-late 70s when people were still creating new systems in COBOL. It was one of the first attempts to make programming like English instead of like programming, so managers could do it, you wouldn't need programmers. To anyone who really knew about programming, it was obvious that this would not work. People would want features for which there were no human language equivalents, like looping and recursion, nesting, local variables, procedures, closures, objects, async, etc etc. We keep discovering new concepts for which you can't say &quot;this is just like..&quot; COBOL may have been the first programming language to reject programming, but it was not the last. Later attempts include Hypercard and AppleScript. I'm sure there were many others. I've always been most comfortable with Algol-like languages, C, Pascal, JavaScript. My own invented language, UserTalk, is Algol-like. There is a grammar somewhere for UserTalk.

I dream of carrying a can of red spray paint with me, and when someone comes too close with their car and I have to slam on the brakes to avoid getting run over, I whip out the paint and put a red stripe on their fender or bumper. Then they would have to explain to friends and family how they got the red stripe. Shitty drivers would end up with &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of them." created="Wed, 15 Apr 2020 14:17:30 GMT"/>

There was no reason for it, no car on the other side of the double-yellow lines. He was either really sloppy or trying to fuck with me. He pulled over, started coming toward me, and then stopped, presumably when he saw I was much larger than him. The car gives you a sense of size-of-body that isn't realistic.

A non-smoking story at the Bowie concert last week. As I'm walking out I see people lighting up everywhere. Smell of smoke all around. It smells good. I really want one.

Oh hell, just offer $1 to begin with. Whoo, where would I get a match. I'd ask for a light. Take a drag. Estimated time, 15 seconds to one minute to first nicotine rush.

Let's try again. When Gov Cuomo says that NY got hit first, I want to know why other American cities didn't get hit at roughly the same time. They say a virus moves in waves. First northern Italy gets it, then the south. NY has its hospitals overloaded, but not Philadelphia. The theory is, according to Cuomo, that the virus will peak in NY, and then peak in other places. Since people move freely around the US, why wouldn't it all happen at roughly the same time. I'd like you to remember, before answering, I have a math degree, and have spent decades working with logic and numbers in computer software. Saying that Dallas has cases, as has St Louis and Cleveland, while true, is not an answer to this puzzling question. Thanks in advance for considering this.

Our brain tries to understand the predicament. Not the intellectual brain, the instinctive one. The subconscious. The child. The one that decides in an instant to fight or flight. The one that keeps your organs functioning, oversees the immune system's response to an invader. It's very powerful, but its vision is limited to the input coming in through your senses. It's not very well wired up to your conscious self, the intellect. Something is threatening you, it can detect that, but it doesn't understand what it is. So it makes you numb while it tries to figure it out. But it never can. So you feel depressed.

It's now possible to view user-editable files through PagePark as long as they've been made public. This is how the pieces fit together. " created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:22:27 GMT">
						<outline text="&quot;PagePark&quot; is a Node-based HTTP server that has special understanding of two kinds of files -- &quot;Markdown&quot; and &quot;OPML&quot;. " created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:23:09 GMT">
							<outline text="For Markdown files, it renders them in a template. So you don't have to repeat the envelope for each bit of text, and it's easy to modify, for all pages. So it's a bit of a CMS for Markdown files. It also can connect directly to GitHub repos, so it can serve from them, which is nice because Markdown is a default format on GitHub. " created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:23:52 GMT"/>
							<outline text="PagePark also has a special ability to render &quot;OPML&quot; files. I use this feature for my this.how site which I've been using to accumulate documents that I want to revise over time. Unlike blog posts, they are not ephemeral. Examples include my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;Trolling howto&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt; doc. " created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:24:15 GMT"/>
							<outline text="So to sum up, what's special about PagePark, for this situation, is that it's really good at rendering OPML documents." created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:26:41 GMT"/>

						<outline text="&quot;Little Outliner&quot; is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outline editor&lt;/a&gt; that runs in a web browser. Its native format is &quot;OPML&quot;. " created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:32:06 GMT">
							<outline text="Every file you edit with &quot;LO2&quot; is either public or private. " created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:33:18 GMT"/>
							<outline text="I have a copy of PagePark running on the same machine as the server that runs Little Outliner. I created a bridge between the two apps, on the server, that allows PagePark to serve from each users' public folder. When you access the page, you'll see a beautifully rendered version, like my this.how documents. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.this.how/davewiner/example.opml&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:33:54 GMT"/>
							<outline text="This might sound complicated, because you've probably never thought of the software that runs these apps. But conceptually it's simple. There's a new bridge between &quot;LO2&quot; and &quot;PagePark&quot;. That bridge is a PagePark plug-in." created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:34:55 GMT"/>
							<outline text="I've been talking about the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md&quot;&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt; ability for PagePark. I needed that to create this connection. I've designed a lot of plug-in architectures over many years, and this is a good one. All web servers running in JavaScript should consider doing it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md#a-plug-in-is-a-module&quot;&gt;this way&lt;/a&gt;. The plug-in I use for this bridge, is a bit of logic that translates a URL from the outside, to a file in the user's public folder. I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/a676b0da36c13576877a91fc77a34ecb&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the source. As you can see, there's not much there.

						<outline text="To really nail it, it turns this &lt;a href=&quot;http://storage2.littleoutliner.com/users/davewiner/myOutlines/example.opml&quot;&gt;source file&lt;/a&gt; into this &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.this.how/davewiner/example.opml&quot;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;. That's it. The next step, soon, will be to present a document that explains how to edit and view these files through the new bridge.

I found the page where you apply for it, read the instructions, watched the video and thought this is going to be a breeze. I do this kind of stuff all the time. So I started to set up an account. They ask for your SSN, date of birth, address, phone, email address. I entered them all. It said no, you didn't do it right, go back and do it again. No indication which part they didn't like. So I tweaked my address. Still it doesn't like it. So I took out my middle initial, thinking my father, when he set up this account for me in 1957 or so might have left this out. They said no, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/01/errorMessage.png&quot;&gt;that's it&lt;/a&gt; for 24 hours. You can't keep doing this the message said. I guess they figured I was trying to hijack my account? So I tried calling the number they gave for assistance. Oy. I got every piece of information they think I might be looking for. It's pretty grim stuff. I left a callback number. " created="Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:28:54 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/01/grandpa.png"/>
