One thing Comey did right is keep Trump's requests away from the FBI agents doing the investigation. He didn't want Trump to influence them, and he didn't want them picking up any signals from him either. You can say you have nothing to say, but actually saying nothing is far more powerful. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a030528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a120530"></a>BTW, there's no doubt Pence is implicated along w Trump, as is Ryan. We don't have any good options, and they're narrowing all the time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a120530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a120548"></a>BTW, Trump is much worse than Watergate. No Russian spies partied in Oval with Nixon. He was paranoid, not naive.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a120548" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a110506"></a>He goes back to the office and writes it up as all cops do. (Note: Comey is a cop.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a110506" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110520"></a>Comey doesn't know if the threat is credible, but if it turns out that it is, he has his guy nailed. The top guy. No need to give anyone immunity. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a110520" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a110512"></a>Can you imagine a TV cop resigning just because he caught the perp in the act? That would make no sense. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a110512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110549"></a>If Trump was kidding, Comey keeps his job and has no cause to prosecute Trump. But if he makes good on the threat, it's all over. When I <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/864663465478299649">said</a> yesterday that Comey set him up, this is what I meant. He must have known Trump would eventually, in an impulse, fire him. He probably was aware of that when he testified before Congress, just before he was fired. It's possible what he said, even the wording, was designed to make Trump blow his top. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a110549" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110517"></a>And Trump even confessed on TV! It's unbelievable how fucked he is. That's at least partially because Comey is good at his job. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a110517" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110547"></a>PS: It's so clean, Comey doesn't even have to recuse. He's a private citizen. Free to testify. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a110547" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110514"></a>PPS: It seems Trump must have overlooked the fact that he was trying to bribe a cop.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/17.html#a110514" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
