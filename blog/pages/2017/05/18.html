<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a100552"></a>In April I was <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/04/14/journalismAndTheBraintrust.html">writing</a> about journalism and the braintrust. The braintrust is an important often overlooked idea. You have gathered a lot of brains around you. Do you trust them?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/18.html#a100552" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a090500"></a>This is a test. For the next sixty seconds this station will conduct a test of the emergency broadcast system. Had this been an actual emergency you would have been instructed to tune to a local station for news and other information. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/18.html#a090500" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Oh yeah. I know all about it. And corporations. The press is totally complicit. Their idea of credibility is how much money you have. So you become a billionaire and now, the story goes, you're smarter than everyone else. What if a person, <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html">wisely</a>, doesn't organize their creativity solely for the purpose of becoming obscenely rich? Is there any way to win? It would be great if journalism, becoming aware of this, works to change the culture. Look for good ideas that come from non-super-rich.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/18.html#a090546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a080535"></a>New version of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> delivered. New <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/davereader">NPM package</a> contains the core of River5 which can be used in other apps. I converted my rssToSlack app (not released) to use the davereader engine. All seems to work.
