<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a110538"></a>I visited in Seattle this weekend with Paul Andrews, the now-retired <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjclYv1tYvUAhUhwYMKHVizAhUQPAgD#safe=off&hl=en&q=paul+andrews+site:seattletimes.com">tech reporter</a> for the Seattle Times. In the 90s, we talked a lot about Microsoft's efforts to eat the web, which were prodigious, futile and more than a little evil. Paul is what I think of as a no-bullshit reporter. He asks the question that's obvious that most reporters either don't think of or don't have the guts to ask. Really aren't many of them. I want Paul to get back in the saddle, with a blog. I was very clear and open with that wish as people who know me surely must understand by now. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/25.html#a110538" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Can't wait for next episode.
