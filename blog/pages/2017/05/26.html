If you set the type of a node to markdown, when it&#39;s rendered, either on a page, or in a feed, the text is passed through a Markdown renderer. I&#39;m using <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">marked</a>. It&#39;s got a very nice ability to override renderer options. I was able to catch the rendering for a paragraph and not return the HTML markup for paragraphs because in this context it&#39;s redundant.</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/26.html#a120515" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a120512"></a>I view a domain name as a very inexpensive commodity. I think of a domain name as if it were a file name. No more significant. So I have lots of them. And I'm creating more, because this model works, is rational and follows the grain of the web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/26.html#a120512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100552"></a><span class="spRenderedMarkdown">It&#39;s interesting because while the web companies do lots of buildings <em>inside</em> domains, I see the whole Internet namespace as an interesting object to play with. </span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/26.html#a100552" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

It's also just an OPML file in my Dropbox folder. You can't get to it through Dropbox, but you can most definitely get to it through the web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/26.html#a010506" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
