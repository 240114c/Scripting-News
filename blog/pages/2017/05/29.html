<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a080552"></a>BTW, to people who follow <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in a feed reader, you may notice problems with some of the items, like the one you're reading now. In the new scheme, there will be posts that don't have titles. They're like tweets. Some of them <i>are</i> tweets. Not this one because it has more than 140 chars. Anyway, there will be items without titles. If you have questions, please post an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues">issue</a> on the Scripting News repo on GitHub. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a080552" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a120547"></a>It's the Old School approach that I <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">wrote about</a> at the beginning of May. It's taken me most of the month to make the new software. I did it carefully and slowly. With a lot of attention to detail, especially stuff that's not visible.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a120547" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120549"></a>There still are loose-ends to clean up. Changes that couldn't be made until the new site was in place. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a120549" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120516"></a>There will be breakage. For example the <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> now has many titleless items in it. The new blogging system encourages that. Never should have moved away from that when Twitter came about. Now we're undoing that mistake.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a120516" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a110525"></a>If I give a variable a short name or all lowercase, then you can bet it's very local. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a110525" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110538"></a>I thought I had stopped doing this, it came up in one of my talks with Brent last week, but I do still do it.

		<li><a name="a110513"></a>For example, a string that just appears in a calculation to save time or space, or to make the code more debuggable (I can examine an intermediate value more easily) will probably be called <i>s</i>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a110513" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110553"></a>A parameter to a callback routine that's used once in the first line of the callback might also be called <i>s, jsontext</i> or <i>htmltext</i>. If it was going to be used throughout the callback, or after a few lines of code, it would get a longer or more descriptive name. Probably would still be all lowercase though.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a110553" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110516"></a>If it's a local declared at the top of a complex function, it would get a camelCase name, to signal to the reader that it's more important, and also to make it possible to search for it. A variable named <i>s</i> would be problematic because there might be more than one in different scopes, not the same variable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a110516" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

If we know our president thinks and acts like a Russian, we can't overlook that even if it isn't a crime. Think about the criteria you would use when deciding to fire or break up with someone. They don't have to have committed a crime for you to do either. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a100551" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100539"></a>Another thought. Political groups and businesses use positioning to divide us into segments. Sometimes this is relatively harmless, as in positioning a product as appealing to <a href="https://www.secret.com/en-us">women</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcGhLcVqxf0">upper middle class</a> people. But when it segments us on racial lines, or appeals to hate, then it is something to call out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a100539" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110514"></a>A great example was the Wonder Woman movie. The promoters <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2017/05/26/theater-decimates-facebook-critics-ladies-wonder-woman-screening/#.tnw_XcYQszSG">used</a> gender division to promote their product. It worked. And they left us with a wound and one more political division to deal with. It's always a good idea to put your circumstance, race, age, gender etc aside when deciding if a cause is worth supporting. It ought to matter a lot if there'e a for-profit product in the middle of the pitch.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/29.html#a110514" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
