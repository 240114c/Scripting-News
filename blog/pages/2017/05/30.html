Not sure. But these days I probably get as much value from the NYT as I would from the Washington Post. There are a couple of other pubs I'd subscribe to if the price were more reasonable, considering I only exceed their quota of free stories by about the middle of the month. The New Yorker is one for sure. And there are free-to-read pubs that deserve some of the money too, like <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog">TPM</a> and <a href="http://nymag.com/author/Jonathan%20Chait/">New York Mag</a>. It's not fair that I pay the NYT and not them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a040543" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040523"></a>But I'm not ready to create multiple pay-to-read accounts. I want a system.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a040523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040513"></a>So how about forming a trust of some kind, and I pay money to it and that creates a allocates a certain number of reads for me per week across all participating publications. And the money is distributed at the end of the month according to how many articles I read on each site. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a040513" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040514"></a>Maybe they should even give me credits for any reads that come from links I distribute?

		<li><a name="a110522"></a>At the same time I was working on a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">new version</a> of <a href="http://scripting.com/">my blog</a>, codenamed <i>Old School. </i>In doing the work, I found a bunch of problems with the code I was using to generate RSS feeds. I wrote it a long time ago, probably when I was first doing <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>. Parts of it came from <a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>. It had an assumption baked into it that the items in the feed all went to or came from Twitter. That's not an assumption I can make about my current software. Twitter is important, but it's not <i>everything. </i>;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a110522" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110559"></a>So I decided to try an experiment. In addition to writing the feed in XML, I also wrote it in JSON. It's a very simple matter. I had done a prototype of it in 2012, that's <a href="http://rssjs.org/">archived</a>. The comment thread there is very interesting. It is itself a historic document with comments from people who had strong opinions when core RSS was being discussed in the late 90s and early 00s.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a110559" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110533"></a>One <a href="http://rssjs.org/#comment-652876959">comment</a> in particular, from Julian Bond, someone who rarely agreed with or supported my ideas, had a bit of advice that was, to me, stunning. He argued for not re-litigating the old disputes, and just accept RSS as-is, with all the scars and false starts in place. Of course he had no argument with me. That's exactly what i intended to do. I wasn't signing up for more years of misery on mail lists. I made a conscious decision about that in 2002. Never went back, never want to.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a110533" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110507"></a>Chuck Shotton, a longtime friend, provided a <a href="http://rssjs.org/#comment-645922090">justification</a> for JSONifying RSS. It's a good one and one that I hadn't thought of. It's true that today's RSS-reading apps have to have an XML parser, but there may be new apps that are easier to make in JSON. Non-publishing uses for RSS. I tend only to think of publishing, but Chuck does commercial realtime stuff at considerable scale. I trust his judgement, even if I don't always take his advice. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a110507" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110540"></a>Back to the JSON version of Scripting's RSS 2.0 feed. The translation is very straightforward. It could have been done algorithmically but I decided to do it by hand, to force me to review and understand every element, not just of the base format, but also for a <a href="http://source.scripting.com/">namespace</a> that I use in all my work. I wanted not only to understand how RSS could be transported with a different syntax, JSON, but also how the extension mechanism would make the jump. It worked without a hitch. And honestly I think it's beautiful. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a110540" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110524"></a>I have much to write about this, but I wanted to introduce the idea, and also let people have a look at the result. And here it is.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/30.html#a110524" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a110556"></a>Just before I got up to speak, my marcom person, Kandes Bregman, showed me that Woz was sitting in one of the first rows, like an ordinary person.
