<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a020624"></a><i>Citizen journalism</i> is not a thing. The people are sources. They can now go direct.

<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a080626"></a>This is the first month rollover for the Old School blogging software. Watching for problems. Not expecting any. This is not new technology. For example, here's the monthly archive page <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/">for May</a>, which is now complete. And here's the one <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/">for June</a>, just starting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/01.html#a080626" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a080605"></a>Yesterday I made it so that I can edit the icon bar in the outliner I use to write this blog. But I made it so that I can only edit a few of the icons. Now I think I should be able to edit all of them, and change the order, or the icons. I also want to put them in a special out of the way place so they feel like hardware to the non-tinkering user. Nothing worse than giving a person who's not paying attention such powerful and potentially destructive tools. Kind of like El President√®. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/01.html#a080605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

A move toward blackmail and hostage-taking. And guess who the hostages are.
