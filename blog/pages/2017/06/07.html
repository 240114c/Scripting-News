<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a010635"></a>More fun with NPM packages. This one <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveopml">reads OPML files</a> and handles asynchronous <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#inclusion">includes</a>. This was formerly a local module of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark">PagePark</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/07.html#a010635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Qatar, the US, our military base in Qatar, Egypt, ISIS, Saudi Arabia and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-security-idUSKBN18Y0HV">now Iran</a>, are involved in <a href="http://www.memeorandum.com/170607/p48#a170607p48">what</a>? There's a lot of anger going around. And our president, the idiot savant (hopefully or maybe just the idiot) of international politics seems to be in the middle of it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/07.html#a110643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a110612"></a>I'm using the word <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=deplorable">deplorable</a> more and more. I want to make it a normal word. You can help. When El President√© does something deplorable call it that. It's a good word. Let's take it back.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/07.html#a110612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a110655"></a>I almost used Uber yesterday but I noticed something deplorable about the app. They want to know your location but only offer two options. Either you never let them know your location or you always do. And of course you can't use the app if they don't have access to your location. Now you could turn it off after the ride, but most people would forget. If you just ride Uber once they get to spy on you all the time. Fucked up company. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/07.html#a110655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a100654"></a>Still no mention on MSNBC that <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a050659">the president is racist</a> and is running the US govt accordingly.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/07.html#a100654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Of course. That's what makes JS such a great environment to develop in. And the really dumb thing is I already knew about it, tried it, <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/823930d76b887b462ed6b2c8c4870073">demo'd</a> it. Just 11 days ago. Arrrrgh. Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a040604">said</a> it would be a great idea. My memory is totally overloaded. Thanks to numerous readers for the reminders. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/07.html#a100643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a100600"></a>Since they don't allow outgoing links from blog posts, then the new rule is no links going <i>into</i> FB. Instead, just copy the text from FB and paste it into the open web where it can be linked to.

Instead of complaining in a comment, I just took the text, credited him of course, but no link into FB. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/07.html#a100621" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
