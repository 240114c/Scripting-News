<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a080639"></a>One good thing that came from all the online craziness of the 2016 election is that it eliminated the pretense that everyone's intentions are good. Also that everyone is who they pretend to be. Also that people who appear to be human actually are. We dealt with that kind of mess in RSS-land in the early 00's. In the end we came through it, and <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> is still working today. Our experience could contain some lessons for democracy. üòÑ <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a080639" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a080654"></a>This is a test post. I'll explain in a bit what it's a test for. (Update: It has an <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09/testPodcastForOldSchool.m4a">enclosure</a>.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a080654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's the challenge that keeps pulling me forward, the potential sense of accomplishment, the growing, the learning. Achieving potential is exciting.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a120630" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120628"></a>That's why watching two teams get through the playoffs, one with a perfect record, and the other near-perfect, there's no suspense, no achievement. Nothing interesting, nothing to root for. They've been there before. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a120628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120643"></a>But there's hope!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a120643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120646"></a>This year many of the stars on both teams will be free agents, and all the teams on the outside, all 28 of them, all with just as much if not more money than Golden State and Cleveland, are going to be bidding up the prices. Some are surely going to leave to make more money, to have a chance of escaping from behind the bright glow of the superstars, Curry, James, Durant, Irving, Thompson, Green, etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a120646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120630"></a>Anyway, what <i>would</i> have been exciting? How about Jeremy Lin leading the Nets to the finals? Haha. Well the Celtics would have been a lot of fun. Maybe next year. This year, it's like Ford vs GM. No matter who wins, it's fucking boring. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a120630" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a090613"></a>Back then I assumed everyone meant well, so I would rebut their personal comments. Over time I learned that 99 times out of a hundred the point of a personal comment was to draw you out into defending yourself in public, so more people could pile on, creating a boredom-relieving "accident" the Internet has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html?_r=0">famous</a> for. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a090613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090638"></a>The idea was this. Every blogger would have a designated <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=consigleiri&t=hz&ia=definition">consiglieri</a>. If you have an issue with a blogger, first you had to bring it to the counselor, who would then decide if the issue should be brought to the blogger, i.e. if it had merit, wasn't personal, wasn't an attempt to draw the blogger into a time-wasting personal defense. The person acting as the buffer would insulate the blogger from personal attacks. Thus tamping them down, it was hoped. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a090638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090627"></a>I imagined my consigliere would be Doc. And I would offer to reciprocate. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/09.html#a090627" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
