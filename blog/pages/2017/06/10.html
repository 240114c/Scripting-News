		<li><a name="a110641"></a>I just had to write some complex code in Node that would have been easier to write in Frontier. It had to suck in a calendar-structured folder of archived HTML text into a data structure that roughly parallels the folder structure. Frontier makes this easier in several ways:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110635"></a>1. It's synchronous. But then so is Node if you want it to be and for this application I used the synchronous version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options">fs</a> routines. To do it asynch would have taken hours. And since this is code that runs at startup, who cares if it hogs the CPU. It runs once and that's it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110637"></a>2. Frontier has a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier/blob/master/Common/source/fileloop.c">fileloop</a> construct that does all the stuff you have to do explicitly in JS, baked into its kernel. A time and complexity saver. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110600"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/13/weaselsRippedMyFlesh.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">3. By far the most important thing is Frontier's integrated debugger. I would use the debugger to write the code. Using it to be sure what values were in what variables to save me the time of having to figure it out. People who haven't worked in an environment where the debgger and editor are the same thing wouldn't understand this. It's the one thing I miss the most. (Node does have a debugger and I use it. I write sloppy first versions so I can get to that point of letting the code speak for itself at runtime.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110650"></a>I often skip over these observations because I am deep in codewriting mode when they occur to me. This time I popped out and wrote it down.

		<li><a name="a090637"></a>One thing you <i>never</i> see is an ad for the Democratic Party. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a090637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090648"></a>What they need imho is a campaign, to start, like Trivago's. A few years after that's had a chance to settle in, one of the threads of GEICO's great advertising about insurance. Whoever does their advertising, if they like Democrats, hire them. They really know what they're doing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a090648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090628"></a>Now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRmLcUIqCHI">Trivago</a>, a very new brand, has a simple position that they drive into your head over and over. It goes like this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a090628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

			</ul>
		<li><a name="a090634"></a>Drill that in. Thinking about a hotel? Trivago. They want their word to be stored in your brain in same cell as the other word. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a090634" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a100626"></a>As annoying as their ads are, and they are annoying, it works. The idea is planted. It hasn't yet gotten me to buy a hotel through Trivago.

		<li><a name="a100637"></a>The Democratic Party isn't about anything other than people. That means you. All different kinds of people, but mostly people like you.
