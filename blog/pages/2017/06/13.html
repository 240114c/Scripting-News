<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a120638"></a>Thinking out loud. Seems as if <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">Trump</a> is getting serious about <a href="https://twitter.com/MalcolmNance/status/874644738929967105">blocking</a> people who don't agree with him. But this is something Twitter controls. They almost certainly wouldn't prevent Trump from doing this on their own, but if there were a court order. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a120638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I want to support <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a> format as well, but RIJ is a straight line. I basically already have support for it in River5, because the structure is just RSS. (And of course since it's a <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a> app, it's all converted to a JS object before processing, which is basically JSON.) I've LOL'd about 15 times while getting this together. It's like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization">factoring</a> in mathematics. Lots of "it just works" moments.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a120607" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a120657"></a>One thing I noticed doing this work is that <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/10/13/whatIsAnOpmlSubscriptionList.html">OPML subscription lists</a> have a node type of <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, which of course works for Atom feeds as well. It gets even weirder since the attribute that tells you where the feed is is called <i>xmlURL</i>. Haha. No we're not going to change that just because syntax is now a variable. This goes with the <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html">philosophy</a> of choosing the worst name possible. So the name got worse, which means it actually got better. üêÆ<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a120657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If you went to see them play in Oakland before Curry etc, then you're a real fan. If not, tell me why you care? Nothing exciting about a top team that acquires more top talent simply to make it past another team in the finals. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080611" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080629"></a>Not that I'm crazy about Cleveland, they're the Eastern Division equivalent of the Warriors (I refuse to call them by their cute nickname, basketball is not a cute sport). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080629" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080642"></a>You have to suffer, for a long time, before you <i>earn</i> the title. Sport is highly moral. There's nothing exciting about winning the title using a checkbook. The Warriors are interesting in the same way the character played by <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/silicon-valley-recap-haley-joel-osment-interview">Haley Joel Osment</a> in Silicon Valley is interesting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080642" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080601"></a>Now I look forward to seeing how many of the big <i>free agent</i> stars Cleveland and Golden State can re-sign. üê±<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080601" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080624"></a>PS: I do feel happy for JR Smith and Iman Schumpert, two guys who the Knicks failed who just needed the kind of leadership an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James">LBJ</a> can provide.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080624" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080638"></a>PPS: When the Mets made the World Series in 2015 there were lots of people wearing Mets hats in NYC. It was so funny. Before that, a Mets-hat-sighting was a rare thing. Almost always got a nod and a thumbs up, because Mets fans were so rare. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080645"></a>PPPS: The Mets were one of two teams in MLB who were not the #1 team in a single county in the US. Can you name the other team? (The Mets are now more popular than the Yankees in NYC, though I don't expect that to last.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080638"></a>PPPPS: The Knicks suck, <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=perennial">perennially</a>. Largely because of an inept narcissistic owner. So do the Nets. It's not unusual that NY basketball teams have the highest payroll, we are the largest, richest city in the US after all. But we can't seem to manage a team. Even when we get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Lin#New_York_Knicks_.282011.E2.80.932012.29">gift</a> it's rejected as not sufficiently pious. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080637"></a>PPPPPS: I would not be opposed to NYC trading the Nets for another more interesting team. Like perhaps the Milwaukee Bucks? I like their style. They would be a good NY team. Nothing like that of course will ever happen, but a fan can dream.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080615"></a>PPPPPPS: Failing that it would be cool to have Dolan sell the team to someone with a better organized brain. I thought former Mayor Bloomberg would be a good NBA team owner. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/13.html#a080615" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
