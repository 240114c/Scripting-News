He's a visionary who sees where a new business is possible, bets on it and stays with it to profit from its success. All of these things make him exceptional.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a100610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100632"></a>He also asked a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/875418348598603776">good question</a>. How <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/#a170616p20">can</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/business/media/jeff-bezos-amazon-rich-charity.html?_r=0">his</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-16/amazon-s-jeff-bezos-turns-to-twitter-for-philanthropy-ideas">philanthropy</a> be even more effective. Not some time in the future, but right now. That's the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bezos+philanthropy&t=hz&ia=news">question</a> I was trying to get Bill Gates to ask in the mid-90s when he was trying to turn the web into a feature of Office. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a100632" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110636"></a>My advice for Gates went like this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110636" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

			<li><a name="a110645"></a>I know you say when you're done with Microsoft you're going to devote your life to philanthropy by giving away almost all the money you made. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a110605"></a>But right now you have much higher leverage than you will then. Later your money will be just like everyone else's. But now your money has unique value, because you are the CEO of (at the time) the leading tech company in the world. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a110659"></a>If you can apply the generous spirit of philanthropy to the tech world, you can multiply your contribution many times over. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a110645"></a>I argued that if he relented and let the web exist, even fed its independence, this would be a huge contribution to the world. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a110604"></a>I also argued that it would be good business because his efforts to own the web were doomed to fail. But that was the minor point.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			</ul>
		<li><a name="a110637"></a>So to Jeff Bezos, I'd make the same plea. Right now the Amazon business that I see as most important to the future of humanity is AWS. And it also is very close to the idea of the web, that everyone should be able to control their own online presence, not as a lure for a big company's advertising platform but as a way of sharing ideas and experiences with other people, so we can <i>work together</i> to solve the problems of our species.<i> </i>And we have great problems to solve! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110616"></a>Amazon is already doing a lot there. But they could do more. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

			<li><a name="a110604"></a>In other words commoditize and make almost-free the features of the online world that disempower the individual. Be an idealist about the web. It's time for it to come back into fashion. We've tried turning over all the power to big tech companies and it's had some <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">terrible results</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/16.html#a110604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
