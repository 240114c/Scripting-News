<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a060611"></a>It was a boring NBA postseason, for the most. But the excitement of next season is already starting, with the draft tomorrow, and deal season in full swing. The place to find all the news is <a href="http://nbariver.com/">nbariver.com</a>. It's one of many rivers maintained by my <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> installation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a060611" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a060632"></a>BTW, I hate the term "eating the dogfood." As much as I love dogs, it says that our users are pets, not sentient human beings, our equals. It also says our software is dog food. I think as a kid, as an experiment, a few of us kids actually ate dog food. It's a vague memory, that must have some basis in reality. It makes me nauseous to think about it. And that's what I think about when I hear the term. Please, let's find another way of saying "My software is good because I use it, and vice versa."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a060632" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a070633"></a>Yesterday I posted a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/21/frozenBlogPost.png">screen shot</a> of one of my posts on Facebook, to accolades from friends on Facebook. I deleted the post. I won't be doing it again. Facebook is not a place for blog posts. Not as long as they disable linking, styles, titles and podcasts. If you want to help Facebook destroy the open web, go for it. But I will not participate in that awful adventure.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a070633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031014183603/http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> in 2003. It started as a Radio UserLand project and grew into a leading tech publication, something which I'm personally proud of. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a060659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a060616"></a>He has a <a href="http://altplatform.org/2017/06/20/building-a-blogroll-in-2017/">new blog</a> up and running. I've added it to my <a href="http://scripting.com/river.html">personal river</a> here on Scripting News. He asks about where the blogrolls have gone, a topic I <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/18.html#a110612">wrote about</a> a couple of days ago. Richard would certainly be in my blogroll.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a060616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a060631"></a>Maybe the subscription list <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/23/otherBlogsLikeScriptingNews.html">for</a> my <a href="http://bloggers.scripting.com/">blogger's river</a> would make a good start for my blogroll, or vice versa? Something we didn't do in the first iteration is make our rivers public. Nowadays I'm doing that routinely. A few examples are in the left sidebar here on <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a060631" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a060633"></a>Richard has turned to <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> for the latest on open web tech. That's fine, but you have to look elsewhere too, because as he's discovered, they only embrace part of the open web. It's too bad they chose such an inclusive name, but have an exclusive approach. For example, they have avoided <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, for reasons I'm sure I don't understand (I've listened, so no need to repeat the reasoning). We need all the advantages we can get because there are <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/18.html#a090658">serious</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/10/03/turnsOutLessFacebookIsOk.html">headwinds</a> these days for blogging. RSS is serious open web technology. To not build on it is unthinkable, for me at least. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a060633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a060627"></a>Re integration between writing and reading, another topic of interest to Richard, all my rivers <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/21/postingFromARiver.png">hook</a> into <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>, which is my latest <a href="http://scripting.com/links.html">linkblogging</a> tool. For reading, I encouraged Richard to look at <a href="http://this.how/electricRiver">Electric River</a>, it's the closest to what Radio UserLand did with aggregation in 2002. It runs on your Mac desktop, as the original did. When he wants to go all-in with rivers, nothing can take the place of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>, which is getting both modular and deep. I'm doing more work on that. Rivers have not finished evolving as far as I'm concerned. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a060627" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
