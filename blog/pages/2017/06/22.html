But, the opening scene of episode 1, which takes place in a police office in East Germany during the Cold War, is without explanation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/22.html#a030618" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a030625"></a>Update: In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(season_3)#Episodes">episode guide</a> on Wikipedia they describe the opening scene as follows: "In 1988 East Berlin, Jacob Ungerleider is questioned in the death of a woman, which he claims is a case of mistaken identity." So it's not VM Varga in the hot seat. Who is Jacob Ungerleider? I have no idea! ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/22.html#a030625" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
