<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a020620"></a>It makes sense that because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconciliation_(United_States_Congress)">reconcilliation</a> Repubs have a hard time repealing ObamaCare. It seems fair that you should have to have 60 votes to repeal something that required 60 votes to pass. How will they explain it to the voters they've been lying to about "repeal and replace." Double-talk. Swamp-talk. üëç<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a020620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

RSS is not a product, it's a format. I have never made a dime from it. You have as much at stake in its success as I do. So I always turn it around and ask the person who asked me for a pitch to instead pitch <i>me</i> on it. I don't budge on this.

<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a110610"></a>Is anyone using the <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.json">JSON version</a> of the Scripting News feed in their feed reader?

		<li><a name="a090655"></a>It won't take much to reboot the tech blogosphere, just a few bloggers with ideas who listen to each other and want to work with each other. That was the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/02/08/holdinghandsincyberspace.html">idea</a> behind blogrolls, to visibly show the relationships. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<ul class="ulLevel1">
			<li><a name="a100617"></a>I'm still thinking about how to integrate a blogroll with the new design of <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. I pushed everything aside to get a clean look for the new site. I want to avoid bringing it all back. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a100617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a090609"></a>So, we have a few people who are writing and listening. That's a needed first step. Next we need a way to announce and hear about new tech products. Not just ones that get VC backing or come from big companies. We already hear about those products through <a href="http://techmeme.com/">TechMeme</a> and the pubs that contribute to it. We also have platform-specific news about tech products, it's more limited, but it's there.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090604"></a>It will likely start with word of mouth among the bloggers. If <a href="http://altplatform.org/2017/06/20/building-a-blogroll-in-2017/">Richard</a> is using a product and speaks highly of it, I'm likely to take a look. Especially if he says it fits into what I'm doing through the open formats my software already supports. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090604"></a>Then I want a river, a place where I can go to find out quickly what's new, in the way of products, not BigCo bluster or another $250 million VC deal. I want to know what my peers are doing. So I can learn from them, and so we can make our products work with theirs. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090633"></a><i>Work together</i> is a phrase you'll hear me use a lot. It's the potential of tech, but it often isn't the attitude of tech. Even the smallest most independent developers dream of dominating. You can't work with people who dominate, even if they win. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040641"></a>I want to hear about products that are open to connecting to mine. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a040641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090602"></a>There have been times, often defined by news sources, that have created huge swells of compatible technology. To name a few: InfoWorld, PC WEEK, MacWEEK, TechCrunch. Very fond memories of the communities that gathered around each of those. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090602"></a>It's time for another. The opportunity is there. It's been a long time since we had an open development community that worked to create great new user experience without lockin. It's like riding a bicycle or swimming, you don't forget how to do it. And like tennis or baseball, you can't play without partners and competition. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
