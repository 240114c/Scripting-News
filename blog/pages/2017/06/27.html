		<li><a name="a080628"></a>A frequently asked question: <i>How do I export my outlines?</i> It's a trick question. You don't. They are sitting in your Dropbox folder in a standard open <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">format</a>, supported by any reasonable outliner. They will still be there tomorrow after Fargo stops working.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a080628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090643"></a>BTW, it couldn't hurt to copy them out of your Dropbox folder into a backup somewhere. Better safe than sorry. üê±<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a090643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080646"></a> A <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/08/24/fargoTimesOutOnJune2017.html">reminder</a>, they changed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>, and today is the last day the old version of the API works. I decided not to maintain Fargo, so when the old API is turned off Fargo will stop working. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a080646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080613"></a>If you like the outliner in Fargo, it's available in another package, <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a>. The outliner is also available as <a href="https://github.com/scripting/concord">open source</a>, so if you want, perhaps you can get another developer to make it work with Dropbox. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a080613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080606"></a>Fargo is a great product, but what I hoped would happen with it, has not happened. It is tightly integrated with the Dropbox platform, which has not taken off as a developer ecosystem. I wish it had, but the fact is that it hasn't. At some point you have to cut your losses. That's part of development too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a080606" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I knew this would happen with the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&t=h_&ia=web">Old School</a> redesign, because I am immersed in their worlds. Basically every day has the same big image. That sucks because the image has nothing to do with what's being pointed to. They designed their metadata for a model that does not fit my blogging style. For a while I changed my style to accomodate them. But as you know I don't do that anymore. Now I am myself and if they don't like it, etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a060614" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a060650"></a>Anyway, I was including an image that never changed in the metadata. Not only did this screw up Twitter and Facebook, but it also screwed up other apps that read their metadata. Like Slack and apparently Feedly.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a060650" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a060637"></a>So I nuked the image. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a060637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a060641"></a>It's still at the top of the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog. But it's not in the metadata. Let's try that for a while and see if it makes things better. It'll probably break something else. That's how this stuff works. Or doesn't.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a060641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a050631"></a>Which begs the question -- what is a blog?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a050631" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a100747"></a>We need a reboot of the blogosphere. It's not that every blog has so much value, but some do. Think of the 2008 financial crisis and the blogs and podcasts that were born out of that. The same should be happening now. I'm sure it is, we just have to find it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a100747" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a050610"></a>The solution is not going to come from Twitter or Facebook. The big news orgs are good at channeling leaks, but not new ideas. Quite the opposite, they're desperately trying to cling to the sensibility of the World Before Trump. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a050610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100747"></a>Anyway, the first step imho is to understand that we have a way out. We just have to decide to use it. That means getting over the idea that journalism and blogging are the same thing. As long as we believe that, there really isn't any hope. (Imho of course.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a100747" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100747"></a>Because the circumstances are so dire, it's a very exciting time to have new ideas, because there's a small chance they might take hold. When everything is "normal" the chance for innovation isn't so great. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/27.html#a100747" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a050636"></a>There's no action item here, other than listen for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnIL4KXQI2g">stranger</a> with great ideas and when you hear one, tell everyone about what you heard. The ideas must be out there now. We just have to turn in their direction.
