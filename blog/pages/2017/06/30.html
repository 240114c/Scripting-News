Kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_chairs">musical chairs</a> fueled by billions of dollars. Who is the most popular free agent, landing spot?

<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a070628"></a><img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/06/06/michaelJordan.gif" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A year ago today the new Knicks coach <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/knicks-coach-ny-isn-rebuilding-city-win-now-town-article-1.2694767?utm_content=buffer90dbf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=NYDNSports+Twitter">said</a> the Knicks are a <i>win-now</i> team. So they shipped off three healthy players in a <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/knicks-trade-for-derrick-rose-send-lopez-grant-to-bulls-grades-takeaways/">trade</a> for <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/04/05/two-ex-knicks-in-derrick-rose-trade-finding-niche-in-chicago/">two players</a> with too many miles on their legs. A replay of the disastrous win-now <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/05/nba-draft-lottery-2017-boston-celtics-why-lottery-pick-awful-trade-brooklyn-nets-kevin-garnett-paul-pierce-breakdown">strategy</a> of the Nets, which <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/26/15875468/d-angelo-russell-press-conference-nets-future-lottery-pick">now</a> have them in solid rebuilding mode. Win-now is a shitty strategy, esp for the Knicks. Never has a team needed more to see itself as a work in progress. The thing the win-now proponents don't understand is that fans <i>like</i> teams with long-term strategies. They might bitch and moan about not winning or contending for a title, but a team with hope draws fan <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/02/25/thisThisIsWhyWeLikeBasketball.html">interest</a>. A foolish team that makes shitty short-term bets? Well there are always other sports to watch. ‚öæÔ∏è<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/30.html#a070628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a090637"></a>My friend Liza <a href="https://twitter.com/blogdiva/status/880774516665962496">explains</a> that when you cheat crowds are small. Good point. Look Russia may not have affected the outcome of the election as they say (I have my doubts) but I'm pretty sure that voter suppression did. Which is why they have to run those nasty NRA videos, to make us think they're huge. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/30.html#a090637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a090618"></a>Also, the NRA, which is basically a trade association for gun manufacturers, has to sell a certain number of guns every year, beyond what's out there. Increase the installed base in a saturated market. The only way to do that is to escalate fear. Rational or not. It doesn't matter, as long as it sells the product. The video we saw yesterday was a sales pitch. I wonder if she gets a commission on gun sales. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/30.html#a090618" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I want to transmit the full content of an item in a new context. And the software currently doesn't do that. Okay it's only 271 chars. I must keep typing.

The person who offended him so many years ago and the president are now in completely different leagues.

Not a person running for a school board in a small state in a quiet part of the country he's in charge of. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/30.html#a110623" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
