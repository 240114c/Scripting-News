<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a110602"></a>I'm digging around in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/davereader">davereader</a> today. Seeing how feasible it would be to have a single-feed viewer in <a href="http://this.how/electricRiver">Electric River</a>. That is, all the stories from one feed in reverse chronologic order.

For example, how many readers care about whether they send a reporter to White House press briefings or not? Or how Facebook is ruining the news business? (A topic for a trade pub.) Or stories about amazing nasty shit the president says. (Giving the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/28/dontFeedDjTrump.html">troll</a> a platform just encourages him.) Something like having a panel of readers and a UI like <a href="http://scripting.com/futureNews.html">checkbox news</a>. Keep it going real time. In fact, for cable news you can put your video right there in the page. Update the checkboxes according to your editorial schedule. And adjust the schedule in accordance with what you learn from viewers.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090603" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I know the reality. I live in the middle of NYC. I see a few protests here and there. The police observe, respectfully, no one gets hurt. This is America. If people don't like something they protest. It's a good thing about our country. Free speech. It's in the Constitution. I recall people who didn't like President Obama availed themselves of their First Amendment rights. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a030623" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040600"></a>The NRA ad attacks the First Amendment and threatens violence. The only line it doesn't cross is racial. I'm sure they're getting ready for that too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a040600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a030642"></a>However, if you think the police are huge fans of the NRA, think again. Watch this <a href="https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/880464645806374912">video</a> of the Milwaukee police chief, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_A._Flynn">Edward Flynn</a>. Wisconsin's NRA-written gun law makes Milwaukee a lot more dangerous, and their jobs.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a030642" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a030606"></a>The two stories make a fantastic contrast. I think perhaps the NRA is worried that the police are onto them. And they're speaking out. And the gun people want to try to nullify it? I don't know, but I don't see this ad persuading too many people in New York. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a030606" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a030648"></a>My friend Mike Rodriquez who lives in Kansas wants to know what to do. I thought about it. Maybe it's time to leave Kansas Mike. Most of the people in the country don't live in places like that. Small states like Kansas have oversized power due to the way the Senate is designed. But they're talking about extra-legal acts (i.e. illegal). If the people of Kansas are going to start shooting law-abiding Americans, I would guess they're going to spend a lot of time in jail. And if you don't want to be a victim, then just get the fuck out of there.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a030648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a090612"></a>Interesting to see Microsoft <a href="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/880222183066263557">promoting</a> their new series of podcasts.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090632"></a>Reminds me, when I was living in Seattle in the summer of 2004, I was visiting various parts of Microsoft to see if there was business we could do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090632" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090601"></a>That summer was the moment podcasting clicked. I was doing Morning Coffee Notes. Adam had started Daily Source Code. Dawn and Drew. Dave Slusher. Trade Secrets. And more and then even more. What had been an idea was now blossoming into a medium. You could see it happening. Every day was a revelation. So I sought out a meeting with the people at Microsoft who were developing what would become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune">Zune</a>, which was doomed, you could see it, the iPod was too much of a juggernaut. There was no room for a <a href="http://anildash.com/2006/11/brown-zune.html">brown</a> music player <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zune-Digital-Media-Player-Brown/dp/B000H0QDCC">device</a> that did what Apple already did. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090601" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090619"></a>But, this new thing, podcasting, needed a player device. The iPod was a terrible player. It was designed for music. You buy music. You store a song on your desktop and mobile device. You listen to a song many times over months or years. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090619" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090656"></a>Podcasting was different. You download a podcast as part of a series. It's a subscription. You pay nothing. You listen once and throw it away. Music is permanent, podcasts are ephemeral. A device for listening to podcasts would make it easy to listen to more podcasts. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090656" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090607"></a>There was an opening at the time for a device that was insanely great at podcasting. And it would give Microsoft something innovative to promote. A reason for the Zune to exist, at a time when it had none.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090607" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090605"></a>Unfortunately I learned there, and with all the other interactions with Microsoft, that while they felt they were innovative, they had no appreciation for how innovation happens. It isn't something you put in a budget or a five-year plan. It's something that happens. One day a killer idea shows up out of nowhere, and you have to be prepared to hear it. They were not, clearly, prepared. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090625"></a>A year ago I tried again with Microsoft. I had an idea I thought they needed. They were very nice. They were told I was an industry founder, I guess. But they had no context to understand what I was talking about. You make software you say? Very nice. See you later. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a090625" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Proof is Tumblr, he says. But while I was reading the article I thought of something they might not have tried at Tumblr. Seeding users with test units of products. Or taking 100 bloggers from some random city to a new movie a week before it comes out and letting them write about it. Even negative reviews would get them exposure. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/29.html#a080625" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080638"></a>They probably thought of it. It seems kind of obvious. You can put ads in the stream, but that's un-Tumblr-like, or you can give users a basis to write about your product.

		<li><a name="a080632"></a>Here's the basic idea. There's a difference between importing OPML into a reader and subscribing to it.

Michael Arrington even wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/16/my-thoughts-on-reading-lists/">TechCrunch piece</a> about it in 2005. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/26.html#a080601" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

And they have an API, and they understood the connection to one-page-apps earlier than anyone. But it didn't happen. I've emailed with people at Dropbox from time to time and the best explanation I can come up with is that they are focused in different areas. It seems to me, from my outside perch, that they are trying to become a competitor to <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/">Google's</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office">Microsoft's</a> Office products.

		<li><a name="a090655"></a>It won't take much to reboot the tech blogosphere, just a few bloggers with ideas who listen to each other and want to work with each other. That was the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/02/08/holdinghandsincyberspace.html">idea</a> behind blogrolls, to visibly show the relationships. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<ul class="ulLevel1">
			<li><a name="a100617"></a>I'm still thinking about how to integrate a blogroll with the new design of <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. I pushed everything aside to get a clean look for the new site.

			</ul>
		<li><a name="a090609"></a>So, we have a few people who are writing and listening. That's a needed first step. Next we need a way to announce and hear about new tech products. Not just ones that get VC backing or come from big companies. We already hear about those products through <a href="http://techmeme.com/">TechMeme</a> and the pubs that contribute to it. We also have platform-specific news about tech products, it's more limited, but it's there.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090604"></a>It will likely start with word of mouth among the bloggers. If <a href="http://altplatform.org/2017/06/20/building-a-blogroll-in-2017/">Richard</a> is using a product and speaks highly of it, I'm likely to take a look. Especially if he says it fits into what I'm doing through the open formats my software already supports. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090604"></a>Then I want a river, a place where I can go to find out quickly what's new, in the way of products, not BigCo bluster or another $250 million VC deal. I want to know what my peers are doing. So I can learn from them, and so we can make our products work with theirs. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090633"></a><i>Work together</i> is a phrase you'll hear me use a lot. It's the potential of tech, but it often isn't the attitude of tech. Even the smallest most independent developers dream of dominating. You can't work with people who dominate, even if they win. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/24.html#a090633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a090602"></a>There have been times, often defined by news sources, that have created huge swells of compatible technology. To name a few: InfoWorld, PC WEEK, MacWEEK, TechCrunch.

		<li><a name="a100630"></a>Two friends, <a href="https://twitter.com/judell">Jon Udell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/holden">Mike Caulfield</a>, are talking about "dumb" servers. I call the same things "thin." Also fractional-horsepower servers. They go by a bunch of names, but the idea and motivation is the same. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/23.html#a100630" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100635"></a>The idea: We move functionality from the server to the edge (desktop, mobile device), repeating until someday there's nothing left on the server. We could go all the way, but it needs a strong operational backend, something a big company is good at, not so much individuals. (With the caveat that some think this problem is distributable, notably the fictional <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/richard-hendriks#/entity">CEO</a> of <a href="http://www.piedpiper.com/">Pied Piper</a>.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/23.html#a100635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Once you have that solved, it all becomes relatively easy. I've factored out identity into a layer I call <a href="https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage">nodeStorage</a>. It associates storage with a user's Twitter identity. Twitter is a good service to use, unlike some others, because they have a liberal policy of who gets to <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new">create</a> apps. Faceook has an extensive vetting process. Twitter <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new">is</a> "let a thousand flowers bloom." I know some people have problems with Twitter, but I've learned over many years that all corporate vendors are imperfect. If you're waiting for <a href="http://this.how/standards#1497798834000">perfection</a> you'll wait forever. And you build the software so that if Twitter should again become draconian, a new service can be filled in with as little disruption as possible.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/23.html#a100643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100641"></a>Another place I've looked is Dropbox. There, with one simple feature, the ability to associate a domain with a folder, they would solve the problem. I know there are external services that provide something "like" this, but fundamentally Dropbox doesn't provide enough flexibility in the API to do this in a reasonable way. (Lack of granularity in permissions, an app gets access to one folder or everything.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/23.html#a100641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100610"></a>Or Amazon, if their identity system for AWS were simpler for end users, or if their end-user storage system could be accessed through the S3 API. I'm sure they've thought of it. There must be a reason they don't do it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/23.html#a100610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100655"></a>And Twitter could completely eliminate the need for nodeStorage, by offering users a few gigabytes of storage attached to their Twitter account, accessible through the API. The first person who described the feature to me was Jack Dorsey, about eight years ago, when we met for coffee in SF. So he understands why this idea is so powerful. I'm not sure what the holdup is.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/23.html#a100655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100610"></a>In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage">nodeStorage</a> works. I build the kind of apps I want. Open the sidebar on Scripting News (left margin) and have a look at the apps. Some even have <a href="https://github.com/scripting/macwrite/blob/master/macwrite.js">source code</a> so you can see for yourself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/23.html#a100610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

He started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031014183603/http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> in 2003. It started as a Radio UserLand project and grew into a leading tech publication, something which I'm personally proud of. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/21.html#a060659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

That's fine, but you have to look elsewhere too, because as he's discovered, they only embrace part of the open web. It's too bad they chose such an inclusive name, but have an exclusive approach. For example, they have avoided <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, for reasons I'm sure I don't understand (I've listened, so no need to repeat the reasoning).

It runs on your Mac desktop, as the original did.

I've spent years using both, I think I have an objective view of the strengths of each. Imho, they are almost the same thing. XML has attributes and values, and that does make it more complex. Slightly. But you don't have to use the extra features. Look at <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">OPML</a> for an idea of a simple very JSON-like application of XML. Beyond that, there's really no difference. If you disagree, write a post, link to this and send me the link. I will read what you wrote, and respond, on <a href="http://scripting.com/">my blog</a>, if I have something to say.  There's been so much bullshit flying around.

<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a050626"></a>Projects are the most fun when they're new, when you're building them up. Later, when you're adding features or fixing bugs, adapting to a platform change, you have to remember how it all works.

<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a050609"></a>Writing occurs in many places these days, as does reading. It was easier when there was no writing and no reading. Now there's too much of both. And they don't work with each other, not just at a technical level, but a conceptual level. They all have a different idea of what an idea is. Some have titles some have character limits. Some allow links others don't. It helps to identify this clearly as the problem, because while there is no solution, it suggests an optimal compromise.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/18.html#a050609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a090653"></a>Engagement on Facebook comes in the form of comments. But the comments rarely illuminate. They're mostly echoes of ideas that I've heard many times before. Tired worn-out ideas. Ideas that weren't interesting the first time, and are weary-inducing the 19th time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/18.html#a090653" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090633"></a>Here I've set it up so there is no response mechanism. I want to learn to write that way. I hope to write a book at some point. And that is mostly an exercise in writing for yourself. There's no engagement until you're done. A book is like a freezer for ideas. Blogging is more like a dandelion spreading its seed in the wind. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/18.html#a090633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090602"></a>You can blog on Facebook, but you won't be able to link. I can blog on the web and link, and leave a record (try finding a previous post on Facebook sometime), but hey searching on the web is getting worse not better. Google doesn't really want search to work, they want you to see their ads.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/18.html#a090602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090643"></a>Anyway, you can keep blogging on Facebook, and I still use it so I might see what you wrote.

		<li><a name="a080622"></a>There is a single important idea in PagePark, something I've always wanted in a web server -- it maps domains to folders. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/18.html#a080622" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080623"></a>Suppose you register a new domain, hello.wtf. To host it in PagePark, create a new sub-folder of the domains folder called hello.wtf. Add a file called index.html. Then map the domain to the server PagePark is running on. And that's it. You don't have to update any configuration files, or write any scripts or rules. PagePark knows where to look when a request comes in, it sees an index file (it could also be index.txt, index.png, index.md or index.js) and serves it.

		<li><a name="a120637"></a>Here's the deal. Old School has a websocket connection with the content server. When I update the blog outline, it sends a message to Old School saying I updated and also includes the JSON text of the outline. It's big.

		<li><a name="a120657"></a>When the message comes in, the text is attached temporarily to the object that represents the blog in Old School, until it's processed by the handler that then proceeds to do nothing with it (the feature is turned off, I don't want updates determined by text changes). It then deletes the text that was attached to the blog object.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/17.html#a120657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120602"></a>At the same time, a message must have come in from me, saying "Build the blog now" -- and once in a while, very rarely, when it does this the text is attached, and it gets added to the jstruct that's included in the rendered page. Why? Well it could come in handy some day.

		<li><a name="a030645"></a>I was just discussing the California state senate with Bram Cohen on Facebook. (No links to Facebook, sorry.) So in California they call the state senate the senate not some other word like guffmab (made up word). How did they come up with this name? Well most states had two-chamber legislatures, and they were mostly called the senate and assembly. Since California was a relative latecomer to the union, even though it has always been an innovative and different place, they went with the established conventions.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/15.html#a030645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a030644"></a>And all those previous states were of course copying the US government, which called its upper chamber the senate too. For some reason they didn't all go with the name of the lower chamber, there must be an interesting story to go with that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/15.html#a030644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Why not. Everyone knew what a senate was, why not leverage that, keep confusion down, help people feel comfortable.

Using the Roman name gave a familiarity and legitimacy to what they were doing that a new name couldn't have. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/15.html#a030635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I want to support <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a> format as well, but RIJ is a straight line. I basically already have support for it in River5, because the structure is just RSS.

		<li><a name="a080638"></a>PPS: When the Mets made the World Series in 2015 there were lots of people wearing Mets hats in NYC. It was so funny. Before that, a Mets-hat-sighting was a rare thing.

		<li><a name="a080638"></a>PPPPS: The Knicks suck, <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=perennial">perennially</a>. Largely because of an inept narcissistic owner. So do the Nets. It's not unusual that NY basketball teams have the highest payroll, we are the largest, richest city in the US after all. But we can't seem to manage a team.

		<li><a name="a110641"></a>I just had to write some complex code in Node that would have been easier to write in Frontier. It had to suck in a calendar-structured folder of archived HTML text into a data structure that roughly parallels the folder structure. Frontier makes this easier in several ways:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110635"></a>1. It's synchronous. But then so is Node if you want it to be and for this application I used the synchronous version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options">fs</a> routines. To do it asynch would have taken hours. And since this is code that runs at startup, who cares if it hogs the CPU. It runs once and that's it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110637"></a>2. Frontier has a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier/blob/master/Common/source/fileloop.c">fileloop</a> construct that does all the stuff you have to do explicitly in JS, baked into its kernel. A time and complexity saver. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

By far the most important thing is Frontier's integrated debugger. I would use the debugger to write the code. Using it to be sure what values were in what variables to save me the time of having to figure it out. People who haven't worked in an environment where the debgger and editor are the same thing wouldn't understand this. It's the one thing I miss the most. (Node does have a debugger and I use it. I write sloppy first versions so I can get to that point of letting the code speak for itself at runtime.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/10.html#a110600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a080639"></a>One good thing that came from all the online craziness of the 2016 election is that it eliminated the pretense that everyone's intentions are good. Also that everyone is who they pretend to be. Also that people who appear to be human actually are. We dealt with that kind of mess in RSS-land in the early 00's. In the end we came through it, and <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> is still working today.

If you have an issue with a blogger, first you had to bring it to the counselor, who would then decide if the issue should be brought to the blogger, i.e. if it had merit, wasn't personal, wasn't an attempt to draw the blogger into a time-wasting personal defense. The person acting as the buffer would insulate the blogger from personal attacks.

I was using Google figuring that they'd be the most long-lived search engine -- the links would likely work years from now. But it all comes down to what "work" <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=work&t=h_&ia=web">means</a>. Google is playing <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/30/strategyTax.html">strategy tax</a> games with search. I no longer consider it authoritative. It misses too many things that are important for reasons that have nothing to do with their value as a search result. I'm bettting that DuckDuckGo has a stronger philosophy and even if they were not to last as long as Google they're still worth supporting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I sent this to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/danmactough?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Dan MacTough</a> who wrote the <a href="https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser">FeedParser</a> package for Node that I use in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>. "How about a package that compiles XML text into a JavaScript  object exactly as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse">JSON.parse</a> does." I got this idea from reading promotional material for the <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a> project. One of their concerns is that XML parsing is too hard. Okay, that's feedback. I think they're right. So let's make it as easy. Easy is good.

The last part is left to your imagination in TechCrunch.

		<li><a name="a040610"></a>I'm indirectly quoted in the TechCrunch story. They point to Gruber's <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/06/fuck_facebook">piece</a> entitled <i>Fuck Facebook,</i> and it extensively quotes a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/31.html#a110526">piece</a> I wrote that explains why I can't/won't point to blog posts on Facebook. I followed up to <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a010637">say</a> I continue to use FB and hope they fix the problem and turn FB into a fantastic blogging surface that I can cross-post to from my blog.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a040610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040602"></a>I wasn't kidding. I really have no use for FB as a blogging platform as long as they shun the web that gave them life. It was the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=primordial+soup&t=h_&ia=web">primordial soup</a> they emerged from. Without it, 11-year-old Zuck would have had no way to experiment with social nets. But now Facebook so obviously tries to keep the web out, but my writing depends on the ability to integrate the writing of the web. It's like programming without the ability to factor replicated code into subroutines. <i>In FB blogging you're starting from scratch every time. </i>Yet Zuck uses Facebook to communicate with his users. His posts never have links and no titles, no styling. Just huge numbers of long paragraphs one after the other. That's probably one of the reasons I never read his posts. Maybe his thinking doesn't build on other people's ideas either? I've never met Zuck. Maybe that tells you something. Do you think the Beatles met Chuck Berry? Weird example I know. :shrug:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a040602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040630"></a>Should we let the news orgs off the hook? Of course not. They're even worse than Facebook. At least FB lets us post as equals to Zuck. And that's meant some voices have gained traction on FB without approval of Zuck and Company. Examples are numerous. But the NYT? You have to belong to a very exclusive club to be invited to post on their site. You have to know someone. And they have to like you. And that keeps out the truly good ideas. I know that when I read the NYT. I am welcome to read, and to pay, but my ideas aren't good enough to appear alongside the writers of the NYT. So they're even more of a silo than FB. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a040630" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040628"></a>I still want the web. Look at the post I wrote yesterday about <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a080612">RSS-in-JSON</a>. I spent a lot of time thinking about it, preparing, reading background material. How sterile it would have been if I could only <i>mention</i> the work I learned from instead of giving you, the reader, who I respect, a chance to read for yourself. Maybe you'd come to a different conclusion? You have to know, after all these <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/10/07/20YearsOfBlogging.html">years</a>, that that's totally OK with me.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a040628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040610"></a>I want the web and Facebook won't give it to me. So I think now Facebook has a huge self-imposed limit to growth, just like the journalists. Eventually I believe they will pay for it. Yet the conventional wisdom in tech is that Facebook won, they killed the goose that gave them the golden egg. I wouldn't bet on it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a040610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I wanted to see if there was interest among developers for a JSON version of RSS. I put up a <a href="http://rssjs.org/">website</a>, with comments, and added a JSON feed to my blog (technically it was JSONP). Wired even asked me to write a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/09/rss-in-json-for-real/">piece</a> about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a080624" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080603"></a>Not much happened with the feed, but the comments underneath the post were quite impressive, especially now, five years later. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a080603" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080637"></a>Then my friends Brent Simmons and Manton Reece, two developers with a strong interest in syndication (Brent wrote <a href="http://inessential.com/category/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> and Manton is currently working on <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>) published a spec for a format they call <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>.

It was off to a strong start. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a080637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a080607"></a>I had mixed feelings about this, and wrote it up in a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/21/reEvanWilliamsAndJsonFeed.html">post</a> a couple of days after the format was announced. I was concerned about whether there was demand for JSON syntax among people who actually produce feeds and write software that consumes feeds. I understand how developers feel, but how many of them are responsible for the flow of RSS-based news? I was also concerned because they were creating new names for things that already existed in RSS 2.0. I had the same concern with Atom, many years ago. Why not start with the same names, and add to them where needed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a080607" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a090616"></a>But there was interest in the JSON Feed format as evidenced by the long list of <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues">comments</a> on the GitHub site where it is being discussed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/05.html#a090616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

And The Leftovers was such an unusual show, a big enigma, with a lot of sleight of hand it turns out, you had to wonder how they were going to wrap things up, with the plot of the whole three-season show so uncertain.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/04.html#a110614" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110658"></a>It turns out that 1/2 of the plot was revealed in Episode One of Season One, and the other half wasn't revealed until the final minutes of the last episode. Inbetween? Haha. But they did it. It really does make sense in a science fiction way. If you accept the premise that 2 percent of the population could disappear in an instant, and if you watched the show all the way to the end you had to accept it, then you can certainly accept the resolution, the explanation of how it balances, the symmetry of it. They even showed you the symmetry, with Nora's story, the one character for whom it made sense to make a round trip.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/04.html#a110658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110650"></a>I love it. I love it because when the show was originally pitched, the symmetry must have been the whole pitch. Just like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_to_Person_(Mad_Men)">punchline</a> of Mad Men was also for sure the pitch for the show. Yet I didn't see it coming in The Leftovers. In hindsight it seems so obvious. And I spent some time thinking about it. At least the 30 or so hours I've spent watching episodes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/04.html#a110650" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110649"></a>The best punchline is the one you didn't see coming which then seems totally obvious. The Leftovers, for me at least, delivered.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/04.html#a110649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110602"></a>I also like that they began the last episode with the Season 2 theme song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlaoR5m4L80">Let The Mystery Be</a> by Iris DeMent. What a great song, great performer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/04.html#a110602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a010636"></a>Journalists widely said Apple was dead in the mid-90s.

So journalist-based hype has a practical effect in addition to selling magazines.

		<li><a name="a100647"></a>Okay -- look at it this way.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a100647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100655"></a>1. Russia interfered in our last election. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a100655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100607"></a>2. Was this surprising? Yes. Predictable? In hindsight, yes. Our communication system in the US is open. With the advent of social media and trolls, interference could be systematized and scaled, and it was, and they managed to elect a president who is very bad for us and very good for Russia. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a100607" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100611"></a>3. Is it avoidable in the future? Hmmm. Hard to see how, if we're going to have universal suffrage and respect the First Amendment. So it's fair to expect that Russia will play a role in future elections. And they will keep innovating, finding new ways to infect our discourse with their depravity. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a100611" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100616"></a>4. So, if it's unavoidable, what to do? Well, at least we could invite in some foreign influences that push us in a good direction. France and Germany, for example.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a100616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100644"></a>5. One more thing, it's always bothered me that our elections determine so much about the future of the world, esp when we start unnecessary wars in far-away places. Should the people of Iraq and Afghanistan have had a say in past American elections? There's a case to be made for that, imho.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/03.html#a100644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Fact is Trump is president. No guarantees there will be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States">correction</a>. He has power he hasn't yet figured out that he has, or only recently has figured out. Power that no honorable president would use.

In the past the Repubs have played at brinksmanship, extracting concessions from the president, who was a Democrat. The assumption was the president would act responsibly. But now we have a bomb thrower in the White House.

I want to do it so that it's easy to restore a bit of functionality that didn't make it into the new Frontier.root. I want it all to be at most one click away.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a100636" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100643"></a>So this means storing the objects in multiple forms.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a100643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<ul class="ulLevel1">
			<li><a name="a100657"></a>1. A human-readable form. One of the nice things about GitHub is that there's a web interface, and you can click around and look at stuff. It's a nice way to view code. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a100657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a100627"></a>2. A "binary" representation, in quotes because Frontier doesn't actually emit objects in binary.

			<li><a name="a100647"></a>3. An OPML version. Many of the objects in the database are outlines. All the scripts are, for example. And menubars.

		<li><a name="a090634"></a>I've been hanging out online with a group of Mac influentials, and it's nice, but there's a problem (for me). They don't like Twitter and Facebook, and don't use them, and there's resistence to building tools that connect with them. I think this not a good thing. It bothered me. And then I finally figured out the source of the bother.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a090634" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090643"></a>First, I've asked, and the reason they don't like Twitter is that they fucked over their developers. It's true. I was one of them. I had a sizable base of Twitter software. But I expected it. So when it came I was neither surprised nor unprepared. What prepared me for it so well? The company whose products my friends are devoted to. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a090643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090648"></a>Apple taught me very well. There was a day in 1997 or 1998 when Steve Jobs got up on a very small stage in Cupertino and introduced the products that would replace us. It was as thorough a betrayal as ever has been done in the tech world. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a090648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090625"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/02/twittergram.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Yet today I am writing this on a Mac. I have an iPhone hooked into the Mac, and an iPad charging in the living room. I've bought tens of thousands of dollars of Apple products. I also own a bit of Apple stock, bought in the aftermath of the betrayal. I wanted some upside from all the losses. I still hold the stock today, the profits on paper have been substantial. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a090625" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100635"></a>I use Apple's products because they work the best for me. After spending a proper amount of time being pissed and being proud of my independence, I realized that I was the loser here, twice. First with the business and creative loss. And second because I had to use malware-infested Windows machines. Once I saw that I could be happy using a Mac, I said fuck it to my refusal and got on board, as a user this time, not a developer.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a100635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090640"></a>Twitter today is different from the company that was so mean to its developers. That was pre-IPO Twitter. They were desperately trying to get in position to go public. They felt that developers were a problem. They behaved like all tech companies do. Selfish and short-sighted. Lots to not like there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a090640" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100635"></a>They <i>can</i> do it again. I assume they will. But for the time-being I am using them, because it makes sense to. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a100635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090621"></a>Twitter is also the place where news is distributed. I never believed in Facebook as a news place, but Twitter is a important for news flow. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a090621" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090601"></a>And I think perhaps we can work with them. In the meantime they operate their servers at scale. The president of the United States uses Twitter. It's a fixture. Using Twitter is like flying United or Delta. You have to do it, no matter how much you don't like it. Imho.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/02.html#a090601" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
