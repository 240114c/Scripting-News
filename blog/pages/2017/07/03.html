I don't think the video of Trump body slamming <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Trump+body+slamming+CNN&ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch">CNN</a> is inciteful of anything. It's the equivalent of a cartoon on the editorial page of a news site. I don't see what the big deal is. It would be totally different if he was aiming it at a specific person. On a scale of 1 to 10 of offensiveness I'd rate it a 1.5. Kathy Griffin's bloody severed <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/kathy-griffin-apologizes-for-photo-with-bloody-trump-head.html">Trump head</a> would be an 8 or 9, because that's a <i>person's</i> head, not a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZkjJbXMDZI">symbol</a> of a corporation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/03.html#a090727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090740"></a>It's not your job to react to every Trump tweet. These are hardly news anymore. There was a time when just by continuing to tweet he was escalating the offensiveness. Now he has to ramp up the actual content of the tweets to continue to get a rise. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/03.html#a090740" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

He's not tweeting to get a rise out of his base, he's doing it to get <i>you</i> to react.

Trump may not stop right away, but we all know that he's doing it to cover up some pretty insidious shit like his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy">kleptocracy</a>, the fact that he's owned by Russia (obviously he was in the money laundering business for Putin before he ran for president) and voter <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/06/trump-administrations-request-for-extensive-voter-data-raises-fears-of-suppression/">suppression</a>, designed to keep Democrats permanently out of office in all branches of government.

		<li><a name="a090745"></a>You all are acting like his bitches (to borrow another concept from popular culture). Hey maybe you all are on the Russian payroll too. We need to have real journalism, no dispute there, but you're achieving his prophecy, becoming the fraud he says you are. Reacting to Trump tweets is easy. But it's also wrong, tiresome, irrelevant, and <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/12/02/whatWentWrongWithJournalism.html">bad journalism</a>. Stop doing it.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/03.html#a090745" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
