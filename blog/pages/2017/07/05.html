		<li><a name="a040713"></a>Instead of providing an off-Twitter place to post and figuring out how to integrate it with Twitter, as a secondary function, pngWriter posts directly to Twitter, that's its primary purpose. And it also provides an <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0</a> feed, so the same flow can be integrated with <i>open web</i> apps. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üéà</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/05.html#a040713" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040756"></a>It's also highly customizable through CSS, another open standard. So you can make pngWriter posts look however you want. I've experimented with the style used by NPR and the NYT for their pngWriter-like Twitter posts, for example.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/05.html#a040756" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

At that time I am playing the role of a support person. I don't mind doing it, but when I think about whether or not I want to create products for others to use, the totality of my personal experience with users is the biggest factor. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/05.html#a100750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100742"></a>If most of what I get back are requests to do <i>more</i> for them, a perspective that says "I am the customer and you are here to serve me," without anything coming back, well these days I don't bother shipping the product. I just create stuff for my own use. I've actually come to like that. Then I don't have to worry about what will users who pay no attention be able to figure out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/05.html#a100742" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100701"></a>Making software is very labor intensive hard stressful work. And the system is totally falling apart. Has been for a long time. If you want people to make new software for you, you should find ways to show appreciation and to help. These days users apply all the intellect our president applies to his job. If a mindless person can't understand your product, then don't bother. So I often don't bother.  No surprise there, right? If there's no reward, why keep banging your head against the wall?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/05.html#a100701" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100740"></a>Many developers say the same thing. Maybe what's needed is a better network of software developers. Maybe we should use each others' products so we can work to make them compatible? Maybe users can help spread the word about products they love so the size of the user bases can justify continued development? So there's some hope of some day getting compensation for the hard work we do?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/05.html#a100740" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
