I stumbled across this doc when I was looking for an explanation of guids for the <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a020936">piece</a> about the blog bugfix. The first part was so good, I wondered why I had no memory of it. Then I got to the second part. The attacks were ugly, personal and awful and that's what I had put out of my mind, and I never wanted to point to this piece for fear of inviting more abuse. But the <a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/stories/storyReader$1744#discontinuities">first</a> and <a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/stories/storyReader$1744#rss20AndWeblogSoftware">last</a> parts were good, and <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0</a> went on to be a juggernaut. And that's most of what I wanted. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a041022" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So if a post was created at 11<span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">:52:</span>02, its permalink would be 115202.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a020942" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a021111"></a>But my code was erroneously constructing the permalink by smashing together the hour, <i>month</i> (the error) and second. The month is the same for all posts published on the same day. And that meant that if one item were posted at 11<span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">:02:</span>53 and another at 11<span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">:17:</span>53 they would have the same permalink, 110753 (07 is the month). Not a huge problem except we use the permalink to form the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt">guid</a>, and that's what feed readers use to determine if an item is new or not. So the second item would be ignored, erroneously because it has the same guid as the first. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a021111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a021326"></a>The error probably happened a few times in the approximately two months I've been using the new <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&t=h_&ia=web">old school</a> system. It certainly happened yesterday (which is how I got on the trail of the bug). It was very deeply buried, but the rational code debugging method eventually revealed the problem and the fix for such problems is well-known. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a021326" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a022352"></a>How could one make such a mistake you might ask? A month and a minute, what do they have in common that could confuse a computer? Well, in the language of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dateformat">dateformat</a>, a package used to format dates, a month is noted as "mm" and the minute as "MM". So the errant programmer literally <i>asked</i> for the month by specifying the permalink as "ddmmss" when it should have been "ddMMss". This, my friends, is where the bug was buried. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a022352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a021428"></a>But! You can't just fix it. Because that would change the guids of all previous posts, potentially, and cause posts that have already been seen, many of them perhaps, to be seen as new by feed readers. People don't like it when your feed does that. So I left the bug as-is for posts before today, and all new posts have correctly formed permalinks. This is the first post with a correct permalink. Let's <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a020936">see</a> if it worked! :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a021428" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a041946"></a>PS: Yes it did. And the old links worked too. Whew.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a041946" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
