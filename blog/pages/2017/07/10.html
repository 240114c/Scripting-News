For example, the Internet is heavily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China">censored</a> in China. They also have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_China">death penalty</a>. Trials are short, constitutional protections non-existent. The dominant country tends to spread its values to the countries it dominates. They are in a position to demand it. The United States has been in that position for all the lives of everyone alive today. We don't know any other way. We are spoiled and lazy and are trying desperately to pay the price for it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a040748" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a055327"></a>Surprisingly, China has been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/13/business/worldbusiness/13sweat.html">boosting unions</a> and American <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/GLS_ChinaArticle.html">companies</a> have been fighting it. That's the opposite of what I thought was happening. Maybe Chinese domination would be better than I thought. (The American companies listed are Wal-Mart, Google, UPS, Microsoft, Nike, AT&T and Intel.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a055327" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a035636"></a>58% of Repubs <a href="https://www.axios.com/americans-divided-on-institutions-2456778828.html">think</a> higher education has a negative effect on the country. So how are those high-paying jobs going to stay in America if our people aren't educated? America seems to have a willed itself to fail. I don't see this as the country I grew up in.

If you don't like the way an item looks in the right panel, it's probably something you should report to the source of the feed, not me. We show you exactly what's in the feed. Unlike the main river display, we don't truncate or strip markup. You're getting what's in the feed, no more no less. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a011827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a011859"></a>An example of a feed that <a href="http://rss2.io/code/feedtools/feedviewer/?server=river5.scripting.com&url=http://feeds.feedburner.com/PoliticalWire">looks great</a> is Political Wire. Good length stories, not too much markup, links are included. I've always liked Political Wire, they summarize important political stories, and save you from having to click through a paywall to use up one of your monthly reads. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a011859" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arrington">Mike Arrington</a> at a meeting at a VC in NYC in 2005. I was living in Florida, and came up for the day. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Teare">Keith Teare</a>, who I knew from when I lived in the Valley, came out to NY and brought Mike, his partner in a startup called <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edgeio#/entity">Edgeio</a>. Mike was a lawyer. It was either at this meeting or some time soon after that I blurted out to Mike the thing that I said to pretty much everyone: "You should start a blog." Mike, being an <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html">NBB</a> got right to it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a064930" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a064959"></a>His blog, TechCrunch, consisted of writeups of products Mike had tried or companies he visited. There was a lot of activity in the Valley then, but it was hard to see. Mike made it visible. That's how powerful one person can be in the new age of publishing. (We're still in that age btw, you can do all that he did then, even more easily.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a064959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a065124"></a>Okay now here we are in 2017, and we're there again. I'm sure there's lots of stuff going on but we can't see it. For example, I shipped a simple product called <a href="http://pngwriter.com/">pngWriter</a> last week. It takes about five minutes to explore. If you want to fully grok it, and you know a little CSS, maybe it takes a half hour. Yet there is no writeup of the product outside of my blog. No place everyone can turn to to find some new stuff to try out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a065124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a065301"></a>No, I don't mean <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a>. It's nice. But it's so hyped up. I just want to know about products from a person like Mike who I get to know. Everyone was trying to shoot to the top of the list. I just want to know about new products. Not every new product. And I want opinion. I know he or she might not be right. And save the hype. Just tell me what's going on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a065301" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a065346"></a>I don't know who's going to do it. But someone please, if you have the time and a natural inclination to blog, and love the open web, give it a try. Let me know where to send readers and links to interesting products I discover. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a065346" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a065948"></a>PS: If you decide to do this, there will be assholes who try to get you down.

Maybe a couple of other people. You're hanging out in his back yard on a hot summer afternoon.
