<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a010439"></a>The Bay Area has a new <a href="https://www.fordgobike.com/how-it-works">bikeshare program</a>. Already operating in parts of San Francisco and the East Bay. San Jose coming. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a010439" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's the deal. Russia is run for the benefit of 44 people. They are the ones targeted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act">Magnitsky Act</a>. They hate it because what they're about first and foremost is making money for themselves. They don't care about Russia. So the deal they were proposing to DJT Jr was this. We win you the election and you kill the Magnitsky Act. We all plunder together. "Love it!" says Junior. And the US govt is now run for the benefit of the Trump Family. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's Razor</a> explanation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a023714" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a092641"></a>He said he likes the way <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> works now (I'd say <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">again</a>) and it's given him pause to think if maybe he should blog outside of Facebook too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a092641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a092709"></a>So here's what I want to say to Scoble. Why can't we have both? Why can't Facebook support the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html">basic features</a> of the web so we can post the same content to Facebook as we do on our blog. Make Facebook an excellent blogging surface. Really, a minor upgrade. That's the win-win. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a092709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a092819"></a>For a couple of years that's what I thought Facebook was doing and why I was excited about the future that would unlock for the web. But either they punted or misled. Either way Facebook is a bad web citizen. Sucking energy from the web and not feeding it back. It's as if you had a one-way peering arrangement. You have to take our packets but we won't carry yours. That's not net-neutral (and why I don't support them in their fight against Verizon and Comcast).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a092819" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a093434"></a>It's the analog of constructing private apartment buildings in Central Park. Not only isn't it fair or moral, it's also stupid. When you're done, no one will want to live there. To this day Facebook feeds off the web. When the web is exhausted, maybe then Facebook will support linking in their discussion posts. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a093434" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a093016"></a>I've tried over and over to get people <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">inside</a> and outside of Facebook to understand why we need Facebook to relent, but I don't think they get it. This is one of those things you won't know you'll miss until it's too late. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a093016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a094922"></a>PS: Just four <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html">features</a>: 1. Links. 2. Simple styling. 3. Enclosures for podcasting. 4. Titles. They already have the code written, they just have to deploy it for <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=peon">regular users</a> like you, Scoble and me.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a094922" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

On Facebook I'm just a user. That was/is one of the great things about the web. Anyone can develop features for it. On Facebook, just their employees can. No wonder it never moves.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a094622" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a094656"></a>When a company dominates an activity, they tend to invest elsewhere. Seems kind of perverse, but that's why markets don't always evolve to fill every niche. Open platforms are more favorable. If you want to perform a new style of music in Central Park, you can. If you want to do it in Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center, you need to get the approval of a lot of rich people.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a094656" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a092036"></a>If China is going to be the new world-dominant country, we should familiarize ourselves with how things might change for us personally. There probably is some good to it. For example, we'd be likely to get back on track re climate change. But we might not adapt so well to the Chinese citizen's lifestyle. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/11.html#a092036" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
