It would be a fascinating new media way to cover this story, to make it understandable and interesting.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a080855"></a>Net neutrality is an issue for a set of big companies relative to another set. Users don't have a reason to support one over the other. Neither group has made a pitch to users that mean anything other than more control of the net by big companies. The tech industry has fooled you if you think they're your friends. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/12.html#a080855" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

My guess is she did. In June 2016, Trump has the nomination. Putin knows he can't work with Clinton. <i>He wants the sanctions lifted. </i>They already have the Democratic emails. How to monetize them? This meeting probably was among the first official meetings between Russia and Trump. Trump had been meeting with Russian surrogates for months, perhaps unknowingly. But this was official. The lawyer listened, heard what Trump wants and they gave it to him. Remember the emails <i>did</i> leak. That's what Junior said he wanted. Now you have to connect the dots. Find more meetings later in the summer and into the fall. Collusion is hardly the issue. Whether they broke the law, not the issue. <i>They sold out our country. </i>That should piss everyone off. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/12.html#a081008" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Okay, if you want to do it -- then do it. That's how this works.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/12.html#a091439" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091504"></a> I recommend starting by going through products that associate themselves with the #indieweb. Review them, one at a time, based on actual use. Use them as a user would. Don't try to say what you think I want you to say, say what you see and think. How well do they interop? Do they deliver on the <i>indie</i>ness? How could they improve? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/12.html#a091504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
