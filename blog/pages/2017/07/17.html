Good idea. Perhaps go the next step, find thoughtful people everywhere to write about what's wrong with the world, and listen. A lot is lost when you have to explain things through reporters. We're limited by what they understand. As a result events fly by without much understanding. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/17.html#a010400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a014222"></a>I hear the Democrats <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2017/07/17/democrats-still-divided-message/">need</a> a core message, how about: "We love America and Americans and the Constitution and we're <i>fighting</i> for all of it." Or hot dogs, baseball and apple pie, or you could do that in the background with farm pictures, subways and highways full of cars. Mountains, the Grand Canyon and the Florida Keys too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/17.html#a014222" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a050338"></a>Why don't the Democrats hold a contest among the people for the new message of the party.

I knew I had a contact lens floating around somewhere in my right eye, outside my vision. I couldn't feel where it was, and no amount of tweaking would get it to re-center. So finally I decided it must have fallen out, and put in a second lens. Then I could <i>really</i> feel something was wrong. So I took out the second lens and miraculously the one I thought had fallen out came back into view, and my vision was back to where it was supposed to be. But I wondered what I would do if I never found the first lens and had to live with the possibility that I had it floating around inside there, getting infected and fused and whatever contacts lost in your body do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/17.html#a122505" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
