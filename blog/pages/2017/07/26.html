<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a102647"></a>A reporter is trying to squeeze an oral history out of me re podcasting in 2003-04. I'm driving her crazy. Wish they had a reporter covering us 14 years ago while it was happening! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/26.html#a102647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a053711"></a>I'm doing some work with <a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever">forever</a>, the utility that keeps a set of Node apps running. I want to be able to get a list of the running processes from within an app that builds on <a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever-monitor">forever-monitor</a>, which is forever's core functionality. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever-monitor/issues/149">question</a> I asked. Any help much appreciated. ;-) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/26.html#a053711" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/07/26/citibike.png"><a name="a054215"></a><img src="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/07/26/citibike.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I picked up a CitiBike this afternoon and it wasn't properly docked. I could have taken it home and no one would have known. I imagine the poor person who thought they docked it was wondering what would happen. Would they end up owning the bike? No worries, I docked the bike for them, after taking it to my destination. Everyone wins. I got a free ride. Well I would have gotten a free ride anyway, because I have an unlimited card. But I still feel like I won! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ‘®</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/26.html#a054215" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a071525"></a>#rex tells me that CitiBike has GPS built-in. How does that work. Is it always broadcasting its position back to the home office? Also there's a new <a href="http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2017/07/25/could-dockless-bike-share-rival-be-coming-to-nyc-.html">dockless bike sharing</a> program coming to NYC, to compete with CitiBike. Competition is good! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/26.html#a071525" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a113059"></a>An August 2003 <a href="http://scripting.com/2003/08/22.html">post</a> about how Chris Lydon covered a Howard Dean campaign event in Manchester, NH. A confluence of politics, journalism, podcasting and a technology that was nothing more than a vision, and <i>all of it ended up mattering. </i> It doesn't often work out that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/26.html#a113059" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Pictures from the NH field trips were there (pointed to from Betsy's blog). Archive.org <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031002232528/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/picsEdwardsDeanNH">has</a> the page, but many of the pictures are missing. But the pictures themselves are <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/static/bloggerCon/">preserved</a>. The ones of the campaign events begin with DSC. However I thought all the original blogs at Harvard were preserved? This is not a good sign. There was a fair amount of history preserved there. It was an academic project, so it's not cool that our work is gone. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/26.html#a120346" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
