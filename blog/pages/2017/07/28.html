There will be many bugs. And lots of features to add. This is just the beginning. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/28.html#a050544" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a082559"></a>I've been reading archives of <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> from the early-mid 00's to get an idea of how I was using the format that now I'm once again using. Tripped over <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/09.html#myTwoCentsOnPodcast">this post</a> where I say <i>podcast</i> is a good name for what we're doing. It's actually a good piece and should be part of the record of the evolution of podcasting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/28.html#a082559" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

			<li><a name="a075457"></a>McCain isn't going to run for re-election in 2022. He's 80 with bad cancer. So the usual thing that makes Repubs follow the leadership don't apply. He could afford to be a maverick, where his mavericky buddies Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul et al are planning to run again, maybe even for higher office, and will need support from Republican billionaire Russian backers.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/28.html#a075457" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a075705"></a>This could all have been theater, to some extent it certainly was. McConnell and Ryan are not idiots. They understood what would happen if this crazy bullshit became law. Chaos. Real Americans dying. Lots of them. And it's hard to see how they would avoid being blamed for it. So if you need an out, but want to make it look like you tried, you get three independent Repubs to take the fall, in return for some future favor, and act all pouty like "What a mess, we tried, we really did, now let's go sailing and camping and on wine tasting tours."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/28.html#a075705" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
