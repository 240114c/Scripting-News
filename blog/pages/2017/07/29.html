I knew the guy when he was very young relative to what he is today which is unspeakably old. I remember when my grandfather was 70 and I thought holy shit that guy is old. Of course I've gotten older too as Doc has aged. But I try not to think about that. Instead I think of how old Doc has gotten. A real shame. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">☔️</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/29.html#a081939" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Already there were signs of independence in the party, like the three senators who voted against their "health care" bill. And the veto-proof sanctions bill. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/29.html#a012249" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a012415"></a>Something I've been saying and no one has been believing is that the idea of what it means to be a Republican and Democrat is in flux. The question of which party is the majority party is up for grabs. The president has a huge chunk of the electorate if you view it as separate from the Republican Party. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perot">Ross Perot</a>. But this time Perot won. The old Republican Party, the one Trump is splitting off of is smaller, at least for now, it seems to me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/29.html#a012415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a012539"></a>There are a lot of new faces in the Repub Party, people who used to be regional who are now developing a national presence, beyond the bomb-throwers like Ted Cruz and the <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/07/29/mcClown.jpg">clowns</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9H5SOl86Ac">comedians</a> like Lindsey Graham and John McCain. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/29.html#a012539" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a012703"></a>I wonder how many in Congress will go with the president where ever he's going. And what of the military and the police. The boy scouts. The man is recruiting his army and his secret police perhaps? It feels like we're back to where we were before January 20. Things had become kind of lulled unsettling, we were all getting on with our lives somewhat. Now it's about to get hairy again. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/29.html#a012703" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
