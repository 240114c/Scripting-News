It has the advantage of being with me almost all the time. It's kind of like the best camera is the one you have with you when you want to take a picture. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/30.html#a101859" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I suspect when the story reaches equilibrium, i.e. no more major characters added to the plot, it'll turn out that TCF and the Russian Mob are one and the same. But who knows. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/30.html#a100056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100517"></a>When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> reached a certain point they needed to create a permanent resource called <a href="https://crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase</a>, one page per company with the date founded, sources of capital, products, founders, and when they were acquired, for how much, or went public. We need that for the Trumps. Different stats, like when they first met with the Russian ambassador, testified before Congress, were indicted, convicted, committed suicide or were murdered, etc. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/30.html#a100517" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
