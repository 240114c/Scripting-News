		<li><a name="a090647"></a>I've gotten in the habit of watching two hours of GoT on Sunday night. First I watch the previous episode a second time at 8PM and then the new one at 9PM. The 8PM show was not quite as awful as I remembered. Lots of speeches as characters who had never met explain themselves. The writing was awful, stiff and unnecessary. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/31.html#a090647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090821"></a>But this week, they skip a lot of steps as I wish they had with the previous episode and right at the beginning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen">Mother of Dragons</a> meets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Snow_(character)">Jon Snow</a> and <i>they are great</i> together. Something like <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-know-nothing-jon-snow">Ygritte</a> and Jon Snow. Real chemistry. All of a sudden Daenerys Stormborn has met her match. I was totally afraid Jon Snow was going to bend the knee, but a guy who's been resurrected probably thinks about these things differently. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üëº</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/31.html#a090821" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091002"></a>There's one moment where Khaleesi dismisses him, and I could hear the voice of Ygritte. Jon Snow get on with it, is not too far from Jon Snow you know nothing. It had an erotic feel. At that moment I almost tweeted a question, do you think they'll be in bed before the end of this episode or the next? Or will the season end with them in bed. And what about the moment when they realize that the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms is really Jon Snow's auntie. Haha. They're going to do this well. They're not going to blow it. This is the moment we're all waiting for. Don't. Blow. It.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/31.html#a091002" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

The one I know is a spineless spitballer who, when the economy melted down while he was running for president suspended his campaign and then had no idea what to do. So he called a huge meeting at the White House, and he still had no clue, so Barack Obama took charge and told everyone what to do, and basically told them the right things. McCain makes a big deal about supposedly being a straight-talker, but he's lazy and he's mostly a self-admiring cowardly bullshitter. Maybe he showed true grit when he was in the Navy, but as a politician he's strictly a bench warmer, not a leader. Also everyone conveniently forgets he was caught in a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keating_Five">bank scandal</a> in the 80s.

Just had a remarkable programming session. At the beginning of the session I had a nice <a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar">chokidar</a>-based image uploader app in Node. I wanted to get started at putting it into an Electron shell. A couple of hours and it's done. There's an image that was uploaded with it in the right margin. The cool thing is that it hooks into the OS, no polling, so there's zero latency. Drop an image in the folder and it's up before you can bring the app to the front. Debugged a race condition, a file deleted before it was read, and then realized I had two copies of the app running. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/23.html#a104559" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's no longer interesting to me. We're looping around and around. It's the same story. Trump was and is in the money laundering business. They operate in the open, just lie about it. No coincidence the same people in the June 2016 meeting are turning out to have relationships with Trump and his team as well as Putin and his. They're all part of the same effort. Trump is so happy to meet Putin and hang with him because he's the boss's boss's boss. We can all see Trump is both crazy and subordinate to Putin. The only story left to tell here is when are the Repubs going to do something about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/21.html#a014912" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a070815"></a>For the first part, I used Google Movies to find out what was available, so I might not know what movie I want to see. But today I know what movie I want to see:  Dunkirk. So how do I search for all theaters in Manhattan that are showing that movie, and the showtimes, and the address of the theater.

Impossible to get the info you need, and it's incredibly slow. There must be a money-making reason for it. It makes it hard to find a movie in a theater to watch. To just daydream about what's available. Sometimes I used to go to a movie just because there was nothing else that interested me. I never do that anymore because they make it so hard to scan the listings. This, from an industry who feels imperiled by Netflix and piracy. Please. How much could it cost to solve this problem?

And the end of Season 1 is a basic primer on the logic of the titular game. Cersei and Ned do a demo with help from Kings Robert and Joffrey and the rest of the cast. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/15.html#a031433" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a025851"></a>Then there's the question of who is <s>my favorite</s> the best <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=game+of+thrones+characters&t=hy&ia=web">character</a>? There are so many great ones. Obviously all the main characters, Daenerys, Jon Snow, Cersei, Jamie, Tyrion, Sansa, Arya, Ned Stark, it's impossible to pick one. So it has to be a supporting character. If I had to choose a male and female, I'd go with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton">Ramsay Bolton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ygritte">Ygritte</a>, for opposite reasons. Ramsay is the purest of evil. So entertaining. You always want to know what he's up to now, even though you might have to avert your eyes. And Ygritte, because I am totally head over heels in love with her. I would love love love to hear her say <i>You know nothing Dave Winer. </i><span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üí•</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/15.html#a025851" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a093139"></a>Think about Medium this way. It's a big public <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22legal+pad%22&t=hq&ia=web">legal pad</a>. In a perfect world, no one owns the pad. When you want to write something you tear off a sheet, write, when you're done you tack it up to a global bulletin board where everyone can see it. Search engines can add it to their indices. People can find it. Forever. You can put something on the record, without having to "start" a blog. This has a different feel from starting a blog, which to many people feels like a committment to write regularly, an obligation. This is for the one-off, I have to say something now, post. It has a place in the world of public writing. Ghost is not such a place, and neither is WordPress.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/15.html#a093139" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a093552"></a>I've long felt that tying a business model to a global writing pad inevitably leads to it becoming something else. And eventually to the writing disappearing from the web.

Urgently, because every day we don't do it is a day that may be lost to history. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/15.html#a093552" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

He says Russia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">loves</a> your dad, wants to see him elected, can we meet to discuss? Junior loves it. They get together. Seal the deal. The Russian rep doesn't talk much, asks what Junior and Kushner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-incrimination">want</a>. Manafort is sitting on both sides of the table (possibly unbeknownst to Junior and Kushner) but mostly on the Russian side, of course. BTW, you can be sure the Russians have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat">recording</a> of what was said at this meeting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html#a085508" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a085646"></a>Follow-up meetings take place. They introduce people in both organizations to each other. There are lots of connections at all levels through the campaign. The tracks are not well covered. And of course Russians have copies of all the emails (as they had copies of the ones that just leaked). When Flynn was fired because he could be blackmailed that must have been a good laugh for Trump et al, because that was the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html#a085646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a085948"></a>Anyway, this seems to be "the arc" of the relationship between Trump and Russia. Both countries are now controlled by the mob. They don't care if we know. It's all pretty much out in the open and all that the Russians care about is that their money-laundering <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate">flows</a> are turned back on. They don't care about the other things we thought they might care about. The US can do whatever they want. They just want to be able to continue to use American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaires%27_Row_(Manhattan)">real estate</a> as their piggybank.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html#a085948" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

My guess is she did. In June 2016, Trump has the nomination. Putin knows he can't work with Clinton. <i>He wants the sanctions lifted. </i>They already have the Democratic emails. How to monetize them? This meeting probably was among the first official meetings between Russia and Trump. Trump had been meeting with Russian surrogates for months, perhaps unknowingly. But this was official. The lawyer listened, heard what Trump wants and they gave it to him. Remember the emails <i>did</i> leak. That's what Junior said he wanted. Now you have to connect the dots. Find more meetings later in the summer and into the fall. Collusion is hardly the issue. Whether they broke the law, not the issue. <i>They sold out our country. </i>That should piss everyone off. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/12.html#a081008" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

For example, the Internet is heavily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China">censored</a> in China. They also have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_China">death penalty</a>. Trials are short, constitutional protections non-existent. The dominant country tends to spread its values to the countries it dominates. They are in a position to demand it. The United States has been in that position for all the lives of everyone alive today. We don't know any other way. We are spoiled and lazy and are trying desperately to pay the price for it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a040748" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arrington">Mike Arrington</a> at a meeting at a VC in NYC in 2005. I was living in Florida, and came up for the day. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Teare">Keith Teare</a>, who I knew from when I lived in the Valley, came out to NY and brought Mike, his partner in a startup called <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edgeio#/entity">Edgeio</a>. Mike was a lawyer. It was either at this meeting or some time soon after that I blurted out to Mike the thing that I said to pretty much everyone: "You should start a blog." Mike, being an <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html">NBB</a> got right to it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a064930" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a064959"></a>His blog, TechCrunch, consisted of writeups of products Mike had tried or companies he visited. There was a lot of activity in the Valley then, but it was hard to see. Mike made it visible. That's how powerful one person can be in the new age of publishing. (We're still in that age btw, you can do all that he did then, even more easily.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a064959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a065124"></a>Okay now here we are in 2017, and we're there again. I'm sure there's lots of stuff going on but we can't see it. For example, I shipped a simple product called <a href="http://pngwriter.com/">pngWriter</a> last week. It takes about five minutes to explore. If you want to fully grok it, and you know a little CSS, maybe it takes a half hour. Yet there is no writeup of the product outside of my blog. No place everyone can turn to to find some new stuff to try out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/10.html#a065124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

And I want opinion. I know he or she might not be right. And save the hype.

So if a post was created at 11<span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">:52:</span>02, its permalink would be 115202.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a020942" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a021111"></a>But my code was erroneously constructing the permalink by smashing together the hour, <i>month</i> (the error) and second.

And that meant that if one item were posted at 11<span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">:02:</span>53 and another at 11<span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">:17:</span>53 they would have the same permalink, 110753 (07 is the month). Not a huge problem except we use the permalink to form the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt">guid</a>, and that's what feed readers use to determine if an item is new or not. So the second item would be ignored, erroneously because it has the same guid as the first. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/09.html#a021111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a022352"></a>How could one make such a mistake you might ask? A month and a minute, what do they have in common that could confuse a computer? Well, in the language of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dateformat">dateformat</a>, a package used to format dates, a month is noted as "mm" and the minute as "MM".

Because that would change the guids of all previous posts, potentially, and cause posts that have already been seen, many of them perhaps, to be seen as new by feed readers. People don't like it when your feed does that. So I left the bug as-is for posts before today, and all new posts have correctly formed permalinks. This is the first post with a correct permalink.

		<li><a name="a110736"></a>Dave was a campaigner. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/technology/david-bunnell-dead.html">kind</a> <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=David+Bunnell&t=h_&ia=web">of</a> <a href="https://www.edge.org/digerati/bunnell/">person</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/David-Bunnell/e/B001KCOHMY">who</a> always had something that he was trying to get the world to do. When I first met him it was personal computers. He was founding editor of PC Magazine, and famously left, with most of his staff, to found PC World, over a dispute with the publishers. He did a deal with Steve Jobs to do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macworld">magazine</a> for the Mac, it shipped the day the Mac was announced. There was a copy of the first edition on every seat in Flint Center on 1/24/84.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/08.html#a110736" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120727"></a>I met up with him again when I moved to Berkeley in 2005. He had retired from the magazine business, and now was writing and speaking about being active in old age. Then last year he got pancreatic cancer, and within months he died.  He had just finished a book. Was about to go out on tour when the disease hit. All that was put aside. He wondered what would happen with his causes after he was gone, I heard. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/08.html#a120727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120704"></a>I think about my dead relatives and their causes. My uncle Ken designed a windmill that captured wind from any direction. My father wanted to help businesses make smarter decisions. Both of their work, their life causes, are not even footnotes. And even if they had set the world on fire, so what?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/08.html#a120704" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120719"></a>Of course I too am a campaigner and I'm still alive. When I'm gone, my campaigns will be forgotten. They already are. I gave a talk about the origins of podcasting at a podcasting conference in April. Someone said it had never occured to them that someone must have invented it. And here I was thinking they all were reverent of the genius of the simplicity and how much it had grown and managed to stay out of the control of the tech industry, so far at least. Apparently I'm one of very few people who are even aware that there was an act of creation, much less understood the miracle of its growth and utility, and independence. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/08.html#a120719" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

The southern slave states had low population agrarian economies, unlike the more urban northern states. If representation in Congress were proportional to population, slavery would have been outlawed at founding, even though (I learned later, after going through the NYC public school system) northern states participated in and profited from the slave trade. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/07.html#a120741" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120728"></a>The compromise was that every state, no matter how small its population, got two votes in the Senate.

This suggests that perhaps the first step toward recovery may be that everyone who wants to be part of the open web but for now is spending most of their time in Facebook, should at least have one public page <i>outside</i> Facebook that says how to contact them. So I could point to that page. It would <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nakedjen&t=h_&ia=web">show up</a> in search engines. And Jen would know to check from time to time to see if there were incoming messages from other people on the open web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/02.html#a080707" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

This is something I've never experienced personally, because I was never a VC and am not a woman. But I did live in the valley between 1979 and 2003.

Guys, if the woman is talking about her business ideas, that means it isn't about sex, no matter where it is. You need to hear that and respect it. A meeting in a business setting, a conference room at an office for example, is business. Flirting and sex talk, even complimenting a woman on her appearance is not OK. Don't do it.

He asks "How many people programming these have any idea what that means?"

		<li><a name="a110739"></a>Does it really matter if people know the derivation? Think of all the non-English speakers who learn the names for concepts that came from English-speaking countries. The words are just words, they have no meaning beyond their functionality.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/01.html#a110739" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a110753"></a>Further, when something has a name that everyone knows why not keep using it? Why are the foot controls in cars the same today as they were when I learned to drive in the seventies? Look at all the change that's happened in cars since then. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/01.html#a110753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

There's no wall on Wall St. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(Manhattan)">Broadway</a> is an anglicized version of a Dutch name believe it or not, not descriptive. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/01.html#a110727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a110739"></a>So much change in tech is just coming up with new names for well-understood concepts. I have friends I use to help translate. It's a job security thing. Full employment for programmers. But on the whole it's not a good idea. Keeps us from building.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/01.html#a110739" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
