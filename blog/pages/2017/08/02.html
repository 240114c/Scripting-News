Actually two. One for my servers and one for me personally. I pay $99 per year for each. No way to avoid it. Each has a 1TB limit, but actually use less than 100GB. The servers update files a lot, so there's lots of traffic on my Dropbox account. I don't begrudge them $200 a year. They provide a lot of service for the money.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082003" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082015"></a>In early May I reprovisioned my desktop Mac because the machine was performing badly, and I couldn't figure why. So I bought a 5TB external drive, and put everything vital on it, including my Dropbox folder. That was probably a mistake. Because you can hear that drive doing its thing all the time night and day. And then the machine started getting slow. Again. Rainbow cursors. Just like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY60vzAWqxw">Mac ad</a> that shows the PC going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland">Never-Land</a>, except it's my Mac that's doing it. Programming or writing under these circumstances is like having random <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=senior%20moment">Senior Moments</a>, which I unfortunately now have for real (I'm 62). A random computer-induced Senior Moment. Ugh. Just what I need! (Not.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082402"></a>So on Monday morning I decided it was time to move my Dropbox folder from the external drive to my unused 1TB internal drive. First there was a permissions problem. Fixed that. Then it took a good 24 hours to move the folder! All the while the computer was unusable. So I used my laptop and surprisingly got a lot of good work done. I should probably go on a trip. Anyway..<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082402" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082528"></a>Now everything's done, but Dropbox is downloading the whole folder again, for what reason exactly? As of last night it had over 600K files to download. This morning when I start work it's still got <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/08/02/dropboxSync.png">over 400K</a>. What the fuck Dropbox. What was the point of taking 24 hours to move the folder if you just have to re-download everything all over again?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082643"></a>Anyway, one of the advantages of being a senior is that I will forget all this soon enough. And because I'm a senior, I'm laughing out loud while I write this. Cackling really. This is what happens when you get old. Your mind and body fall apart but your sense of humor gets really sharp! God is merciful. Also the programming project I'm working on is truly wonderful. Open source software makes all kinds of things possible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
