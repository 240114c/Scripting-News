Murphy-willing I'm going to be writing each of them up, in turn, <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/">here</a> on Scripting News. You'll recognize the functionality as the kind of stuff you need to build DaveLand on the Internets in Node. The first one up is a really good OPML-to-and-from-JavaScript package. Naturally this stuff will mostly be of interest to developers and people who might want to become one.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a122101" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125334"></a>The way you know podcasting isn't dominated by anyone is at the end of every podcast. There is no single place to go to hear a podcast.

I use their stuff as a reference all the time for net programming. I was looking at their new <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/">tutorial</a> for Node.js and on the first page they repeat the hype about Node that I've always suspected was BS, and now that I have a few years in, I know it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015252"></a>Node is a fine environment, I use it as my main server runtime, and lately I've been <a href="http://this.how/electricRiver/">building</a> a lot with <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, and there you're using Node on the desktop. I have a love-hate relationship with Node, I'm a prisoner to some bad design imho but it's great to have one syntax instead of two for client and server apps. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015252" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015424"></a>But other environments like Java and Python are probably just as efficient as Node <i>without all the crazy callbacks. </i>Their runtimes can suspend a process until its I/O completes. All the other languages/environments do that. It is not something that only Node does. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015513"></a>And Node is not single-threaded! You have many threads. A single-threaded server runtime is impossible. That's one of the reasons I strongly suspected all the hype when I was new to Node.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015513" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015554"></a>The difference between Node and other environments is that the others hide the suspending and resuming of your app behind an abstraction layer, <i>and that's good, </i>that makes your code <i>much</i> simpler. In every way imho the way JavaScript does I/O is a major step backwards. But like I said I love/hate JS. I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">made my peace</a> with the <a href="http://callbackhell.com/">way</a> I/O works in Node. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üçë</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015554" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
