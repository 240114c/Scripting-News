They can't handle news like  the <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2017/08/08/trump-issues-threat-north-korea/">escalation</a> that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/08/08/trump-vows-north-korea-will-be-met-with-fire-and-fury-if-threats-continue/">Trump</a> took in possible nuclear war with <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/reports-north-korea-produced-nuclear-warhead-fits-in-missile">North Korea</a>. There really isn't anything else to talk about now. It doesn't matter what the president's approval rating is or whether Congress will flip in 2018. The president did something you can't do: openly, publicly, threatening to nuke North Korea. Now he has no good choices. Obviously if he launches nukes unprovoked, there's a good chance China or someone else will nuke us back. You think they'd just sit still for that? Or he has to back down. Great. Now what. There goes the nuclear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory">deterrent</a>, not just with North Korea but with Pakistan, India, all the other countries that have nukes but haven't announced. The current format of news, amped-up sensationalism about trivia, doesn't scale to this level. <i>We need a new kind of news, right now. </i>I will try Maddow later. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/08.html#a070141" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They know when you're doing well, and if they like your business they could launch a brand that competes, and give themselves a better deal of course. This is factored into development everywhere. There are lots of projects I won't do because it's a lot of work, but much easier for a BigCo, so when and if I prove the idea makes money, they'll just take it over. Even when you don't make money sometimes they take it over. The biggest hole in the market is a complete user data <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/19">storage system</a> that's as easy to authorize as Twitter or Facebook. Totally doable. For some reason no BigCo will do it.

This is a bit of miserably prejudiced nonsense, as crazy as any thought as anyone has ever been fired for. What he really means: He doesn't think Trump will change (I don't either, but I have been surprised) so he slammed a whole class of innocent people, many of who <i>do</i> change after 70.
