Now in August they're tearing it down. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/11.html#a091104" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a090528"></a>As the war situation gets worse, the thought of Trump supporters going crazy with their guns seems tame. The NRA needs to get them nukes.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/11.html#a090528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a025225"></a>Think about offering Trump a few billion dollars to resign. Most presidents would be insulted, but I have a feeling Trump would be tempted.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/11.html#a025225" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a112527"></a>During the campaign Trump very openly said he might use nuclear weapons. That disqualified him to be the person who decides when to use them. Yet here we are. It was 100 percent predictable we'd be where we are now. And it's  likely to get even worse. It's hard to see how we come back from this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/11.html#a112527" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a092410"></a>When I started programming seriously in JavaScript, I did what a lot of programmers do, I started a <i>utils</i> file where I put all the general-purpose routines I like to have around. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/11.html#a092410" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a092456"></a>That's what <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveutils">daveutils</a> is. An NPM package of handy JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/master/daveutils.js">functions</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/11.html#a092456" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a092456"></a>Frontier programmers will find these functions immediately familiar. They are borrowed from the builtin verb set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software">Frontier</a>. And of course those routines were borrowed from the programming I did on the Mac before there was a Frontier. So these names go a long way back. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/11.html#a092456" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
