I've thought about this, as has everyone else, for a long time. Read a bunch of stuff. Listened. Discussed. And I have two takeaways.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/12.html#a102732" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

			<li><a name="a102744"></a>Accept it. North Korea has nuclear weapons. and can deliver them anywhere in the world at any time. It's time for the world to transition. Accept North Korea as a nuclear power. Have a bar mitzvah for Kim Jong Un. Say a prayer. Wish Kim Jong Un well. He's a man. Welcome North Korea to the league of nations.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/12.html#a102744" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a102840"></a>Embrace the people of North Korea as citizens of the world, our equals. To survive they have to trust us, and like it or not we have to trust them. In the meantime, send them all our programming. Starbucks. Amazon. HBO. JavaScript. YouTube. Eventually they will exert power over their leadership. Hope they have better judgement than the voters of the United States.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/12.html#a102840" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
