<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a020526"></a>Another good day of programming. Still working on <a href="http://instantdave.com/">Instant Dave</a>.  Lots more functionality in the second iteration. One thing I must have is the ability to update. If an item on my blog updates, it must also update in the Instant Dave interface. I often edit after I post initially. Correct spelling, tighten up the wording. Add links. These should all flow through to the people who are reading my stuff in Instant Dave. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/16.html#a020526" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

With dread I turned on MSNBC at 6PM and watched. When they started airing his full press conference I switched to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order">Law & Order</a> rerun. By the time Maddow was over it was just one more thing. She did run a clip of Fox, when first processing the press conference. It was cause for hope. But of course by the morning I'm sure they've reconnected with their bosses, found their spin, and are ready for another day of look-away.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/16.html#a083724" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
