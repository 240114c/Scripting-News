<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125850"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/pbump">Philip Bump</a>, a friend from <i>Ye Earlie Blogging Dayse</i> did a <a href="https://twitter.com/trumps_feed">bot</a> that RTs everything Donald Trump sees in his Twitter timeline. No wonder the guy is so hyper (Trump, not Bump). This led me to a business model that Trump himself would appreciate. Let me buy ads aimed at a specific user. Let's load up Trump's timeline with messages of Trump-Love. We love you Dear Leader. We love you <i>soooo</i> much. And then tell him what we want him to do. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a125850" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I still do it. Have to. Because projects are like pies. They aren't ready for eating until they've had a chance to cool off on the counter a while. While that's happening I like to still be "there" and ready to tune things up here and there, to make things work more smoothly. And when the time feels right, go back to the pies I left on the counter a month or two ago. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üçÑ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a121358" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a110957"></a>I shifted my approach to development a few months back, with the turn to Old School, and decided to build where the users were going. Scripting News was still getting most of the flow, despite all my efforts to create new more compelling flows. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a110957" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a111055"></a>Another shift happened a few years ago, when I decided it was okay to develop just for myself, with no intention of ever releasing the stuff I was working on. That led to a new style of product, and a happier developer. I was always doing it for myself, and fooling myself into believing it was for other people. I'm no less a narcissist than anyone else. Once you own that, you get a lot more powerful, I have found. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üöÄ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a111055" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And that does not include Slack. Now look at the Activity Monitor in the Dock. Very little resource utilization. A bunch of Electron apps sitting there doing nothing doesn't use very much CPU. Here's a <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/08/17/activityMonitor.png">screen shot</a> of the Activity Monitor window. Dropbox is using 34 percent. After that, a lot of Chrome helpers and a few of the Electron apps. The most expensive is about the same as iTunes. Today's machines have lots of memory and very capable CPUs. Electron is not the issue. I'm sure some of the apps written in Electron suck, but that's not the fault of the platform. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a055530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

One thing that's always been a concern of mine about RSS is the inability to update a post after it's been published.

		<li><a name="a095111"></a>But in the new scheme I'm creating, called for now <i>Instant Dave</i> just to keep it manageable in my head, not only are updates instantaneous but if I update a post, it flows back out to the subscribers at the same instant rate that new items go out, at the same rate that new posts go to Twitter and Facebook.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/17.html#a095111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
