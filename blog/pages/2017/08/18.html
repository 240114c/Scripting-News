I'm guessing most of them come from Staten Island and New Jersey, maybe some from out on the Island. Tomorrow also is the final <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/home/home.shtml">Summer Streets</a> bike ride from 7AM to 1PM starting at Park Ave and 72nd St, through 4th Ave and onto Lafayette St, to the Brooklyn Bridge. Nazis coming by car should be aware that there will be limited cross-town access. Anyway, Summer Streets riders end up pretty close to Washington Square Park which tomorrow is Nazi-Land in NYC.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a032640" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Until this weekend, Nazis and the KKK were unimportant fringe groups. This is no longer true. This is the United States, our world leadership is <i>based on</i> our defeating the Nazis in World War II. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a115415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Right off the bat you know it's bullshit, because if it were a real security issue, how could they justify waiting until October?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a085700" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a085751"></a>Here's the story. At one time I had my own search engine because Google wasn't yet doing a great job of indexing blogs. There was a small search form on every page. The archive pages from the blog in this period, in 2006, eleven years ago, are still there. Here are <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/10.html">the</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/09.html">examples</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/07/18.html">they</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/11.html">cited</a>. The forms don't work, the search engine is long-gone. They're afraid someone will type their SSN in that form and it will be observed and recorded by an intermediary. On a decade-old archive page.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a085751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091555"></a>Don't worry. The pages aren't going anywhere and I'm not modifying them. I try to keep the archive of this blog intact and unmodified. It serves not only as record of the events on the blog, but also the technology of the blog. If you've read this site at all you'd know it was central to the development of blogging and other technologies. The blog's HTML and scripts are part of the record. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a091555" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090005"></a>I have an uncountable number of domains I have used over the years. I try to keep the sites running to the best of my ability. I've been doing this since 1994. Converting them all to HTTPS isn't going to happen unless HTTPS becomes much more manageable. And as I've explained <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+https+google+mozilla+eff&t=hy&ia=web">many times</a> here, I like storing my blog content on Amazon S3, and HTTPS and S3 are not happy partners, if you want to use your own domain name, which of course I do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a090005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090153"></a>Google will lie <i>about security</i> to accomplish a strategic objective. And a lot of people will believe them when they say <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> is a bad site. But over time, if they abuse the trust, they will lose it. That's the way this works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a090153" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090254"></a>They've certainly lost me. I don't trust Google even a bit. They don't own the web, they didn't create it, and I'm not going to submit to them. If you can't read this site with Chrome, so be it. That's their choice. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a090254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090417"></a>I think the EFF should stand up for the rights of individual bloggers vs the giant corporation, but don't hold your breath. EFF is funded by Google. Same old shit, just a different industry. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/18.html#a090417" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
