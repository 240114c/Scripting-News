I was regularly pointing to Doc from my <a href="http://scripting.com/">blog</a>, because his writing was so good and perspectives about the net so valuable. Six months. You have to show people steadiness. Update even if they aren't reading in the numbers you'd like. Keep doing it. It takes time to build up a trust, a pattern, a habit. And that's what reading a blog is, a habit. Conclusion: If there's a will to reboot blogging, we have to create that kind of habit, across a number of sites. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/22.html#a094853" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He says he's a liberal, but his <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/alan-dershowitz-liberals-in-statue-debate-doing-what-stalin-did/">words</a> are Republican. I should explain what that means. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üçé</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/22.html#a091742" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091959"></a>There's a dishonest debating style that Repubs use, never heard a Democrat use it. They go on about how unfair it is for some Democrat to do X, Y and Z. They are things that are obviously unfair. He keeps going. Lots of examples. Of things that never happened. You nod your head. Those disgusting Democrats. What awful people. Such hypocrites. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/22.html#a091959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a095930"></a>You have to be very circumspect when listening to a Repub like Dershowitz. Ask yourself each time he declares something a Demo did. Did they do it? Probably not. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/22.html#a095930" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a092224"></a>People who work for BigTechCo's use this technique too. It can be pretty egregious. People assume if you work for a famous company You Must Know. They take advantage of this, and say things that are not true knowing you'll probably believe them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/22.html#a092224" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
