<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a115644"></a>It's becoming hard to find news sources to point to. They all pop up ads, including Wikipedia. Many have videos that start playing automatically. It's nice to find a news site that doesn't do this. So far Axios and TPM are both reliable. But they don't have all the stories I want to link to. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/23.html#a115644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a114644"></a>I like yesterday's blockbuster <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/8/22/16186928/kyrie-irving-trade-celtics-isaiah-thomas-cavaliers">trade</a> betw Boston and Cleveland. I think Cleveland got the better deal. Kyrie Irving is a solid superstar, but I don't think he drives other players to perform. Not like the guy they traded for, Isaiah Thomas. He's a force of nature. I guess the Celtics thought he would burn out fast and Kyrie will last a while and will like staying in Boston. Cleveland is destined to be volatile. But it'll be interesting to watch Thomas and LeBron team up. Two very different kinds of players.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/23.html#a114644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a103045"></a>Trump's speech last night was all about him, and not at all about the victims of the Charlottesville terrorism, a word btw he <i>still</i> refuses to use. Also Trump made no mention of the sailors who died on the USS McCain.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/23.html#a103045" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
