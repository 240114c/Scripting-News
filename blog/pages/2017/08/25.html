Tech companies get away with it because journalists worship the icons of tech. They can do no wrong. And they're cute, like baby squirrels. The tech gods know you think this about them and fully take advantage of it. Also journalists aren't confident in their understanding of technology. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/25.html#a093320" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a101749"></a>One of the feeds in Instant Dave, the <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.json">one</a> from Scripting News, is not processed through <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>, it's handled separately. RSS aggregators are complicated because they have to handle all the variability in feeds. Feeds that omit required elements, or do it creatively or in some cases, wrong. For this feed, I assumed it was correct in every way. I can assure that because I maintain the feed. I wanted to see how different things would be if there was less variability. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/25.html#a101749" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a105950"></a>Fixed a bug in the server behind <a href="http://instantdave.com/">Instant Dave</a>. If two items appeared on this blog at the same time, it would only push one to the ID client. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/25.html#a105950" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a110040"></a>BTW, I think <a href="http://instantdave.com/">Instant Dave</a> is a prototype for other Instants. I want each of the news sites that I'm most <s>addicted to</s> connected to to have one. I'd keep an app open on my desktop for Qz, TPM, Axios, Maddow, as examples, esp if they included links from other pubs, analogous to my <a href="http://scripting.com/links.html">linkblog</a>. There should be a competiton for a semi-exclusive connection to people I think of as news mongers. People who have a voracious appetite for new useful non-salacious info.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/25.html#a110040" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a113344"></a>Fixed another <a href="http://instantdave.com/">Instant Dave</a> bug where it would use the wrong value to update the <i>when</i> field of the message display. This would be most obvious on posts that were published out of sequence (which is only likely when another bug was hiding the old post). The date would transform from something like <i>Yesterday at 11:23 AM</i> to <i>32 mins. </i>A misunderstanding in the software. Like most bugs! In any case after today this bug would have remained hidden, possibly forever. Something like a solar eclipse. Glad to have found it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/25.html#a113344" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a114921"></a>He keeps getting into deeper and deeper shit, very deliberately, so a father figure can bail him out. He always has a father figure around.

Sometimes the father figure is actually a woman. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/25.html#a114921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a115109"></a>Trump is one of those peoples, and the really interesting thing is he plays the father-figure role, too, for <a href="https://georgelakoff.com/2016/03/02/why-trump/">voters</a>. He puts on a show. This is how a father talks to children he loves. You can hear it in his speech, not in the words, but in how he relates. If you ignore the words he's a pretty nice guy. The kind of dad who'd throw around a football with you on a Saturday. Maybe more like a fun uncle. But in real life, he's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Huey">Baby Huey</a>. Actually an evil Baby Huey. Not a good thing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/25.html#a115109" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
