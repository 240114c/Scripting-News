<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a120714"></a>I understand why people like Trump. When I was a teen and into my early 20s I used to love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imus_in_the_Morning">Imus in the Morning</a> on WNBC in NY. He was incredibly rude. That's what I liked about him. The creativity of his rudeness. I outgrew it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/29.html#a120714" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a101658"></a>I think of the <a href="https://api.nytimes.com/podcasts-rss/zKq6WZZLTlbM?apikey=18736e07a8184bf2a3f1a9ed57ed5152">Daily podcast</a> as the <i>NYT podcast. </i>It's really good enough to be thought of that way. And you can tell that the people he interviews, who are all <a href="http://nytimesriver.com/">NYT</a> reporters, feel that way too. It wasn't like that at first. I don't think they knew why they were doing it. Now I think the Daily must be catching on inside the <a href="https://twitter.com/nyt">NYT</a>. The reporters are all very different people. Yesterday's was especially illuminating. I love seeing a venerable old newspaper transition to another great new medium. To help define that medium. It continues to be a great podcast.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a101510"></a>Listening to the interview with Joe Arpaio yesterday on the <a href="http://podcatch.com/pages/18591.html">NYT podcast</a>, I realized very clearly why Trump likes him. They come from the same place, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens">as do I</a>. I went to school with kids who were like Trump, kids who had KKK/Nazi parents, who felt they were of superior stock. In fact, Trump sometimes reminds me of people in my own family. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/29.html#a101510" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

			<li><a name="a074241"></a>I couldn't remember why they needed to convince Cersei of anything.

			<li><a name="a073937"></a>I guess they wanted to get the big scene with Cersei and the Mother of Dragons in the same place so Cersei could spit and sneer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/29.html#a073937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

			<li><a name="a073938"></a>That said, the part with Arya and Sansa was just beautiful. I get goosebumps as I write this.

		<li><a name="a012508"></a>I just asked Lisa Williams to post one of her items on a blog, usually I don't, because it gets people upset. I was going to ask Enoch Choi also because I know he believes in the web, but he's busy, and the web stuff is probably very tangential to what he's doing right now.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/29.html#a012508" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040208"></a>Think of it as a Web Corps. Very simple, transplant stuff outside Facebook so it can be accessed everywhere.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/29.html#a040208" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a040209"></a>Update: Lisa posted her item on <a href="https://lisawilliams.github.io/lisa/tech/2017/08/28/Hurricane-Harvey-Senior-Tracker.html">her blog</a> (she was already working on it when I asked) and I transplanted Enoch's post <a href="http://this.how/transplants/enoch.opml">on this.how</a>. So we're up and running. There's no "official" place to transplant to, as long as it has a URL that's publicly accessible. ;-) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/29.html#a040209" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
