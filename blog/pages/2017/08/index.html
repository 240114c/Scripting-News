Set up newsrooms in places where the victims are and let them write the news. Make sure their story gets through <i>directly</i> to people outside Houston.

I don't care how someone got to the party, as long as you're here, I'm your fellow party-goer. (Too long to be a motto, I know.) The net culture really needs to absorb this one.

		<li><a name="a111441"></a>This a really nerdy post. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a111441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a111451"></a>ES6 is the newest version of JavaScript, and it's gradually making its way into online docs and browser runtimes everywhere. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a111451" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li data-flNumberedSubs="true" data-subs="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]"><a name="a111518"></a>I'm starting to use one of its features, and am reluctantly having to use others, and looking forward to one being more broadly deployed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a111518" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<ul class="ulLevel1 ulNumberedSubs">
			<li><a name="a111557"></a>The feature I am using is <i>let. </i>It should have been the way declarations worked everywhere. You should be able to very precisely determine the scope of a variable by its placement. The crazyass way <i>var</i> worked in JavaScript was one of its worst features. <i>let</i> fixes that. I can't see why you would ever not use let. Except of course if you're using <i>const.</i> Another feature, borrowed from Pascal (and #define in C) that's very useful. It's already caught a bug for me. When something really can't change you should use const.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a111557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a111729"></a>Even though names <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html">don't</a> matter, I think <i>let</i> should have been called <i>local. </i>It's not clear from the names why <i>let</i> is local and <i>var</i> is more global. What's really going on is you're declaring a local, so it should have been called that. Regardless I'm happy to have what I regard as a bug fix. (The bugs caused by the way var is specified combined with the way asynch works can be truly spectacular.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a111729" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a111825"></a>The arrow notation for callbacks was uncalled for (heh awkward wording). What's the savings? Not having to include the word <i>function? </i>Really. We had a standard way to document callbacks. Now we have two ways. That's going in the wrong direction. (And we have two more ways, see the next section.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a111825" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a111904"></a>I don't like the new async version of promises which was a flawed improvement on callbacks. I think I don't mind <i>callback hell</i> so much because I edit in an outliner. If I wrote in a flat editor I can imagine I'd be desperate for something to unwind the indentation. As an outliner user, it's kind of cool in a Stockholm Syndrome kind of way. The problem is that people are going to ship sample code using all the fanciest new contraptions, making things that you want to be easy more complex. It's like using CoffeeScript for sample code. Please, just stick to basic common JavaScript (an idea that might be worth exploring).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a111904" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a112118"></a>And the feature I'm anxiously awaiting are modules in the browser. I wish there were exactly Node packages. They seem to be <i>inspired</i> by them instead. In any case modules will improve my client coding enormously. They take me back to my UCSD Pascal days in the late 70s which had units, which were even nicer (if I recall correctly) than today's modules. Nonetheless the ability to create your own APIs as a routine matter is essential for good development. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a112118" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a113438"></a>So much of the evolution of JavaScript has been an attempt to humanize the wrong way it does async. All that bullshit should have been buried in the runtime. That would be orders of magnitude faster and less error-prone for the human beings writing the software, and I bet you can even do optimizations in the runtime that make it faster. JavaScript will never be as easy as other Algol-like languages, and none of the patches and weird constructs will fix that, they only succeed in making it even more complex. That said, you can pry the JavaScript from my dead cold hands. This is the language I'm using, and that's that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/30.html#a113438" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I used to have fantasies of living in places like these. To the person who lives in the town by themself or in the beautiful desert house far away from everything, show them a picture of an apartment building in NYC and point to one window and say "you could live here" and they'd get all excited about all the people they would see every day just by walking around.

None of the services I've tried give you any idea up front how the process will work. How will the person be notified? What are the requirements on their end? In one case the person had to have an account at the same bank I was using. That was not said before I sent the money. I once tried sending money via Facebook, figuring they would have worked to get the glitches out. Nope. It took days for the money to clear at the other end, which wasn't overseas, it was <i>California</i> for crying out loud. Sending a gift certificate through Amazon to a relative in the UK was also a bad experience. She had to spend the money at Amazon in the US, which meant shipping costs to the UK would have been huge. They didn't say this up front, or I would have used Amazon UK to give the gift. We've been using the web for commerce for 20 years.

The same flow as before, but now the posts from <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> can update. There's a list of previous posts arranged vertically. I started with the code in <a href="http://screen2.io/">screen2.io</a>. You can <i>Like</i> a post. And you can write your own posts. Only you and I will see them for now, other people will just see what they post and what I post. It's called Instant <i>Dave</i> after all. Hope you give it a try. If you have feedback, please post a comment <a href="http://instantdave.com/#1501260201000">here</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/24.html#a101335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Roger Stone, Trump's longtime friend, just took a <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/08/24/roger_stone_if_you_impeach_trump_get_ready_for_violence_our_side_is_heavily_armed_by_the_way.html">step</a> towards that future. We should take him seriously and put him in jail for a long time, long enough so that he understands that there are limits to what we will tolerate. Threatening politicians with assassination is something we should have never allowed Trump to <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/aug/09/context-donald-trumps-second-amendment-people-comm/">do</a>, no matter how violent and deplorable some of his followers are. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/24.html#a031956" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a113836"></a>On the Daily podcast <a href="http://podcatch.com/pages/18426.html">yesterday</a> they had an interview with Matt Rosenberg, the NYT reporter who has been stationed in Afghanistan for much of the last 10 years. What should the US do in Afghanistan. Turns out, if we aren't nation-building, we can probably do a deal with the Taliban right now. They suppress Al Qaeda and ISIS within Afghanistan, and we leave. They didn't quite say it this way, but it was inescapable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/24.html#a113836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It felt like a body part was missing. A bunch of people said I should wait till the new version comes out next month. There was a time when I might have waited, but mobile devices now are like mid-size cars. If Volvo comes out with a new model I'm not even going to read the press release. I don't care. I just use it as a watch and to tell me what the date and temp is, and that's all. I was kind of interested to find out my new watch has GPS. It tells me to breathe. OK. I can't figure out how to get it to tell me how many steps I've taken today. I'd find that useful. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/24.html#a010528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I did read <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16180150/medium-paywall-articles-claps-author-payments">one</a> of the trade websites, but they mostly talked about the new business model based on "claps."

		<li><a name="a112539"></a>I've always been critical of Medium, not the software, but what they were doing to the community of individual web writers, people who <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/07/31.html#a091728">blog</a>. At this point I'm not concerned about that. We're in the long tail of the demise of Medium. They'll try this, and something else, and then another thing, each with a smaller probability of making a difference, until they turn it off. At that point, if that happens (disclaimer: I'm often wrong), it will be a disaster. A lot of important stuff was published on Medium over the years. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/24.html#a112539" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a112825"></a>But imho Medium still has a bullet in the chamber. They can stop being a silo and become a foundation others can build on, not just a way for writers to make money. Invest in open sourcing all of it, commit to keeping the servers up indefinitely (possibly make a deal with a university) and then invest in the projects that develop out of it. I think it's a reasonable bet, and the best one available at this time to Medium shareholders. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/24.html#a112825" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I've been suggesting that broadly. It wouldn't be hard to associate a geography with a new technology, just try to encourage a few people leading in the tech to move there. Imagine if there were no NBA and there are a few Steph Curry's floating around out there unaffiliated.

I think Cleveland got the better deal. Kyrie Irving is a solid superstar, but I don't think he drives other players to perform. Not like the guy they traded for, Isaiah Thomas. He's a force of nature. I guess the Celtics thought he would burn out fast and Kyrie will last a while and will like staying in Boston. Cleveland is destined to be volatile.

For once I hope the good people of this country get out in front of the progression. At every step we've not been willing to consider how it could get worse, and do what's needed to head it off. Then it gets worse and we do it again. Right now we have a Nazi president (I don't credit him with being a "sympathizer" as some do). We still have a political system that's capable of dealing with him, but the people who have the power refuse to use it. People already have died. We have to be ready to deal with the thugs and their violence, either way. The question is can we handle having the American government leading them? One more Supreme Court appointment and we'll have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_carry_in_the_United_States">open carry</a> everywhere and you'll have to be a white male non-Jewish property owner to vote. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/19.html#a104323" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a085751"></a>Here's the story. At one time I had my own search engine because Google wasn't yet doing a great job of indexing blogs. There was a small search form on every page. The archive pages from the blog in this period, in 2006, eleven years ago, are still there. Here are <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/10.html">the</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/09.html">examples</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/07/18.html">they</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/11.html">cited</a>.

The answer is yes. The same way Al Qaeda and ISIS crave publicity for their atrocities, American terrorists use publicity to drive recruitment, to grow, so the next march and uprising is bigger. More campus invasions. A clash between the First and Second Amendments. Liberal college towns: Austin, Berkeley, Madison, Ann Arbor, Boulder, Cambridge, Portland, Raleigh. Every time POTUS does a press conference and whistles loudly saying he's behind the movement, expect more deplorables to step up. The people at the marches looked like people who last year at this time were going to Trump campaign rallies. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/15.html#a101615" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I agree, strongly. But then he struggles with what it means when Peter Thiel, a board member of Facebook supports Trump.

Now I'm too wise. I know that the picture a house paints has little to do with the lives that are led inside it. Sometimes the most beautiful surroundings are home to the most miserable people. And there can be much happiness and love in humble even ugly surroundings. The beauty of a house is a symbol for us, a symbol of beauty inside the people living there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/14.html#a094950" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a015252"></a>Node is a fine environment, I use it as my main server runtime, and lately I've been <a href="http://this.how/electricRiver/">building</a> a lot with <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, and there you're using Node on the desktop. I have a love-hate relationship with Node, I'm a prisoner to some bad design imho but it's great to have one syntax instead of two for client and server apps. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015252" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a015424"></a>But other environments like Java and Python are probably just as efficient as Node <i>without all the crazy callbacks. </i>Their runtimes can suspend a process until its I/O completes. All the other languages/environments do that. It is not something that only Node does. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/06.html#a015424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a015554"></a>The difference between Node and other environments is that the others hide the suspending and resuming of your app behind an abstraction layer, <i>and that's good, </i>that makes your code <i>much</i> simpler. In every way imho the way JavaScript does I/O is a major step backwards. But like I said I love/hate JS.

		<li><a name="a020140"></a>I use the <a href="https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser">feedparser</a> package in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>.

		<li><a name="a073716"></a>Back in 2013 when I was getting started on Node, it was a little tricky adapting to feedparser, because the package is designed for maximum efficiency at the expense of a bit of ease-of-use, especially for a Node newbie. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/04.html#a073716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a115316"></a>I was reading a bit about the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=why+css+sucks&t=hu&ia=web">history</a> of CSS, and kept thinking -- what a shame, they did it totally backwards. This is what I would have done. First I would have made a design tool that worked really well. Then I'd have it spit out XML (sorry JSON didn't exist at the time) and teach the browser to render that. All this would happen iteratively. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/04.html#a115316" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

			<li><a name="a114853"></a>Good performance in the browser and on the net (considerations: how long to render, how big the files are, latency, bandwidth, out over time).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/04.html#a114853" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a115423"></a>The third item is way way down the list. Yes it should be easy to do it by hand. But we shouldn't <i>always</i> be doing it by hand as it works now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/04.html#a115423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a114959"></a>What we ended up using was impossible to create a tool for, is utterly perplexing to everyone who has to use it, and is missing huge features that cripple everything we do. The <i>whole world</i> is now built around the crazy design system called CSS. Everywhere and everything.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/04.html#a114959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Had done a lot of prototyping. It was rules-based and you could see the impact of your rules immediately on the screen. Made iteration fast. Would have been perfect for responsive design. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/04.html#a115059" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120105"></a>It's one of those "if only" things -- if only we had been in position to do this, in a competitive way. That's one of the big tradeoffs of going the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities">standards</a> route. You often get really bad designs and have to live with their limits, for a generation or two. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/04.html#a120105" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

(Not.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082402"></a>So on Monday morning I decided it was time to move my Dropbox folder from the external drive to my unused 1TB internal drive. First there was a permissions problem. Fixed that. Then it took a good 24 hours to move the folder! All the while the computer was unusable. So I used my laptop and surprisingly got a lot of good work done. I should probably go on a trip. Anyway..<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082402" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082528"></a>Now everything's done, but Dropbox is downloading the whole folder again, for what reason exactly? As of last night it had over 600K files to download. This morning when I start work it's still got <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/08/02/dropboxSync.png">over 400K</a>. What the fuck Dropbox. What was the point of taking 24 hours to move the folder if you just have to re-download everything all over again?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a082643"></a>Anyway, one of the advantages of being a senior is that I will forget all this soon enough. And because I'm a senior, I'm laughing out loud while I write this. Cackling really. This is what happens when you get old. Your mind and body fall apart but your sense of humor gets really sharp! God is merciful. Also the programming project I'm working on is truly wonderful. Open source software makes all kinds of things possible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/02.html#a082643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Which raises again the basic question behind creative work on the Internet -- when are we going to start building structures designed for longevity. With an economic model other than founders-get-rich. We should be thinking about a creative environment that builds on its achievements, and creates a usable archive. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/08/01.html#a085611" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
