I was finally an adult, in love, lots of friends and accomplishments everywhere. Firing on all cylinders. One of the most prime periods of my life. I guess I'm going to listen to a lot of Steely Dan in the next few weeks. Kind of the way we listened to a lot of Prince last year.

For now, we're careening on the brink of nuclear, economic and environmental disaster. I'll let you know if that changes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/03.html#a015251" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Trump is cutting the money to let people know when the ObamaCare registration period begins (Nov 1) and ends (Dec 15). All we have to do is fill in for the missing ads. Get creative. <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/904039341219082240">Here's</a> the basic info. <i>Pass it on. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/03.html#a115846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
