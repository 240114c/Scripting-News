<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124530"></a>I stumbled across this <a href="http://static.scripting.com/photos/archive/2005/05/22/stormyAtlanticInCrescentBeachFl/original.jpg">gorgeous picture</a> I took 14 years ago at the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/crescent-beach-st-augustine">beach</a> in Florida. That's one of the reasons I have a blog. So I can leave a memory of this on the web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/04.html#a124530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a093030"></a>I really went to town on the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/s3BigUpload">s3BigUpload demo app</a>. Not sure why.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a093119"></a>I worry what will happen when and if NPM or GitHub add business models to the services they provide. I pay GitHub a monthly fee, to help be somewhat sure <a href="https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories">my repos</a> are not filled with ads or made to comply with some rule I don't support. It's so funny to see the press just begin to tune into the power tech companies have to interfere with our creative work. I've been ringing this bell for a very long time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/04.html#a093119" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I have this awful pain in both my feet in the heel that happens whenever I walk. That's right when I walk. I thought oh shit this is going to mean surgery for sure. I looked it up on the net. Turns out lots of people get this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/04.html#a124457" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a125006"></a>They recommend special shoes or orthotics, which means a trip to a bunch of special doctors which is something I totally hate, because they all get their money, and that means tests and all kinds of shit that you know is going to come out false.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/04.html#a125006" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a124951"></a>Anyway, I thought it might have something to do with the way I sat, so I tried to adjust the chair I sit in when I work, and realized as I bent down that I was getting this nice good feeling from the part of my heels that hurt. And the rest of the day, no pain! Turns out I needed to stretch the muscles.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/04.html#a124951" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
