Here's the concept. If you can get it running on your desktop, you can have any number of simple-to-write publishing systems running there too. It takes care of exactly what's needed for a person to publish without any opinion about the software you use to do the writing or rendering. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a123204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124817"></a>Dropbox was quite close to the idea of <i>Public Folder, </i>but once it became popular they pulled back from it. As I understand it, if you created your account after 2012, you didn't have a public folder. I did, because I was an early adopter. It was good, but had missing features, which I lamented here on this blog many-a-time. If only they had seen Dropbox as a publishing platform, but they didn't. They finally turned the feature off on Sept 1, four days ago.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a124817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124941"></a>Another precursor of <i>Public Folder</i> was upstreaming in Radio UserLand, released in 2002. PF should be a lot more efficient and powerful, but that said, upstreaming was pretty good, and Radio -- through upstreaming -- was one of the pillars of the early blogosphere, and an interesting web product as well. Radio had a CMS built in. This time around I have created that as a separate module. I'm pretty sure any static site generator that runs where Node runs will be compatible with Public Folder. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a124941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a011300"></a>One more thing. There's a <a href="http://publicfolder.io/">placeholder site</a> for the project, and there will also be a public GitHub repo, and more. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a011300" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Cancer. He wrote about it <a href="https://medium.com/season-of-the-witch">on the web</a>, of course. A natural-born blogger. Apparently Ted asked for a new <a href="https://twitter.com/jw/status/904941100644818945">laptop sticker</a>, and it's a good one. Looks like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clematis">clematis</a> flower with a simple message -- <i>Enjoy Every Day. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a104849" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a084541"></a>What we used to call tweetstorms are now call threads, and they're <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/05/twitter-thread-social-media-trend-215539">huge</a>. There is no better way to post a thread than <a href="http://pork.io/electric/">Electric Pork</a>, a Mac app that chops a blog-post-length tweet into a beautiful thread, written by yours truly, the author of this humble blog.  <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a084541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
