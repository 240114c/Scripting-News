<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a075906"></a>Instead of watching Hardball on MSNBC I watched the last hour of Frost/Nixon, time well spent. Great movie. And Trump totally rehabs Nixon.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/06.html#a075906" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a051201"></a>Working my way through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos_(season_3)">Narcos</a>, season 3. At first it didn't hold my interest, but four episodes in, I'm getting hooked. Also looking forward to the next season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman">Bojack Horseman</a>, on Netflix, on Friday. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/06.html#a051201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The most shocking realization when I did <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/03/01/juryduty.html">jury duty</a> was that I was the jury. I had spent so much time reading and watching courtroom dramas that it snuck up on me that the body of the trial was in my own body. After years of tweeting at and about presidents, I don't think <i>El Orange</i> has yet realized he's the guy in the hot seat. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/06.html#a105146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a094746"></a>For JavaScript nerds, the problem was this. Whenever a new item came in or was updated, I ran a bit of magic jQuery code that caused all links to open in an external window, outside the Electron context. If you let the app run for a while, one click would open five tabs (same link five times). Eventually one click would open 1000 tabs. The problem was fixed by adding a single line of code, to unregister the click handler before re-registering it, assuring that there's only one handler for each link. Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/b7234a0840112217c0945cd92acf8acd">new code</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/06.html#a094746" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Maybe <i>they</i> don't know that about themselves, it's possible they're not paying attention, but the net-effect is the same.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/06.html#a103542" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

She has emerged from Burning Man, so my work appears to be finished with the <a href="http://this.how/burnerNews/">Burner News</a> page. A bunch of stuff happened while the Burners were offline: Trump's transgender ban, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, Hurricane Harvey destroyed Houston, the fourth-largest American city, North Korea launched an ICBM-like missile over Japan, Mattis decided for now transgender troops will stay, a Utah nurse is arrested for preventing police from taking blood from an unconscious patient (an important story, more so since Jen is from Utah), Walter Becker of Steely Dan died, North Korea tested a hydrogen bomb, Trump rescinds DACA, Hurricane Irma is heading towards Miami, Hurricane Jose is right behind it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/06.html#a100056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
