<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a010132"></a>Yes, Twitter and Facebook are infested with fake people. Journalism can create new aggregations of news that aren't. Start with your bookmarks and <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>. Let's go!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a010132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a092706"></a>To <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/scott-pruitt-climate-change-insensitive-floridians">Scott Pruitt</a>, if you don't like to talk about climate change you should get another job. Your current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_the_Environmental_Protection_Agency">job</a> is all about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-08/how-science-links-climate-change-to-irma-s-wallop-quicktake-q-a">climate change</a>. 24-by-7, 52 weeks a year, rain or shine. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a092706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

You could say it's 1/2 of a meltdown of the economic system in the US. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a013831" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a013906"></a>I haven't heard anyone say exactly what information has escaped, let's assume it's the worst, it's all the info needed to identify a person. Maybe their credit history, although with this information you could access anyone's history. So why would you bother <a href="https://www.axios.com/what-to-do-next-after-equifaxs-security-breach-2483302344.html">locking</a> your account so lenders know not to give you any loans? Is anyone going to trust that info in the future? I can't see why they would. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a013906" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a014212"></a>I haven't seen anyone suggest you change your password this time. It's usually pointless advice, but this time it would be especially idiotic. You can't change your birthdate, social security number or mother's maiden name. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a014212" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a013938"></a>I say this is only 1/2 because the other half would be a meltdown of the money system. Suppose you went to the ATM to get some cash and found you didn't have an account. Or your brokerage account was cleaned out. Or you learn that your mortgage payments have been going to Russia and you no longer have a place to live. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a013938" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a014041"></a>When that happens, and I can't imagine it <i>won't, </i>it will be a civilization-level meltdown. If you think the US govt is doing anything to prevent it, well I'm not very confident about that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a014041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Now we can start learning and developing. It will be an interactive experience. I want to create a new kind of environment, to stimulate thinking and to get ideas for new features, shaping what I hope will become a new medium.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a091432" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091602"></a>Naturally people ask how can they get their own? And that's something I don't know how to answer, at least not yet. But the name suggests that in addition to <a href="http://instantdave.com/">Instant Dave</a> there will be other <i>Instants. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a091602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091657"></a>I'd say the first step is to blog, and then start a linkblog (like <a href="http://scripting.com/links.html">this</a>) and use a photo service like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> that has <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> support. The idea is to aggregate them all into one easy to follow stream. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a091657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091751"></a>What software to use? For blogging, obviously there are lots of choices and they all support <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> which of course is the basic technology behind the <i>Instant</i> movement. Your podcasts will have an <a href="http://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/why-rss-feeds-still-beat-facebook-and-twitter-for-track-1800722740">RSS</a> feed (or else they are not podcasts and shouldn't be calling themselves that). For linkblogging I recommend my own <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>. And to aggregate them all into one stream, try <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> or <a href="http://this.how/electricRiver">Electric River</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a091751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a092631"></a>And of course use <a href="http://instantdave.com/">Instant Dave</a>. If you're going to be an actor you want to soak up as much other people's acting as possible, so you can steal ideas from them. Blogging is no different. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/09.html#a092631" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
