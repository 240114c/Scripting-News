You hear this idea all over the place. The Russians couldn't have known to target Facebook users without help from Americans. This is a crazy idea. Russia is on the Internet. Data moves around the net very easily. Someone in Moscow could have just as much info about America as someone in Boston. Crazy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/12.html#a070501" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a053521"></a>Got a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/26">report</a> that clicking on tabs on mobile devices does not work. I am able to reproduce it here. I will look into that first thing tomorrow, with a fresh start. It's been a long (successful) day! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/12.html#a053521" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124054"></a>Update at 12:40PM Eastern: I replaced the old JS and CSS files with the new ones that support the tabbed home page. Here's an example of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/">month archive</a> page, and a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/08.html">day archive</a> page. They seem to work. I see a few CSS glitches. (The color of the wedges on the Twitter inclusions are wrong.) I still have to add the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/25#issuecomment-328613821">fix</a> for arrow keys and Page Up and Down. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/12.html#a124054" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a115132"></a>The corner is turned. There are <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/09/12/tabsOnHomePage.png">tabs on the home page</a>. Still loose ends to tie up. I have to edit the links in the sidebar and on the About tab. Re-integrate the new JS file with the one used prior to this turn. Same with CSS. But the heavy lifting appears to be done as of 11:52AM Eastern. Knock wood. Praise Murphy. I am not a lawyer. It's even worse than it appears. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üí•</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/12.html#a115132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I closed the window when he started talking about the new visitor center. I'm sorry, I don't care.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/12.html#a011250" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
