<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a053721"></a><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/vanguard-shines-in-protgs-1-million-bet-with-warren-buffett-2017-2">Warren Buffet bet</a> on an index fund over a managed fund, and he was right, he's winning the bet. I even understand why, as I've bet the same way more or less. Governments are judged by two prices: gas and stock. If gas is down and stock is up, the president wins re-election. So guess what. Gas stays low and stock goes up. It's like free money, basically. Until there's a war or a bubble burst. But most of the time you just make money with an index fund. Now you have the secret too. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üçé</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/19.html#a053721" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't think his brand was helped or hurt. I think it's all mixed up with Melissa McCarthy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWuc18xISwI">parody</a>. Spicer will forever be a punchline. Some things probably will never matter. This imho is one of them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/19.html#a022659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

			<li><a name="a103153"></a>Email is inherently insecure. You're spreading your ideas all over the place when you send an email. Just because the person-to-person channel is guarded, it doesn't prevent the email from being forwarded, saved to disk and transmitted other ways, or through phishing, being stolen as part of a whole mailbox. When you secure email transmission, you're locking a window but all the doors are wide open. It's really just security theater. In other words, someone is taking advantage of your ignorance, and there's one way to fix that -- to stop being ignorant. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/19.html#a103153" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a103158"></a>Trolls. We're being trolled. There's nothing new or novel about this. I know it's hard to not be fascinated, I could tell you stories of years I wasted dealing with trolls, thinking I could win by engaging. You can't. The only way to win is to just turn your back. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/19.html#a103158" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a102944"></a>Meanwhile Google is wiping out the history of the web, the few sites that remain from the early days, by doing it in a slow almost invisible way. I guess I have to give up on trying to stop this. I'm going to let them delete my sites over the coming years. I have done make-work for BigCo's in the past, countless times, thinking if I just do what the big company is forcing me to do, it'll all work out. Now I know that isn't true. It doesn't work that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/19.html#a102944" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
