I have a project ready for testing now, this podcast explains. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a015429" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a022657"></a>I've been steadily releasing new versions of the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/publicfolder">publicFolder package</a> over the last few days. Fixing bugs, adding stats and callbacks. The current version is v0.4.23.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a022657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="tweet" data-tweetId="910634410529222657" data-tweetUserName="davewiner"><a name="a063830"></a>I did finally listen to Trump's speech at the UN, in full. It was horrifying. It's like he pulled his pants down and took a shit on stage. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a063830" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a064223"></a>Also the <a href="http://podcatch.com/pages/19362.html">Daily podcast</a> about the Trump speech is worth listening to. They take it all in stride, which is somewhat disturbing. But it's useful. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a064223" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/910557380961857540"><a name="a013321"></a>This <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/910557380961857540">dialog</a> pops up when I click most Medium links. I hate this dialog with a passion. It's a paywall thing. Before the paywall goes up. The word that best describes the feeling is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bilious&t=h_&ia=definition">bilious</a>, which btw is a great word. ;-) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a013321" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a014117"></a>The thing about silos is they do things to your reader they don't do to you so you don't know they're doing it.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urltweet="https://twitter.com/bhgreeley/status/910499092677218309"><a name="a100444"></a>Brendan Greely: "I was a healthy person subsidizing sick people until both of my sons spent a week in the pediatric ICU together." This is the drum I keep beating. Health care is <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/03/08/theWorldIsSocialistPartIi.html">socialist</a>. When Repubs complain that we're socializing medicine, they're wrong. It's not up to us to socialize it. It is socialist.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a100444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a115812"></a>I'm the first to blame Facebook when they're at fault. But this is not their fault.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a110716"></a>I was chatting with a friend who reads this blog, and explained that sometimes when I'm critical of a big tech company, it's not just me speaking, sometimes I'm echoing ideas I've heard from people inside the company. People who aren't being listened to. I guess in that way I'm acting something like a reporter with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)">source</a> who is on background. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a110716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

On Twitter he <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/910508236423405569">asked</a> if he should point to the Medium versions of his post or the <a href="http://pressthink.org/">blog</a> version. I thought I'd answer on my <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a111938">blog</a>. It wouldn't make much difference to me. I read his blog through his feed, and I dislike going to Medium, because of the interstitial dialog that pops up before I can read a piece. So I guess it would annoy me to see a Medium link to Jay's posts, but I'd get over it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a111938" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a114759"></a>BTW, I tried an experiment, different from Jay's, cross-posting from my blog to both Facebook and Medium. I <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/04/endingAnExperiment.html">ended the experiment</a> about a year ago. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/20.html#a114759" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
