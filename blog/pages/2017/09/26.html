<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a022439"></a>I now have <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagepark">PagePark</a> serving public outlines edited with <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner</a> at the domain my.this.how. Here's what the canonical <a href="http://my.this.how/users/davewiner/myOutlines/states.opml">states outline</a> looks like when viewed in this mode. If you're clever you can figure out how to get your Little Outliner outlines to do the same thing, or wait for the howto, coming soon. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/26.html#a022439" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a093426"></a>Feature request for Twitter. Please, in addition to reporting followers and followed, also report muted. That is, report the number of people who have muted an account. I have muted the current president, and would like to have that officially counted. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/26.html#a093426" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a054431"></a>In 2010 I did a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/03/24/howBigIsANuggetofnews.html">study</a> to determine the ideal length for a nugget-of-news. Turns out it's approximately 185 chars.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/26.html#a054431" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a105205"></a>As he often does, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/why-cede-the-flag-to-trump/540930/">David Frum nails</a> the flag issue. He understands how the Repub pollster mind works. The flag is a good fight for Trump, he picked his foil, strong, young, virile, violent black men, telling his fans that the people they're rooting for in the NFL don't respect the flag or them. This is a must-read. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/26.html#a105205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urltweet="https://twitter.com/undisputed/status/912327330579677184"><a name="a105717"></a>Must-watch <a href="https://twitter.com/undisputed/status/912327330579677184">speech</a> by Shannon Sharpe. The protest eventually came <i>not</i> to be about black lives being snuffed out, rather the president challenged the owners and players to follow his order, and they don't accept being bullied. It was programming. In other words, he agrees with Frum. We have left the domain of Black Lives Matter, and are playing on the racists' turf now. Not a good place to be. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/26.html#a105717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
