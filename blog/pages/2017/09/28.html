<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a101408"></a>Here's an <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/f122c9356733ac7373e60ae865fef702">example</a> of the kind of code I routinely write as part of my development process. This script runs when I save <i>fargoPub, </i>one of my Node projects. It copies the public files to the place where my GitHub repo lives. It's not written in JavaScript, but I'd like to create a system where it could be.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/28.html#a101408" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Twitter can preserve the user experience, by only showing the first 140 characters (or 280 if they're committed to that), and adding a <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html">Show more</a> link as Facebook has been doing for years. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/28.html#a095723" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
