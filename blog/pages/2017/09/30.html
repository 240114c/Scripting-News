We are the #1 safe place to park wealth. But as we creep toward being Third World, we become less special. We can't base our political system on outright lies and still be the business, tech, science and education leaders. There will come a time when we are #2, and from there it's freefall.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/30.html#a122709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125148"></a>I grew up in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens">part</a> of NYC as Trump about 10 years later. Things hadn't changed much, for sure. There is a lot of racial prejudice among whites in Queens, esp re Puerto Ricans, which are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_migration_to_New_York_City">large minority</a> in NY. I was raised to believe many of the things Trump still believes. A lifetime of trying to keep my eyes and ears open and questioning assumptions has helped me undo some very wrong ideas. This is something Trump clearly has not done. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/30.html#a125148" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
