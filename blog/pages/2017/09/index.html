We are the #1 safe place to park wealth. But as we creep toward being Third World, we become less special. We can't base our political system on outright lies and still be the business, tech, science and education leaders.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125148"></a>I grew up in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens">part</a> of NYC as Trump about 10 years later. Things hadn't changed much, for sure. There is a lot of racial prejudice among whites in Queens, esp re Puerto Ricans, which are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_migration_to_New_York_City">large minority</a> in NY. I was raised to believe many of the things Trump still believes. A lifetime of trying to keep my eyes and ears open and questioning assumptions has helped me undo some very wrong ideas. This is something Trump clearly has not done. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/30.html#a125148" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The campaigns we create every four years should not disappear after the election. They should be built to have lasting value, to continue to serve the interests of the people who contribute, just as the Repubs continue to serve their donors. I'm thinking about the value I buy with my $2000, as if I were giving to a charity. How efficient are they at implementing my political values? I think we can and must do much better. In the podcast it takes a while for me to get going, but if you listen to the end I think you'll get what's driving me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/29.html#a121832" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

What would a visitor want to know. And then make sure the questions are answered on the home page of the site, near the top, in plain language. For example, if you're hosting an event, the basic info is -- 1. Where. 2. When. 3. How much. 4. What is it for. 5. Who should go. So often none of that information is anywhere in sight, even one click off the home page. Who designs these sites? They often look nice. I think people forget to do this because they already know all that, and they're thinking how to wow you and excite you. It's 2017, soon to be 2018. Websites aren't exciting anymore. Just the facts ma'am.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/29.html#a055437" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Often someone else's message is a perfect place to make a note. Like in this case -- Why is it heartbreaking? I'm guessing for this reason -- because it's something you're going to miss when life is over. Or something you'd like to share with someone who's no longer here. Or something you <i>did</i> share with someone who's no longer here.

Some people say the limit defines Twitter, and without it, Twitter would lose its identity, and something terrible will happen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a085023" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a085132"></a>I'm. So. Tired. Of. This. It's like that West Wing episode where the president says "Let's just dangle our feet in the water." They talk about doing all kinds of things, but don't do them. At the end, Leo writes something on a notepad that has been used by real presidents at least a couple of times since -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9-3NxTzQ8">Let Bartlet Be Bartlet</a>. Well, it's time to Let Twitter be Twitter, and no, I don't think it has anything to do with the 140-char limit. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a085132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a085434"></a>I think the 140-char limit is something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_memory#640_KB_barrier">640K limit on PCs</a>. At first it seemed enough, but then a few years later, memory was full of spreadsheets and word processing documents and TSRs, and all kinds of crazy fixes appeared for extending the memory, and in doing so made the whole thing much more unusable. Along came the Mac with its mouse and graphic user interface, but as a developer, I think the fact that the Mac didn't have the 640K limit was an equally important factor. There were no limits to the Mac's growth for software developers. In this analogy, on Twitter, writers are the developers. And any writer who thinks every idea can be expressed in 140 chars, has imho never seriously used Twitter. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a085434" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a085659"></a>If we're going to <i>Let Twitter Be Twitter, </i>maybe there are other things that are more important than the 140-char limit? I think of Twitter as the <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/912863256963817472">place</a> where newsmakers make news. Where the people who write the news work, and where people who want news gather. It's all focused on news. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a085659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091335"></a>In 2010, I did a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/03/24/howBigIsANuggetofnews.html">study</a> to see, from NYT feeds, how long the average synopsis is. It was more than 140. And 280 characters would have been enough for all but the longest. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a091335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a085808"></a>Also, just sayin, it isn't really working for Twitter-the-company. I bought a bunch of Twitter stock a couple of years ago, so I could have whatever upside was available, and so I could understand Twitter from the perspective of an investor. When the Knicks were faring as poorly as Twitter is as a stock, they basically got rid of everyone and started over. Sad as I was to say goodbye to JR Smith and Iman Schumpert and everyone else, I had to agree, this isn't working, and it's lunacy to keep betting on a team that's delivering such poor results. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a085808" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090000"></a>So if you think the 140-char limit is so great, why isn't Twitter making money for its shareholders? If you were management at Twitter would you be conservative or would you take risks? As a shareholder, I want them to take risks. Big ones. Why not? They don't really have anything to lose. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a090000" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a085315"></a>It could be that when you remove the 140-char limit, Twitter will just crumble into a mass of servers and Russian bots, and all the good people will go to Ello and Mastodon, or whatever -- maybe Facebook. After all, now that the 140-char limit is gone, why not just go ahead and post unlimited-length messages on Facebook? It could happen that way, but I don't think so.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a085315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090058"></a>I wish Jack and team would stop dangling their feet in the water and just make the change. I don't think the complaints are real. The people complaining don't <i>know</i> that easing the limit will screw up Twitter. They say they know, but they don't. If they don't like it they can always unfollow or mute people who use too many characters. But they won't. Users always complain about change. Sometimes they're right, but usually it doesn't make as much of a difference as they think.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a090058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a090255"></a>Also, why not make the limit 1000 characters or even 1,000,000? I can attach a video to a tweet that uses more than 1MB. Why not text? I don't see what they have against text. I did a <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html">design</a> for them a couple of years ago that shows how it could be done with zero disruption for 140-char lovers. It's not an original idea, I stole it from Facebook. This is an <i>easy</i> software design problem. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a090255" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091359"></a>We do this every time Jack Dorsey flirts with the idea. This time just do it and stop dangling your feet in the water. Let Twitter be Twitter. And next month let's break another rule and learn from it, and start growing this platform again. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/27.html#a091359" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a095408"></a>People are surprised that Russia was able to use <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/28/dontFeedDjTrump.html">trolling</a> to change the outcome of our election, but I wasn't. I had experienced at the hands of some Russian-like tech companies in the early 2000s. I was reminded of it by a <a href="https://ma.tt/2006/04/feed-validator/">screed</a> posted by Matt Mullenweg in 2006. Excellent stuff.

		<li><a name="a095439"></a>Matt's post came near the end of a long story involving open technology and some very big tech companies. The <a href="https://www.feedvalidator.org/">Feed Validator</a> app was written by people who worked at IBM and Google, the equivalent of Russia in this story. They ruled by flame. If you said something they didn't like, boom -- a swarm of trolls emerged to push you back. I assume they wanted <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> to fragment, the same way the Russians today want Americans to be divided. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/25.html#a095439" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a091622"></a>She replied: "I've blocked him at least 11 times. I'm done. He's totally recognizable, he uses the same screen name, just adds a number! He's ugly and abusive, and why can't they figure it out?

		<li><a name="a092604"></a>So the problem is and isn't solvable. If Twitter had the personnel to do it, they could recognize the pattern and shut him down when he pops up. Or at least be more responsive to claims of abuse. But they don't have the people, or the money to hire them. Twitter is bleeding cash. They <i>can't</i> throw money at it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/25.html#a092604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a091941"></a>More and more I'm realizing that Twitter and Facebook are just new instances of something we're really familiar with -- mail lists and discussion groups, without the human qualities. We found the answer, many years ago -- blogs. There's a physics to online discourse. Twitter/Facebook solve some of the problems of discussion groups, with blocking and following, but underneath it all it's still the same problem, everyone's voice is equal, so one troll can shut the whole thing down.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/25.html#a091941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I don't get angry with her for posting regurgitated MSNBC talking points, because she is a source of them.

		<li><a name="a035953"></a>The Knicks like it because they get to start over and they didn't have to give up a first round draft pick (rebuilding teams have valuable draft picks) and they got the Thunder to take the remaining two years on Melo's contract, and free up a huge amount of cap space for the Knicks, who can now invest it in younger players more suited for their young team.

But that doesn't tell the whole story. I was a healthy person subsidizing sick people until I needed life-saving heart surgery 15 years ago. Because of a sequence of COBRA, RomneyCare and ObamaCare, I have been insured ever since. Each year because of my age, I pay huge premiums. At times as much as $1500 a month with high dedictibles. In the interim, each year I used a fraction of that amount of health care. In other words as a person with a pre-existing condition (the definition of not healthy) I have been subsidizing sick people who need more health care than I do, and am happy to do it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/21.html#a102342" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They play the same ugly game with voter suppression (they <a href="http://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/heritage-explains/voter-fraud">call</a> it something else). And unmasking. I guess they must have been masked for a reason, you say. To protect someone. And to unmask them, well that's obviously bad, right? Haha. You fell for it. Even when you argue against it, saying it's harmless, you're falling for it. Maybe the best thing is to play along? Why were they masked in the first place? What were they hiding? Maybe you have to play the game to defuse it. Bottom line -- Repubs are scum. If you're a Repub and don't feel you're scum, maybe it's time to start something new. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/21.html#a094850" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

The purpose of therapy is to help you discover yourself. I know that sounds dorky and new-age-y, but it is literally what you're doing. You're bouncing around the world, looking for answers everywhere but the only place that can provide them, inside yourself. But if you don't know you exist, how can you find that place? A therapist patiently shines the light on that space, over and over, hoping that this year, or maybe next, you'll figure it out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/21.html#a092903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

One way to write a function, for example. No conditional assignment (even though I use it, and think it's clearer in some cases). Languages that get too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat">big</a> become dinosaurs more quickly.

Like this. "Are journalists more likely to view Amazon in positive light now that Bezos owns the Post? Perhaps even subconsciously?" Yes, of course. Because journalists love to get paid. (As we all do.) It's the ultimate form of recognition. Now Bezos is not only in a position to reward journalists, he is able to endow a journalist with enough money so you can do things that have nothing to do with making money. He can put you on the Woodward-Bernstein platform.  Bezos is A-number-one-journalism-sugardaddy right now. The previous #1 was Pierre Omidyar, but now not so much because his once-promising journalism venture didn't turn out to be all that great. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/11.html#a104614" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If the ocean surges 1 mile inland, and you were on the beach before the surge, now you're 1 mile out to sea. In normal times you'd be pretty fucked if someone dropped you in the ocean a mile from shore. But you're in a hurricane. Huge waves. There's no one to rescue you. And (this is the part that will kill you) there are deadly objects in the water like buildings and trees and power lines, even a rope can entangle you and make it impossible for you to swim. And if you can't swim and you're a mile from shore, that's the end of you.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/10.html#a114000" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So when you hear the Dems should nominate someone like <a href="https://twitter.com/hackteck/status/906887538215997442">George Clooney</a> or even Al Franken, remember next time around we'll more likely want a bureaucrat, someone like Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.

It would be easy to launch a competitor to those companies, why is it any more complicated to run against an incompetent president? You just have to say it clearly. That seems to be the hard part, which is weird because that's what politicians are supposed to be good at. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/10.html#a112546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a094746"></a>For JavaScript nerds, the problem was this. Whenever a new item came in or was updated, I ran a bit of magic jQuery code that caused all links to open in an external window, outside the Electron context. If you let the app run for a while, one click would open five tabs (same link five times). Eventually one click would open 1000 tabs. The problem was fixed by adding a single line of code, to unregister the click handler before re-registering it, assuring that there's only one handler for each link.

Here's the concept. If you can get it running on your desktop, you can have any number of simple-to-write publishing systems running there too. It takes care of exactly what's needed for a person to publish without any opinion about the software you use to do the writing or rendering. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a123204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124817"></a>Dropbox was quite close to the idea of <i>Public Folder, </i>but once it became popular they pulled back from it.

It was good, but had missing features, which I lamented here on this blog many-a-time. If only they had seen Dropbox as a publishing platform, but they didn't. They finally turned the feature off on Sept 1, four days ago.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a124817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124941"></a>Another precursor of <i>Public Folder</i> was upstreaming in Radio UserLand, released in 2002. PF should be a lot more efficient and powerful, but that said, upstreaming was pretty good, and Radio -- through upstreaming -- was one of the pillars of the early blogosphere, and an interesting web product as well. Radio had a CMS built in. This time around I have created that as a separate module. I'm pretty sure any static site generator that runs where Node runs will be compatible with Public Folder. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/09/05.html#a124941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
