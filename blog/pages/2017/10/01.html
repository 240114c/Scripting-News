<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a022517"></a>I changed my name to <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/10/01/140chardave.png">140-char Dave</a> on Twitter, not as an endorsement of the 140-char limit, the exact opposite. It's a disclaimer. You're not getting full-strength Dave, you're getting a highly abbreviated version. I favor no limit, with a simple "show more" <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html">link</a> on tweets over 140. I understand some people don't favor such a change, but imho they are wrong. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a022517" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The result -- a lot of archive sites are offline. I'm going to work gradually over time to bring them back, using more reliable software. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a014008" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a014101"></a>They are the sites I created in the period 2008 through 2013, using the worldoutline software. I had the idea that domains and documents should be one and the same. Turns out there weren't so many advantages to that as I thought, and Google and EFF et al with their push to HTTPS made that an expensive decision. None of these sites can make that transition. There are too many -- a thousand of them, or so it seems. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a014101" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a014236"></a>Side-note, this is why platform vendors with their seemingly arbitrary "deprecations" are so poisonous to longterm creativity of developers. I'm sure it never occurred to Google or Mozilla that someone had tried to innovate this way. They can't keep up with everything, and aren't inclined to. That's the way big companies are. That's why the web was so enticing. No platform vendor to fuck with you. Well, Google wants to be the platform vendor for the web, and now we're dealing with the usual malaise that platform vendors bring. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a014236" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a014418"></a>Anyway, you'll see me pointing to various sites today and hopefully in the future as they get resurrected in the new way of things. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a014418" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

He says that the press used to be gatekeepers, but not so much these days. I still get my news from the major brands, only a few new ones have entered my zone of trust. And they are total gatekeepers. My number one frustration is the inability to join the discourse. I feel my ideas are good enough to be part of the flow, esp when there's so much boring repetition. For whatever reason it's impossible. And that's very frustrating. I don't know what the answer is but I think about it all the time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a114016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a114620"></a>In that context I find the new voice of <a href="https://twitter.com/CarmenYulinCruz">Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz</a> to be inspiring and optimistic. She was unknown just a few days ago, and has said things that normally would never get through the gatekeepers. But she had what it takes. A big enough title to make her not such a risk, and an eloquence and directness that serves as a wonderful foil to the panic, cowardice and covering-up of El PresidentÃ¨. Her anger comes through, and it seems real, which is very unusual for TV news.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a114620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a113631"></a>What if everyone kept a public list of things everyone should know that they probably don't know, and why they should know it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a113631" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a113835"></a>Here's one of the things I'd put in my list. Most supposed online jokes are not funny because this is not your living room and the people who hear it don't know you. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/01.html#a113835" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
