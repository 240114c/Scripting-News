<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a110121"></a>Follow-up on yesterday's <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/34">braintrust query</a>. Per Scott Hanson's recommendation, I installed MAMP. It's running and I've got a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/34#issuecomment-334476526">Hello World</a> app working. Also looking for a REPL, some way to issue SQL commands in the Terminal app. That must be possible, right??<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/05.html#a110121" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They show me ads for real estate in gorgeous places. Some of it way <a href="http:///scripting.com/images/2017/10/05/expensiveHome.png">too much</a> house (I try to signal to them to stop showing me that stuff). My sweet spot is betw $400K and $600K, in the Berkshires or Santa Fe, NM. I'm scared if they had a one-cick-to-buy button on some of the places I might actually click! The Berkshires esp must be a depressed real estate market, because the houses are amazing, and the pricing history indicates lots of markdowns in the last year.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/05.html#a101351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a101616"></a>My friend Cat Mikkelsen recently moved to Hawaii with her high-school-age son. I know her through her husband, a famous Mac developer from the 80s. She posts pics as she explores their new lifestyle in paradise. Yesterday she went kayaking on the ocean. That's a very effective way to sell real estate, indirectly, because seeing where she's going and what she's doing makes me want to buy something and live that lifestyle myself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/05.html#a101616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
