<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a091314"></a>I find that people mistakenly assume you're a newbie at everything if you're a newbie at something. They talk to you like you're a child, often forgetting they know you know a lot of shit about a lot of shit. BTW, this is not about you. It's a general comment. I learned a long time ago when you make a general comment on a blog people assume you're writing about them. I do it too. Seriously this is not about you. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸŽˆ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/07.html#a091314" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
