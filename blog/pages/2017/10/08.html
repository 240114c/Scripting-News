So much shouting and interrupting, slogans and distractions. The gun advocates have it down, they can stop anything from being seriously discussed. On CBS they did a better job, with two advocates, Diane Feinstein and Wayne LaPierre, who were not on a panel and thus no one could interrupt. A much more useful format. On an issue like this, where many of us feel the wounds (I walk on streets with lots of windows every day), it hurt me physically to hear people treat the subject so casually. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/08.html#a113554" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a114029"></a>Still no one has an answer why it should be possible for one person to shoot 600 people before being stopped.

				<li><a name="a011903"></a>What was the offense? It's so silly.

			<li><a name="a064544"></a>BTW, it looks like she removed the picture. It was a picture of NJ on the stairway at my old house in Berkeley, naked of course, but with her legs crossed, and arms spread out in the usual NJ way. They have to have their standards, I understand, and nipples are a no-no, this picture crossed the line, but..<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/08.html#a064544" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

			<li><a name="a012340"></a>I don't blame Facebook for this. They tried best they could to keep porn off their site. In my country nipples are considered pornographic. Their software hadn't learned yet to distinguish between photos scraped by their bot, vs photos posted by users. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/08.html#a012340" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a011925"></a>The moral of the story. When you want Facebook to stop political ads aimed at Americans from Russia, that means we're all going to be subjected to this kind of interrogation, not just about nipples, but also about our political values. People who believe you can cut out Russians without interfering with normal speech are naive about how the technology works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/08.html#a011925" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
