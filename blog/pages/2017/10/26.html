<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a120850"></a>Some <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/montreal/escalator-accidents-happen-every-2nd-day-in-montreal-metro-1.4369535">escalators</a> are so tall they scare me. Examples: 1. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_Street%E2%80%93Hudson_Yards_(IRT_Flushing_Line)">34th St</a> station on the 7 line. 2. The escalator connecting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutphin_Boulevard%E2%80%93Archer_Avenue%E2%80%93JFK_Airport_(Archer_Avenue_Lines)">E train</a> to AirTrain in Jamaica.

I should have seen this coming. The answer is no. Sorry, actually it's yes, I <i>could</i> do it, but no, I won't. Let me put it another way. Would you want to have all your Christmas presents opened at the same time? Would you like to be able to eat all 12 candies in a box at the same time, or would it be better to savor each one for its taste, texture, presence, the thought that went into its placement in the box? These are little gifts. You don't have to open them to get the value. But I do it this way to have a little fun with the presentation. So sorry, this is the way it is. However, I like to get feature requests and bug reports. If you have one please use the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues">issues section</a> on the repo for this site. Thanks! :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/26.html#a115615" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

This time it's worse because there are multiple often contradictory dogma that one must be sufficiently pious about and fear being accused of. It's worse for Republicans.
