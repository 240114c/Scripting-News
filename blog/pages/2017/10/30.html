I recorded this <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/30/aPodcastForMarco.m4a">10-minute podcast</a> to explain what I had in mind, generally, not about specific products (it was a long time ago, the opportunity long-since passed). Most of the time when you knock on the door saying <i>here's a free idea,</i> people think you want something. But sometimes it goes somewhere and that's when really interesting stuff happens. This is worth talking about. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/30.html#a040128" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a034810"></a>I was up late watching the fantastic World Series game betw the Astros and universally hated Dodgers. Today I've been beating a new app into submission, with good results. Also the Knicks were great last night. We have some really tall players and as a result the defense is kind of working. It's a surprisingly good team, and fun to watch. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/30.html#a034810" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Laundered money.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/30.html#a034742" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
