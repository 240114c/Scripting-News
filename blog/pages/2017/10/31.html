Was it a smokescreen, or is he really that bad. Imho yes he is really that bad. Two theories: 1. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's Razor</a>: Never attribute  to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence and 2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's Razor</a>:  If you had to guess who Trump would choose as Chief of Staff, would it be a babysitter or a fellow white supremacist? There was a lot of wishful thinking behind the idea that Kelly was effective "adult supervision." Now we're finding out what we should have assumed all along. He's just as much of a Nazi as Trump is.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/31.html#a124019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a094822"></a>I did something similar with podcasts, a couple of years ago, and the resulting website, <a href="http://podcatch.com/">Podcatch.com</a>, has been supplying me with great listening ever since. I have a hunch something similar could be done with TV series. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/31.html#a094822" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a095551"></a>The Simpsons, Jimmy Kimmel and Monday Night Football are not bingeable. Reality shows might be. I have to think about, I probably will err on the side of not including them. You can jump in at any point and watch a Simpsons episode.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/31.html#a095551" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a120820"></a>Implicit in "bingeability" is that a program be addictive, it hooks you, it tell a story. Fargo is bingeable. The Sopranos and The Wire, classic binges.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/31.html#a120820" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
