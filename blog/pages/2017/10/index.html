Was it a smokescreen, or is he really that bad. Imho yes he is really that bad. Two theories: 1. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's Razor</a>: Never attribute  to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence and 2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's Razor</a>:  If you had to guess who Trump would choose as Chief of Staff, would it be a babysitter or a fellow white supremacist? There was a lot of wishful thinking behind the idea that Kelly was effective "adult supervision." Now we're finding out what we should have assumed all along. He's just as much of a Nazi as Trump is.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/31.html#a124019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The panelists swirled all around what I feel is the obvious new direction for news. They must take responsibility for it, must define it. Letting tech define it results in Twitter and Facebook, neither of which are good at news. Twitter is sources. Facebook is friends. Both carry news, because there's a void, but not well. We should be much further ahead. News must create a new place for people who care to get vetted news. And become more inclusive of voices and ideas from outside their circle of comfort. Create an inclusive space that doesn't have deliberately misleading stories. This means also that news orgs are going to have to get the headlines in agreement with their stories. No more excuses about clickbait. News has waited for tech to lead them. That's the big mistake.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/28.html#a111311" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

A couple of observations, one lighthearted, and one dead serious. 1. As a Mets fan, I see a win in the Yankees loss in the previous round, esp if followed by a <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/11/baseballGotUglyLastNight.html">Dodgers</a> loss in the World Series. Almost as good as the Mets winning it all. Go Astros! 2. As an American who believes in the Constitution, I strongly believe God Bless America has no place in this game. Insisting that everyone stand and take off their hat while a soldier prays to your god, that's enough to get me to boycott baseball. It was wrong to start playing GBA after 9/11, but somewhat understandable. That was 16 years ago, come on MLB, open your doors to everyone, even people who think that religion, war and baseball don't have anything to do with each other.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/28.html#a100824" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a100428"></a>One of the nice things about Facebook that I will miss, if it ever goes away, is a simple act of Liking a post from someone I'm thinking of fondly, who I haven't seen in a while, and want to just say hey -- I'm thinking of you. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/28.html#a100428" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I stopped wearing it a few months ago, but it's going back on my sweaters and jackets as fall is here. It's really a good idea. It says I am the kind of American who believes in respecting everyone regardless of the usual things that divide us: race, religion, gender, age -- basically appearance. I'm giving everyone a chance to be the good human that they are in their core. I felt the need originally, about a year ago, just after the election, when walking around in shell-shocked NYC, I felt people's eyes on me, and my eyes on them, wondering if they had voted for Trump, or them wondering if I had. Now, a year later it's a different question. I don't care if you voted for Trump. I want to know if you think there were <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/white-house-watch-trump-and-the-very-fine-people-who-march-with-neo-nazis/article/2009314">very fine Nazis</a> marching in Charlottesville. I want to know that you won't be breaking windows on the American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>, should it ever come, or lynching a black man, or tormenting women who work with you. These issues are all related, rooted in the same cause, and I want to root that out and destroy it, or at least make it go back into hiding. Wearing a symbol on my jacket says all this. I hope.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/28.html#a095117" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a112546"></a>I've been trying to figure out how to put this idea in words. The world is teetering on the edge of nuclear war. The American president is provoking it. Meanwhile, most people are trying to get ahead as if everything was normal. Nazis marched in the street this summer, killed an innocent protestor, yet were defended by the same president. Very fine people, he <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22very+fine+people%22&t=hg&ia=news">said</a>. Companies are ripping off customers, shutting down the EPA, and journalism is thinking about page views, and congress people are thinking about reelection.

One of the presenters was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Stelter">Brian Stelter</a> of CNN.

You'd write a script in a BASIC-like language that got a pointer to the structure representing cnn.com, looked at the list of articles. If any had Stelter as the author, send him an email. It says something when users think of simple features, but the system isn't flexible enough so that the answer is almost as easy as stating the question.

I should have seen this coming. The answer is no. Sorry, actually it's yes, I <i>could</i> do it, but no, I won't. Let me put it another way. Would you want to have all your Christmas presents opened at the same time? Would you like to be able to eat all 12 candies in a box at the same time, or would it be better to savor each one for its taste, texture, presence, the thought that went into its placement in the box? These are little gifts. You don't have to open them to get the value. But I do it this way to have a little fun with the presentation. So sorry, this is the way it is.

I'm not a lawyer, but I know we can question generals, and that whether or not you have a Gold Star family in your circle of friends has no bearing on your ability to ask questions of the government. It could be that it just hasn't sunk in yet with Mr Kelly that <i>he is the government</i> now, and that gives him special responsibilities. It would be one thing if he were a retired general spouting off in his <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=dotage&t=hf&ia=definition">dotage</a>, but that's not who Kelly is. He's the Chief of Staff in the White House and his view of the world is much like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk">general</a> played by Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men.

How foolish, he hasn't passed any laws. But there's an argument to be made that it's true. Read about the dismantling of the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/war-on-the-epa/">EPA</a> and the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/state-department-trump/517965/">State</a> <a href="https://play.radiopublic.com/the-daily-GMB3yp/ep/s1!e08eb916944f82c8a28e7a3ca802df894b1a736b">Department</a>, and realize how long it will take to bring them back. Some people feel it's for the best that the US not have any controls on pollution or have any foreign presence. For them these are accomplishments. Trump may not know or care about what they're doing, that doesn't mean it's not part of a plan, that the Kochs and Mercers aren't intelligently looting the government. Things are happening faster than people may realize.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/20.html#a033350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

At the same level as Breaking Bad, only more bizarre. The acting was great. I thought the story from Stephen King they had to work with was so-so, that's why I expected the TV series to drift and get sappy, because that's what happened (imho) in the novel. But it didn't happen and I think I know why. The writer of the teleplay was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Lehane">Dennis Lehane</a> who himself is a fine novelist, author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_River_(novel)">Mystic River</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island">Shutter Island</a>, two great movies. He also wrote for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Lehane#Film_career">The Wire</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/20.html#a010326" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a011156"></a>In Mr Mercedes Lehane developed King's story into a 10-hour movie that would have been fine without the gore and violence, but it made it better, because it was delivered with humor and was outrageous and thrilling, on the same level as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film)">The Shining</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_(1976_film)">Carrie</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/20.html#a011156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a011621"></a>Even the computer stuff mostly made sense (in the novel it didn't, King doesn't really understand computers imho). There was even some good Mac humor in the story! How about that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/20.html#a011621" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a011247"></a>Lehane found the thread in the King novel that worked, he changed a couple of things, and let the plot develop at a good pace, and the characters were fun, entertaining, cute, motivated, lovely and brave, and most important, believable. I loved it.

			<li><a name="a121102"></a>First, people focus on the connection between RSS and podcasting, but it's deep technology, most people, users and creators, aren't aware of the connection. That part of the bootstrap, writing the spec, implementing an authoring tool and adding the feature to my RSS reader,  took a couple of days at most. The hard part was figuring out how to get people to do it! It wasn't a matter of "build it and they will come." It was a totally different story, like <a href="http://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_tom.html">Tom Sawyer</a> and the whitewashed fence. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/20.html#a121102" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a121307"></a>Second, RSS was already well on its way when we started up podasting, and would have thrived even if it had not come about. In hindsight the killer app for RSS was the New York Times. Once we had them on board, in April 2002, with daily updates to their feeds, it built out to a news network that to this day is delivering far better results for news consumers than anything else, even Twitter or Facebook. True, most people don't get their news directly from RSS feeds. But the people who really care about news do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/20.html#a121307" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			</ul>
		<li><a name="a121433"></a>RSS didn't need a killer app, it already had one. And RSS as a basis for podcasting, was essential to the bootstrap, but it was not the hard part. For that, we needed a bit of yeast to get the bread to rise. That came, as far as I'm concerned, from Chris Lydon, myself and then Adam Curry. At that point, we had enough examples for people to get the idea that they could do it too.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/20.html#a121433" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a121652"></a>Jason's well-intentioned understanding of how podcasting came to be, and what role RSS plays in today's news ecosystem is the one many people have, but it is wrong. Every time I see it I try to correct it. It's important because people who want to follow in the footsteps of RSS and podcasting, and develop open technologies, should know that there's more to it than technology. Without compelling content, that gets other people to do it, you don't even have a good demo. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/20.html#a121652" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

It presented a list of choices along with how much time they'd add to my trip. A button next to each one offered to add it as a stop. Smooth as silk. Another bonus, Google Maps says "Welcome to New Mexico" a mile or so before you see the official sign. It was a surprise and made me laugh.

He of course talked about the famous interview with the coal miner, but left out the best part, the thing he got dinged for the most (at least of what I heard) -- not challenging the guy on his opinion that coal didn't cause climate change. I totally supported that. I wanted to hear the guy's story and have the interviewer just let him say his piece. We know the arguments. It wouldn't have added anything to the story. Also, he defines the Daily as a podcast about the reporters who report the news. And the Longform interview was a podcsat about the podcast about the reporters who report the news.

		<li><a name="a023429"></a>In 2003, almost by accident, the company that I founded but had left, surprised me by directing requests to a popular domain to one of my colocated servers. I tried to keep it running but there was too much traffic. I couldn't do the work required to stabilize the service, i had a new job and my health was still iffy after heart surgery, and I would have had to buy a bunch more servers, and there was no revenue to support it. So I had to turn the service off. Really the only choice was to risk my health, and spend a lot of money. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/13.html#a023429" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Many of them had empty sites on the service, they had never published anything, so they didn't have anything at stake. I completely disclosed what happened. None of the bloggers referred to my post or the podcast I did explaining. They kept right on attacking. I appealed to blogging friends but they wouldn't say anything in my defense. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/13.html#a023543" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

We are a remarkably open society. They could read academic journals, or watch conferences on livestreams, or even go to the conferences. They could read Nate Silver and Jon Chait and many others, the same columnists that Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes read. Russia must have people who do what our CIA does. Read everything they can get their hands on and look for all kinds of changes and vulnerabilities. How do they think espionage works? You think they need help from Cambridge Analytica? Maybe there is a linkup there, I hope so -- but you're insulting our intelligence if you think the Russians can't carefully study us, the way we certainly study them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/12.html#a125111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLigBYhdUDs"><a name="a123657"></a>Carl Sagan used to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLigBYhdUDs">say</a> that humanity is the cosmos becoming self-aware, coming to "know itself." I always thought that was a super elegant idea. Well, Bob Corker saying the White House is adult day care is, in a similar way, the United States deciding to know itself, to tell itself the truth. Now reporters can quote him, saying what they could easily have said before, and imho should have. News has become news for lawyers. They're all trying to prove what's obvious, that we're reeling and teetering and sputtering on the edge of a cliff, with a guy juggling nukes in both hands and while they're in the air tweeting insults at everyone and anyone. It's as if Don Rickles and Joan Rivers were running the world, and they weren't just comedians. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/10.html#a123657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We talked about many of the things you'd expect. When we got to podcasting, I realized his was exactly the kind of podcast I hoped would emerge when we did the work in the early-mid 2000s. Something that starts out as a hobby, a passion, an idea, and develops into real media with regular listeners. A <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html">weblog for the ears</a> is what I called it back then.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a111201"></a>BTW, you want to know how <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/10.html#a102156">disgusted</a> I was with Maddow? I switched stations to watch the <i>Yankees</i> in the playoffs. I might have to get my head examined. The Yankees <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/yankees-putting-pressure-cracking-indians-entering-game-5-article-1.3552646">won</a>, btw. And oddly enough I find myself rooting for them (really need to see a doctor). Why? Well Cleveland is favored to win it all this year. And I love to see the favorites get knocked off their perch. Same reason I pull against the Warriors. That the Yankees are underdogs now doesn't really mean that I don't hate the concept of the Yankees. I do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/10.html#a111201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a111404"></a>Another BTW, Brian thought, like virtually everyone I meet, that I am a Brooklyn boy. Not so. Why do they think that? Wikipedia incorrectly states that I am a Brooklyn native. I was born in a hospital in Brooklyn, that much is true. But I grew up in Queens. First in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens">Jackson Heights</a>, and then in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburndale,_Queens">north Flushing</a> (near Whitestone and Bayside). Ask anyone from Queens in that era if they came from Brooklyn (as I said on the podcast) and you're likely to get a (virtual) punch in the nose. And that, my friends, is where my hatred of the Yankees comes from. These days you see people wearing Yankees hats in Queens, but not when I lived there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/10.html#a111404" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a110946"></a>It was fascinating to watch Chris Hayes and Kara Swisher together on Hayes' show last night, talking about Facebook. Swisher kept saying she thinks Facebook can get fake news under control. That idea deserves exploration, I wanted to hear more about why she thinks that. I suspect it might be right, and it's necessary imho for their survival. But I suspect they won't do it, because tech giants, and Facebook is that, don't see the <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/10/supportingStandardsWithoutAllThatNastyInterop.html">cycle</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a110946" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a111050"></a>Both Hayes and Swisher talked about the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/07/isMicrosoftDeadFeh.html#p6">cycle</a>. They talked about how once we thought Microsoft was the big threat, but now not so much. One of the other guests said it was the antitrust suit that knocked them down, but I don't think that was the reason for them becoming not-dominant. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a111050" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a111222"></a>Here's what happened in a nutshell. Microsoft achieved its moment of dominance on the shipping of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0">Windows 3.0</a>. No threats in sight. They must have had quite a party that night. IBM vanquished. Lotus, Apple, left in the dust. That was about it. Microsoft rules. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a111222" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a113313"></a>At the same time the web was booting up. Microsoft responded in a scrappy highly competitive way. And they won, for a bit. They managed to replace Netscape as the dominant browser. Then they tried to turn the web into a feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office">Office</a>. That was their basic posture re the upstarts, Google, blogs, all the things that were popping up around that time. All were apps that ran inside MSIE. A threat? Nah. Only the blogs turned into Facebook and Twitter, and Google was the glue that tied the web together. And where MSIE was stagnant and not moving (kind of like Facebook today) Firefox became the browser everyone used because it was fast and the bugs weren't so bad.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a113313" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a111711"></a>The bugs were, imho, the real downfall of Microsoft. Adware, malware, virii, they had lots of names, everyone was getting hit, and Microsoft didn't consider security their problem. It was a "third party opportunity." I remember realizing in a SLC hotel once that my laptop had been infected through the wifi network in the hotel. That's how bad it was then. Microsoft wake up, your platform is dying. They ignored all the signals. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a111711" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a113903"></a>I switched to the Mac in 2005 and never went back. No problems with malware. For me there wasn't anything intrinsically better about the Mac, it just worked and Windows and its browser was always broken or about to break. Firefox on the Mac was a great browsing experience. A lot of people switched in that period. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a113903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a114116"></a>Microsoft missed lots of opportunities to win back users, they didn't seem to care.  I don't think it was any single thing that took them down, rather a lack of awareness of the world around them, a lack of interest, curiosity. In other words they became a big company. They generate their own gravity, and people who work there become focused on that, rather than the rest of the world. That was how Microsoft knocked down IBM, by being agile and scrappy, and how Google et al did the same to Microsoft.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a114116" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a112016"></a>Facebook has done a great job of preventing the kind of malware that hit Microsoft so hard. That's like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line">Maginot Line</a>. We always prepare to fight the last war. I guess fake news is to Facebook as malware was to Microsoft. And if Facebook can't clean up this aspect of their product, they could suffer the same fate as Microsoft. Or it could be just a symptom of a larger problem, too much internal gravity and not enough outward curiosity. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a112016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a112143"></a>I think it's great that the MSNBC hosts are interested in the history of big tech. It's not hard to understand. They're just stories like gods, royalty, sex, empires and great wars, victory and vindication. In other words, it's a human story. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a112143" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a011335"></a>Ultimately the reason why Microsoft lost dominance and Facebook will is that no one gets to be dominant forever. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a011335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I get it. And I think I can explain it. Let's give it a try. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a032124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a032151"></a>I used to have a fetish for stereo equipment when I was a kid. I'd go into the city to  high end stereo stores and get demos of the best equipment. I went to the electronics show at the Coliseum. I studied the equipment bands used. I became a sound engineer. I loved everything about it. The sound systems I lusted after were more power than I could afford, the systems cost thousands and I was just a kid. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a032151" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a032340"></a>I also had fantasies about guns as a kid, like a lot of my young friends, we'd play soldier, or The Man from UNCLE, or James Bond, or Star Trek. There were lots of guns in the kid culture of the 60s and 70s.  When I was in college, at Tulane, in New Orleans, typically my roommates had guns. One took me to a firing range to learn how to shoot. I hated it. I didn't trust myself with the power. I realized I could just turn to the left and shoot someone. And they could shoot me. I couldn't wait to get out of there. I felt like I sometimes do on subway platforms. I could just jump in front of the train and be killed instantly. I step back from the platform and hold on to something to reassure myself that it's just fantasy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a032340" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a032727"></a>To some people the guns must be a combination of the lust I felt for the powerful sound systems and the weird way you feel when you can end it all with one irrevocable act. The fantasy gets better -- your country needs you to defend The Constitution. You have your guns ready for the day when you're called on. The NRA feeds the fantasy by saying who you will be defending the Constitution against. We're fighting for freedom, and our guns make it possible. More guns, get more guns. Because the country (in your fantasy) needs you. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a032727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a032927"></a>The reality is the country doesn't need you. If you ever start shooting people with your guns, you may kill others, like the guy in Las Vegas did, but you will be dead yourself a few minutes later. You are not responding to a threat. It's all in your mind. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a032927" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

			<li><a name="a100703"></a>It's going slowly as I fumble around in an old semi-familiar place. I know what I want, in user terms, but have to translate that into a database that's running on a system others can access.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a100703" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a100810"></a>My only experience with SQL was in 1978, as a grad student at <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">UW</a>, I took an introductory class to databases. I don't remember why I chose that class, maybe it was a requirement? I also don't remember how the database was set up, how we submitted our queries and how we got back the results. It's possible the work was done on punch cards and printouts. That's how long ago it was. I do remember having fun with it once I figured out what it was doing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a100810" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a102629"></a>Between then and now, I've used all kinds of data storage systems, mostly ones I wrote myself, for outliners, for the object database in Frontier, stuff like that. I only had a couple of apps in all those years that used SQL, other devs did the database work. Now I want to learn how to build these kinds of apps. I've put this off for too long.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a102629" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a100945"></a>Yesterday, I got MySQL running on my desktop Mac through MAMP. The instructions were better than with the download from the main Oracle site. But they weren't really good. It's common in this world to leave out the bridge you need to get from installing to using. In this case, they didn't tell you there's an app in the Applications folder called MAMP.app, that it put there. They also didn't tell you that you can access a local web page to find a dashboard for the MySQL server. They also never told you there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> available at the command line called mysql and you can type SQL queries at it. I figured it had to be there, why have a command-oriented language like SQL if you can't enter it interactively? All of this info should have been in a bulleted list. These are the things you need to know to get started. 1. 2. 3. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a100945" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a101345"></a>Anyway, after getting it up, and running a few commands, I quickly realized having it local will do no good, I need it on a server. I tried setting up a new server with MySQL on it, first on Amazon and then on Digital Ocean. On Amazon I went through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=pac_ps_q4&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=aurora_rds_b_pac_q42017&sc_content=aurora_e&sc_detail=amazon%20aurora&sc_category=aurora&sc_segment=webp&sc_matchtype=e&sc_county=US&sc_geo=namer&sc_outcome=pac&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!224583983660!e!!g!!amazon%20aurora&ef_id=WQkVoQAAANfCJBGW:20171006143058:s">Amazon Aurora</a>, I don't know exactly what it's supposed to be. It sounded like it was supposed to be an easy hosted way to run MySQL; it was the <i>easy</i> part that attracted me to it. This time instead of not finding the bridge, I was asked to make a lot of decisions that 1. I had no idea how to make and 2. I suspected would not make a difference for my first application. They could have made these decisions for me, with good defaults, and I probably would be using their service now. Instead after guessing at answers on the first page, offered yet another page of impossible choices. At that point I realized I was deep in a rabbit hole. I closed the tab and moved on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a101345" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a101744"></a>The problem I hit on Digital Ocean that stopped me was that I couldn't figure out how to access the database from code running on my desktop. I know it's possible. The security program I ran offered me the option to do it, but it still wouldn't accept operations from my desktop. Okay so I have to run Node on the machine, and that means I have to run Dropbox, so I can update the code as I iterate. Setting that up was problematic, because I had chosen a machine size that I didn't think was up to running Dropbox. I could start over, but I had another idea.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a101744" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a101954"></a>I have a couple of underutilized servers. I chose the one on Digital Ocean because I had been able to install MySQL there. The server already had Node installed and Dropbox. It was ready to go. I hadn't wanted to install MySQL on an existing server for fear I would do something I couldn't undo --  but at this point I had already uninstalled it once, and was pretty confident I wouldn't break anything. So I sucked in my breath, said a prayer and installed MySQL, wrote a test app in Node, and hit another wall. My new app needed the new version of Node, there was a <a href="https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/2100">problem</a> <a href="https://github.com/hapijs/boom/issues/164">with</a> the <i>request</i> package, I had seen before on another server. So I fumbled around for about an hour trying to remember how I worked around this problem last time. I ended up completely reinstalling Node and then, boom, my little MySQL app worked! It showed an error message that it couldn't find the database. Correct, I hadn't created it yet. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a101954" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a102338"></a>This morning I created the database, added a table, added a record to the table, did a query, and yaha it all worked. Now I get to think about next steps.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/06.html#a102338" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

He includes a stunning video about the rebirth of the Yellowstone ecosystem after they reintroduced wolves.

		<li><a name="a103935"></a>Anyway, no one knows what if anything will cause a rebooting of news in a constructive way that responds to the challenges of 2017 and beyond. But if such a thing exists, I suspect it has something to do with aggregation, because we need it, and the current ways we get it are so inadequate and not near the potential of the Internet to deliver.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/04.html#a103935" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a103948"></a>Aggregation is what Twitter and Facebook do for news. Neither company designed or tuned their products to news, it sort of just happened. What if there were a news aggregator that provided a customizable feed from many sources and only included vetted sources, known to at least be trying to present accurate news. I don't know if that's the wolf, but it's needed.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/04.html#a103948" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a105136"></a>Over the years the news industry has pointed the finger at every tech leader, in turn, without ever taking on the problem of net-based news distribution itself. We gave them a great start with <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. Now Facebook is to blame. All they did is ruthlessly harness the native power of the net, in a fairly crude first-approach sort of way. Lots more iteration and refinement is possible. To win it requires cooperation among the competitors in news, and that might be impossible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/10/04.html#a105136" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
