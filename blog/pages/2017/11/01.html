<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a111634"></a>A <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/40">question</a> about emoji short codes. I want a simple JavaScript function that takes a <a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/">short code</a> like :shrug: and turns it into the corresponding emoji character that is maintained, so when more emoji characters are added, corresponding short codes are added. It seems this must exist, but if it doesn't it should. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span> <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a111634" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's one of my three favorite rides. It was cold yesterday, and I had an errand to do on the east side, so I walked instead of riding. But I know the path well, esp the segment where the truck driver mowed down the pedestrians and cyclists. But here's the thing -- there weren't supposed to be any pedestrians there. It's a <i>bike</i> path. There's a much nicer walkway about 50 feet west of the bike path, right on the Hudson River. Cyclists aren't allowed there. I love that segment of the walkway, in fact it's often my turnaround spot, where I stop, take in the scene, sometimes even take a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/36654661212/in/dateposted-public/">picture</a>. But please walkers and runners, stay in your space and we'll stay in ours. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a100705" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Look at how lovely the city is by the river. There used to be an ugly eyesore of a highway where the park and bike path are now. Yes there's a small amount of violence, but actually much less than there used to be. Net-net the urban experience in the US is much-improved. To people in flyover country who hear how our cities are hellholes, Fox accidentally broadcast some evidence to the contrary yesterday. Ooops. :shrug:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a110836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a124647"></a>There is no organization repping the interest of the open web. I know people say that the EFF, Mozilla and the W3C do, but any organization that is trying to force HTTPS on the web, using the power of browser vendors to enforce it, is not repping the interests of the open web. So that cuts out EFF and Mozilla. And the W3C has unfortunately been controlled by big tech companies almost since inception. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a124647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a124835"></a>A hypothetical open-web-repping organization could come out of journalism or academia. But it would have to be rooted with two things: users and open tech. And that's it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a124835" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Some things' value come from being open to anyone, and those projects <i>consume</i> money, they don't make it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a125933" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Or any public resource that's set aside for everyone to use. That's the web. It's not here so Google and Facebook or the NY Times or Washington Post can have a business model. It's not here for them to mine, exploit and leave a wasteland where once there was promise. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a124944" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a010046"></a>The big tech companies behave like big companies. Right now there is nothing that balances that power. The journalists and academics have been in awe of them, and have been reluctant to understand the issues. I don't expect much from that combination until they get serious about protecting the resource that we all need. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a010046" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

No one gives a damn about changing your words. <i>They just want Google's money.</i> (To be fair, they want your money too if you have ads on your pages.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a010724" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a010824"></a>And if you happen to not run ads on your site, you still have to jump through the hoop so Google can preserve the impression that they are doing all this out of love (of the web).

There will always be one more thing you have to do to really get their approval, until you realize that actually never happens. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a012846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
