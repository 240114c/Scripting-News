It feels like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._jurisdiction">legal cannabis</a>. Something that was once forbidden that now is OK. It's like what, I can do that! Wow.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/09.html#a094135" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a100435"></a>One of the reasons 280 chars is great is that it means that links I post to Facebook can have longer descriptions. It may seem counter-intuitive, but I use <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> to post my links, to Twitter, Facebook, to my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a> and to an <a href="http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>. I don't write different versions for each environment, so what you get is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator">least common denominator</a>. Which is Twitter. When they up the limit, they do it for all other platforms, at least in my world. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/09.html#a100435" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a103604"></a>The 2017 election proved that the way out of our mess is with the people, not the pre-Internet political parties. This is true for everything, really. For tech, for news as well as politics. The institutions may fail, but that's not the end.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/09.html#a103604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I have an Android phone. When it rings, if they think it's a spam caller, the screen goes red and there's a label under the number that says it's probably spam. I trust Google to not use this feature to censor political opinions, though technically they could, and we would never know. I want to believe they're saying it's spam because it <i>is</i> spam. The same way I trust Google not lower the rank of a site because it doesn't support HTTPS. The fact that they do this, and are <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">open about it</a>, means I don't trust the whole move to HTTPS that they're trying to force on the internet, without any public debate, oversight or recourse. This is exactly the kind of thing Google, a company, not an elected government, should not be doing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/09.html#a112638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
