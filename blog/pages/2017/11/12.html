<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a103812"></a>Just finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(miniseries)">Big Little Lies</a>. Great acting, characters and (no spoilers) it's a story for our time. 4 out of 5 stars.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a103812" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a040144"></a>I just made a change to how permalinks and GUIDs are generated in my <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a050640">CMS</a>. This is a test post to see how badly I broke things. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a040144" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a043255"></a>Interestingly, that last post should have appeared twice because the GUID changed. I figured out how to fix things so it can survive an author time-zone change. More in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/42#issuecomment-343806486">thread</a> for this bug and its fix.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a043255" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="tweet" data-tweetId="929814312364986371" data-tweetUserName="davewiner"><a name="a034923"></a>With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._jurisdiction">cannabis legal</a> in so many states, why isn't there a cable news show that spends an hour a week exploring the changes this brings about? Such a large change, an end to Prohibition, seems there would be quite a bit of interesting stuff to discuss about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a034923" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't keep track of these things. "Senator McCain, America has been humiliated by your president and party. Enough. Time to stop this. Speak up for impeachment." BTW, this is also the most responses I've gotten on Twitter from trolls. Wondering how many of them are real people, and how many are imitation people, Russians dressing up as Americans. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a033615" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="tweet" data-tweetId="929812507581140992" data-tweetUserName="davewiner"><a name="a034311"></a>Maybe John Dickerson should interview a group of Russian trolls to get their opinions on American politics. It would be more illuminating than listening to a bunch of Americans who were brainwashed by them. Skip the middleman, go direct to the source.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a034311" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a011734"></a>Facebook replaced the web with much less than the web. This should get more attention than it does.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a011734" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a113706"></a>There was a problem with <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> this morning. I rebooted the app and all is working again. I saw that it had been running for 222 days. That's one of the advantages of working in the Node environment. Once you get a piece of software stable, in this case <a href="https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage">nodeStorage</a>, it pretty much takes care of itself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a113706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a113634"></a>Couldn't watch the last segment on Face The Nation with a panel of Trump voters. It's time to stop asking them to explain themselves. Let's hear from other citizens. And let's stop putting reporters in the middle.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/12.html#a113634" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
