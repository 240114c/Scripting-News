			<li><a name="a201903"></a>Meh -- I have some respect for it, but please, don't do another season. Homeland is in this category. Lost is halfway betw Meh and Good. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a201903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			<li><a name="a201908"></a>Good -- I watched it, maybe not all seasons, maybe not all the way through. It was entertaining. I respect the program, but I'm not sure I would recommend it. Dexter is a prototype. I got really tired of it. Also Big Love. Entourage.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a201908" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a202344"></a>My rating is the average of all seasons. For example, the first couple of seasons of Homeland were pretty good. Then it got lost, about the time F. Murray Abraham came on board. So net-net it's a Good. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a202344" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

		<li><a name="a145539"></a>The problem occurred when I traveled outside my time zone, and post something using my laptop. And it happens again, in some readers, when I return home. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a145539" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a145614"></a>To understand why, you need to understand something about how RSS works. Each item has an <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt">identifier</a> called a <i>guid</i> that uniquely identifies it. My CMS software generates each item's guid using the time it was created. For example, if a post was created at 10:38:12AM, the guid would be <i>a103812.</i> But when I move to a different time zone, say to Mountain Time from Eastern Time, the guid would change to <i>a083812.</i> A different guid, therefore the RSS reader thinks it's a new post. So you see it again in Feedly. Depending on how the reader works it might see it as a new item once again when I move back to Eastern Time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a145614" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a145659"></a>Why didn't <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> have the problem? It has another check. If two posts have exactly the same text, it figures you don't need to see it again. This protection was put in to guard against the possibility that you might subscribe to two feeds from one pub, and they might run the same item in two feeds. I reasoned you don't need or want to see it a second time. There are some pubs, like the NYT, where I subscribe to a dozen or more feeds. They might run a sports/business item in both the sports and business feeds. Because they are in different feeds, the guids don't match, so you'd see it again. So I used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristic</a> technique, that happened to also suppress this bug. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a145659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a150438"></a>The fix was simple, generate the guid using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a>, which doesn't change based on where the feed is generated. So at this point, if you see two items from this <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">feed</a> in your reader, it's some other problem. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a150438" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
