It's a bug to see your wealth as relative to other people's wealth. There comes a point, way before you're in the 1%, that more money can't buy you more than you already have that you can actually use. You can't use two bedrooms, or two cars. Owning a stadium with 50K seats does you no good because you can only sit in one. Having more money does not make you bigger. As Bill Gates said, wisely -- the hamburger is the same, no matter how much money you have. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/17.html#a184505" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
