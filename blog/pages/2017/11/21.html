<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152058"></a>Here's my page of <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/users/davewiner/">best binges</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/21.html#a152058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152130"></a>The new version of <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/">BingeWorthy</a> is released, v0.5.11. The docs have been <a href="http://this.how/bingeworthy/#1511275218000">updated</a> to show you how to create your own public ratings page. If you want tweet a link to your page, cc to @davewiner. I'll be RTing them so people can see what's up. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/21.html#a152130" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a152617"></a>Also there's a JSON version of the ratings page, so it can plug into other apps, if that's interesting. Here's the <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/users/davewiner/ratings.json">JSON version</a> of the ratings on my page. To find yours, there's a link at the bottom of your ratings page or just add <i>ratings.json</i> to the URL for your HTML page. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/21.html#a152617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154923"></a>There are also fixes and tweaks in the new version. One of the most consequential is that the browser's Find command now works in <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/">BingeWorthy</a>. With a long list of programs that scrolls off the bottom of the screen, having a Find command that works is pretty essential. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/21.html#a154923" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161830"></a>Thanks to: NakedJen for putting together the initial list of programs with help from her friends in Salt Lake City. To JY Stervinou for lots of coaching on SQL and tireless testing and feedback on the initial design and all through development. Also bad French humor. And Scott Hanson and Andrew Shell for testing help. It's so important to have people who care and pitch in as software is developed. Thank you all so much! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/21.html#a161830" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
