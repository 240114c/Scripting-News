<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a173345"></a>Good morning. I just did a switchover of my CMS. Hopefully all the pieces still fit together as they did before.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/24.html#a173345" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/24/deadwood.png"><a name="a173943"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/24/deadwood.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm working my way through <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Godless+tv+series&ia=web">Godless</a>. It's nice, but so far, three episodes in, it's not as great as the reviews say. I'd say it's about 3/5th of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a>, which came first, was more depraved, and more entertaining. That said I was just in the part of the country that it's about, southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. I think it was filmed there too. And this gives me a clear picture of what's next for <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/">BingeWorthy</a>, a diary, a place where I can take notes about programs as I work through them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/24.html#a173943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180723"></a>Godless may not be a masterpiece, but it is bingeable. Not all shows are. I find myself looking for excuses to stop working so I can get to the next chapter of Godless. They got me to care about the characters. That's the basic thing about bingeable shows. They get you to care. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/24.html#a180723" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It sounds exactly like a dentist's drill. And it's intermittent. At least when you're at the dentist you know when the drilling is going to start. (Update: I found that putting on my Bose headphones helps a lot. Hard to believe the noise cancelling function is working. The drilling seems very far away. Only downside is I can't hear my fingers on the keyboard.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/24.html#a173638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
