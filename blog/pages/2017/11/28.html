<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161543"></a>New <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/">BingeWorthy</a> feature. Now you can suggest a new program. It's very low-tech and the ultimate list that's rated is an editorial thing, it's curated.

These systems all interconnect, and when the limits are erased, good things happen.

Possibly because they saw Fox becoming Trump TV and buying CNN and Sinclair taking over local broadcasters. It's an insurance policy. They may need to have a way to speak that's independent of their competitors.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/28.html#a153240" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We need to organize around this principle. People who used to be thought of as liberal are now conservatives. Let's start talking about organizing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/28.html#a145301" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

On the net you can't tell who's pulling the strings. It could be an abused woman, or it could be a political cause or Russian oligarchs. America has an exposed surface that's vulnerable to trolling. Gender is a huge wedge, and people who play on divisions will use this, <i>are</i> using this this, to reduce us, to get us to hurt ourselves. Keep your eyes and ears, and most important, your mind, open. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/28.html#a142608" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There's the evidence of connections, meetings, emails, visits to Moscow by aides, and then there's the actions, such as the gutting of the State Dept. Why would a president, who was loyal to his country, do that? Has anyone asked? Doubtful. If it were asked, would there be an answer? Of course not. The answer is obvious according to the Occam News Service. Don was compromised in the 80s, and learned to love working for Russia. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/28.html#a142013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
