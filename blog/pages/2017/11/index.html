It's nice, but so far, three episodes in, it's not as great as the reviews say. I'd say it's about 3/5th of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a>, which came first, was more depraved, and more entertaining. That said I was just in the part of the country that it's about, southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. I think it was filmed there too. And this gives me a clear picture of what's next for <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/">BingeWorthy</a>, a diary, a place where I can take notes about programs as I work through them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/24.html#a173943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It sounds exactly like a dentist's drill. And it's intermittent. At least when you're at the dentist you know when the drilling is going to start. (Update: I found that putting on my Bose headphones helps a lot. Hard to believe the noise cancelling function is working. The drilling seems very far away. Only downside is I can't hear my fingers on the keyboard.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/24.html#a173638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Thanks to Phil Jackson and Carmelo Anthony for leaving the Knicks. I didn't know we needed the space so badly. What a great team the 2017 Knicks are. So entertaining and hopeful. I have a theory about basketball. Once teams win two championships they should disband, because there's no reason to win a third. But teams like this year's Knicks, so full of naive optimism and the joy of youth, they are the reason we watch all sport. Al Pacino's character said it so well at the end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday">Any Given Sunday</a>. Sport, like life, is about creating together. It's the friendship, teamwork, that's why we play, that's why we live. We are a social species, not designed to go it alone. Yet the myth is of the Great Man. That's Melo. And Jackson. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi%C5%86%C4%A3is">KP</a> has a different ethic. He leaves room for his friends to shine. So you get a dozen characters instead of one. I could be wrong. It could be KP is upset at all the individuality, but I sure hope not. Anyway, that's the story that is this year's Knicks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/23.html#a185305" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a190234"></a>I couldn't find Pacino's end-of-movie speech, but his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO4tIrjBDkk">inch-by-inch speech</a> is the classic, and there are lots of clips of that on YouTube. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/23.html#a190234" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134203"></a>This year I am thankful for all my friends, near and far, new and old, all genders, races, political persuasions, from red states and blue states. All we have really are each other. People who want more or think they have more are on a fool's mission. We start out as stardust and that's where we end up. In between, we hope there's time enough for fun and love and great ideas and helping each other. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/23.html#a134203" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135748"></a>I'm thankful this year for <i>women</i> friends, all of whom have #metoo stories, though not all have been told publicly. Especially women friends who tell me, with love, that they know I'm a good man, not because I needed to hear that to know it, but because it helps me feel somewhat safer. I am afraid about where we're headed, how our strings are being pulled, how men's voices are silenced in this huge debate about what it means to be a man, and where leadership will come from, and if it will be kind, and wise.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/23.html#a135748" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

People would never fall for it if it were Exxon or the NFL intead of Google or Facebook. The tech industry is every bit an American industry, meaning they'll take whatever they want until some entity with more power stops them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/23.html#a153640" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a153757"></a>One of the ideas circulating is that your ISP has a monopoly, owns the only way for you to get to the Internet, but that's an old idea, it's no longer true. Where I live the wireless vendors are just as fast as the wired ISP. The cost is still prohibitive, I still need wifi, but given an economic incentive to replace Comcast and Spectrum et al, some wireless vendor is going to step in, probably the smaller ones who aren't yet owned by one of the big ISPs. Google could buy Sprint for example, and provide a route-around. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/23.html#a153757" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a154015"></a>In other words if a market develops for neutral Internet access, there's no reason a service can't rise to meet the demand. And remember Google and Facebook have already kicked the legs out from under the web. It's on the floor screaming for mercy. These are not cuddly cute baby squirrels, they're unregulated robber barons with the best PR ever, for now at least. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/23.html#a154015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

It's a bug to see your wealth as relative to other people's wealth.

Owning a stadium with 50K seats does you no good because you can only sit in one. Having more money does not make you bigger.

At Living Videotext, our first office was a dark room in a former church on San Antonio Road in Mountain View. The church is gone, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4114991,-122.106259,3a,75y,103.11h,75.13t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2GuEo7y3_hdPAoo7SG5wnw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">land</a> is probably now part of a Google sub-campus.

The problem with the first office was that the windows didn't open and I was a smoker and they let you smoke in offices back then, even if the windows didn't open. So we made sure that the Elwell Court office had windows that opened. It was our top feature request. Then, we kept growing, and the next office was a standalone <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4203375,-122.0956367,3a,75y,125.35h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skMKj9NTMi-wniFPnqIiMkw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DkMKj9NTMi-wniFPnqIiMkw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D131.76736%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656">building</a> on Charleston Road in Mountain View.

Also, don't expect the next president to be like Trump. It doesn't work that way. He or she will be total Establishment. A real intellect. Not flamboyant or a narcissist.

		<li><a name="a145539"></a>The problem occurred when I traveled outside my time zone, and post something using my laptop. And it happens again, in some readers, when I return home. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a145539" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a145614"></a>To understand why, you need to understand something about how RSS works. Each item has an <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt">identifier</a> called a <i>guid</i> that uniquely identifies it. My CMS software generates each item's guid using the time it was created. For example, if a post was created at 10:38:12AM, the guid would be <i>a103812.</i> But when I move to a different time zone, say to Mountain Time from Eastern Time, the guid would change to <i>a083812.</i> A different guid, therefore the RSS reader thinks it's a new post. So you see it again in Feedly. Depending on how the reader works it might see it as a new item once again when I move back to Eastern Time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a145614" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a145659"></a>Why didn't <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> have the problem? It has another check. If two posts have exactly the same text, it figures you don't need to see it again. This protection was put in to guard against the possibility that you might subscribe to two feeds from one pub, and they might run the same item in two feeds. I reasoned you don't need or want to see it a second time. There are some pubs, like the NYT, where I subscribe to a dozen or more feeds. They might run a sports/business item in both the sports and business feeds. Because they are in different feeds, the guids don't match, so you'd see it again. So I used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristic</a> technique, that happened to also suppress this bug. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a145659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a150438"></a>The fix was simple, generate the guid using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a>, which doesn't change based on where the feed is generated. So at this point, if you see two items from this <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">feed</a> in your reader, it's some other problem. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/13.html#a150438" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I have an Android phone. When it rings, if they think it's a spam caller, the screen goes red and there's a label under the number that says it's probably spam. I trust Google to not use this feature to censor political opinions, though technically they could, and we would never know. I want to believe they're saying it's spam because it <i>is</i> spam. The same way I trust Google not lower the rank of a site because it doesn't support HTTPS. The fact that they do this, and are <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">open about it</a>, means I don't trust the whole move to HTTPS that they're trying to force on the internet, without any public debate, oversight or recourse.

		<li data-subs="[object Object]"><a name="a095920"></a>A discussion about HTTPS at Newsgeist led to a question.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a095920" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<ul class="ulLevel1">
			<li><a name="a101210"></a>Dave, do you really have 100s of domains with real content, and if so, how did it happen?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a101210" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
			</ul>
		<li><a name="a100009"></a>First, there really are that many. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a100009" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100724"></a>Second, the reason is that, as you may know, I use <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/09/10/twoWaysOfLookingAtAnOutline">outliners</a> for my writing. That's how I write code and blog posts, docs, change notes, show notes for my podcasts, etc. Editing structures is my thing. Then, I had the idea that a website could be a document. And made that work, and it's great. Then I tried an even bigger idea, one document could hold lots of websites. It worked too, and it also was great. (How it worked: nodes in the outline structure could have a <i>domain</i> attribute and the server would know how to get to that place from an HTTP request.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a100724" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>If you're following me this far, you can see how the domain names proliferated.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>All this is before Google even had a web browser. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100138"></a>I wrote about it publicly on my blog. I didn't hide it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a100138" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100143"></a>Later I got a little more sober about it. I was probably the only person who liked it. I created a web server called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagepark">PagePark</a> that made it easy to serve lots of domains from one machine, without any configuration. Just create a folder with the name of a domain in a specific place and the server would automatically route requests to the folder. It works. It's proven a good way to evolve sites I created, with real content, specs, essays, blog posts, feeds, JSON files, images, outlines, movies, podcasts, music, wire photos, all the things I have experimented with and created standards for over the years. It's a mess, but I kept good notes. If anyone wants to see my work, it's all there. But it's never going to make it to HTTPS unless it gets a lot simpler, and we know that can't happen because it's inherently a complicated and fragile thing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a100143" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100430"></a>Now of course Google never considered the possibility that someone might be doing this. And there are probably are <i>many other things</i> they didn't think of that people did or are doing. Remember HTTP isn't just any protocol, it's certainly the most widely used networking protocol ever. It's the protocol that made networking explode. And it's been around a long time, and lots of people did all kinds of things with it, and some of those sites are still running. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a100430" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100529"></a>Or maybe Google had an idea of how widespread HTTP was, and they don't care. I suspect that's the case, because it's pretty freaking obvious to anyone who thinks about it. ;-) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a100529" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a100613"></a>HTTP isn't some random half-baked idea, it's the biggest networking standard anywhere. No one has the power to break it. That's one of the big reasons so many innovations happened there and not somewhere else.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a100613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<ul class="ulLevel0">
		<li><a name="a110742"></a>This came up in the first session at NewsGeist. I told a short story about something not important and one of the participants said "But you're not an average user." Hmmmm.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a110742" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110818"></a>This comes up a lot in product discussions. I have never said it myself, I find the idea pretty useless. Because <i>no one</i> is the average person, and you could use that line to shoot down any idea, so why bother? It doesn't add anything to discourse.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a110818" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a110920"></a>I remember the first time I heard it, when I asked the CEO of the tech company I worked for if he had tried a product, and what did he think of it. It was one of his own products, a big moneymaker. He said "I'm a market of one." Same idea as not being an average user.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a110920" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a111706"></a>Should you be the CEO of a company whose product you don't use? Maybe if you're making a drug to treat cancer I could understand it. This was a product designed to make execs in companies more effective at their work. He was most definitely in the market the product was aimed at. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a111706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a111125"></a>So that's correct, I'm not an average user, but if you have an idea for a product that no one is currently using because it doesn't exist, then there is no such thing as an average user. And if someone says this to you in a brainstorming meeting, remember I told you to just ignore it, it doesn't mean anything. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a111125" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a111751"></a>One more thing, if you're going to develop products for a living, you have to learn how your users think. Do support work. Read their emails. Do searches on the web and social media. When you meet a user of your product, ask what they think, and listen. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/08.html#a111751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I prefer to walk through the world in my spacesuit of a body. No point looking at it, it's just my protective layer. But when I do catch a glimpse, I have the same reaction as Churchill.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a110106"></a>More Newsgeist -- the subject of the massive bit-burning that the <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/01.html#a100645">turn to HTTPS</a> will cause did come up at one of the last sessions. I was getting the usual talking points from several participants from different organizations, the ones I get when this is discussed on Twitter. Since we had <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a> I can't say who they are. It was fun to get the pushback I always get when I write about it, in real time, face to face. It's all bullshit, masking the ridiculous power grab by Google and Mozilla. If HTTPS is so necessary, then selling it on its own merits should work fine, without destroying the history of the web. I'm kind of okay with Google using it as a "signal" to determine search rank, although it's a lie and makes me think very negatively of Google. But using their dominance of browserland to <i>force</i> this, there's no justification for that, and there should be a huge anti-trust outcry over it. If I have anything to say about it, there will. My blog may not have huge traffic, but I'll use whatever I have to expose this. They call me names, but it all amounts to one thing -- they don't want to be called out.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a113019"></a>Lots of gender discussions. Earnest, well-intentioned, supportive, even at times loving. But most of it too dangerous for me, as a man, to write about in public. I will say this one thing. I heard the term "mansplaining" used several times, by people of both genders. I don't like it. I don't think you should either. <i>Man</i> is becoming a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pejorative&t=hg&ia=definition">pejorative</a> just as <i>Jew</i> was when I was growing up. I thought to be a Jew was dirty. I didn't want to be one, even though my family ran for their lives in the Holocaust, because we were Jewish. I both hated the term and myself. If the unfair effort to indict men, as a gender, continues, you're going to have a lot more angry self-hating men. If you think that's good you're crazy. You want to see how bad the term is. Imagine if the <i>man</i> in mansplaining were replaced with "jew." It's a hateful term, and if you use it, you're spreading hate. And you gotta know that's going to come back on you. No way around it. Find another way to get a person, of any gender, to listen. Without resorting to awful humiliating gender-slamming tricks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/06.html#a113019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a112227"></a>Even more Newsgeist -- Journalism should put extra effort to create high-density/quality news flows for people who really want to know what's going on. Out of that will grow new products, services, and news paradigms. It's the equiv of the way we developed first, in the 80s, for power users, and that helped us develop concentrated simplified versions for people who valued ease of use over power. That's how new ideas get developed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/06.html#a112227" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Today I'm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona">Phoenix</a>, for a future-of-news conference, and took a 1/2 hour ride around downtown on their <a href="http://gridbikes.com/">Grid</a> bike system. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/03.html#a010622" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a011959"></a>The setup is just like the one in Portland. The bikes have GPS built in, and communicate with a server. You enter your account number and PIN and it releases the bike. The UI is very confusing and the server is slow, and it falls behind when you type the numbers. It took me ten minutes to unlock a bike, and I had prepaid through their website. The cost for a tourist like me is $7 an hour. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/03.html#a011959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
		<li><a name="a010914"></a>I had no idea what downtown Phoenix is like, but the ride gave me a good view, much better than you'd get by walking or driving. Phoenix's downtown has a lot of empty space, like Oakland or San Jose in the 80s. And it's poor and outside of the main area pretty rundown. Lots of homeless and poor people. Very little sidewalk or street traffic, not many stores. An empty feel. A big arena and sports stadium. The arena must be where the Phoenix Suns play, and I'm guessing the stadium is where the Cardinals or DIamondbacks play. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/03.html#a010914" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
