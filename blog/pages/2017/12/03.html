It lulls us into believing it's all going to be over maybe soon -- but we don't know what happens if Mueller presents an airtight case. It could be nothing happens.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/03.html#a012459" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Amazon, Google, Roku, or a new AppleTV? The one I have is over five years old. And it's pretty sucky. What do you like?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/03.html#a193255" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's the story of a man who is released from death row into a small Georgia town, and all the shit that happens. I liked the first season, but now I'm getting into the middle of the second, and it's more <i>cringe </i>worthy than binge worthy. What gives? Does it get better?? Also it's got one of the worst names ever. I figured by now I might know what it means, but noooo.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/03.html#a161009" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a012541"></a>Update: I've now finished season 2. It gets better. It's still fairly cringe worthy. But it's also a little thought provoking, pitiful and a teeny bit sexy. I'm going to start season 3. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/03.html#a012541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155258"></a>Like a lot of subscribers to the NY Times I got <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/03/kristofEmail.png">an</a> <a href="http://x.e.newyorktimesinfo.com/ats/msg.aspx?sg1=5c84bf10cddbe6f611dec47f84f3aa94">email</a> from Nicholas Kristof thanking me for giving them money. Just like the politicians. Someday they'll figure out that we have much <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+expertise&t=hg&ia=definition">more</a> to contribute than money, but not yet.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/03.html#a155258" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
