<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a031154"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/50">Braintrust query</a>: I'm looking for a good website with ski area weather forecasts for the Rockies. Lots of sites have conditions at the ski areas. I want to know where the weather is. Mainly just a question of the storm track and what's coming. I suppose I could look at weather forecasts for each ski area, but that's pretty labor intensive. What I want is the overview. Any suggestions?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/07.html#a031154" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I have the opposite take. I think they're obviously true, are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">simplest</a> explanation of Trump's behavior. Trump goes to Moscow, flattered and bribed, gets in bed with Russians, it fits his lifestyle. I don't see why people don't believe it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/07.html#a161712" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

		<li><a name="a135023"></a>I understand why other Democratic senators want <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken">Franken</a> to resign, but they aren't the whole universe. They may believe the women, always, 100 percent, but the world isn't that simple. Remember all the fake trolls who threw the 2016 election and the aftermath we're dealing with now. Let the dust settle. Develop a process for dealing with this kind of situation, so next time there won't be a precedent of the man just leaving in disgrace. Franken may be guilty, or not. We have principles in this country to uphold. Just walking away makes it that much more of a problem for the next man who is accused. Don't make a clichÃ© out of <i>the presumption of innocence. </i>It's an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence">principle</a>. The Democratic senators have said their piece. Now let's have a process, and let's examine the facts. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/07.html#a135023" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
