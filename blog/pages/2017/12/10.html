<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a224705"></a>Hillary's mistake was thinking all she had to do is remind voters how awful Trump is. I saw the ads as evidence she had nothing to offer, no passion. Over and over. I wouldn't bother pointing this out now if the Dems weren't repeating this approach. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/10.html#a224705" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't think so. In Watergate you didn't have ex-presidents warning that if we don't do something, we're going to wind up in Nazi Germany. I wonder how many times we'll hear that warning, or if you only get it once, and if the next thing is that the ex-president goes into hiding. How much are the Repubs in Congress backing Trump because they like the politics or they fear for their lives? There probably won't be a point where you get a choice, go this way for salvation and the other way for hell. It may be that by the time you realize there was a choice, there no longer is a choice. A year ago we were trying to convince electors to do the sane thing and not vote for Trump. Now look where we are. If Roy Moore makes it into Congress, how many Roy Moores will follow? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/10.html#a180541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's every bit as good as the first season. No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lithgow">John Lithgow</a>, unfortunately. But still plenty of politics and intrigue and British mannerisms to keep you entertained. Stiff upper lip. Cheerio. Quite right.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/10.html#a142811" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
