It's the same codebase as the <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/">TV version</a>, but there are differences. I only include movies currently playing in theaters, and new movies on the streaming services. So if a movie opens on Dec 25, it's not in the initial database, but will be there as soon as it's in theaters. I don't know if movies will age-out of the list. We'll see how it goes. I'm using Google for search because they include showtimes in their listing and DuckDuckGo does not. Utility wins out. No strategy tax. And there are a bunch of tweaks and little improvements of course. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/11.html#a181613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When the president attacks a reporter we all follow that reporter. So <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel">@daveweigel</a> would have as many followers as @barackobama for example. Double what El PresidentÃ¨ Trump has. It's like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand Effect</a> applied to ranting authoritarian politicians on Twitter.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/11.html#a154955" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155040"></a>Another idea. An outliner you use to gather all the tweets you don't want to lose.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/11.html#a155040" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
