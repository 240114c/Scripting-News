<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a225852"></a>The Democrats need more evil. Learn to enjoy Republican suffering. They need to see McConnell lose his shit. To have Shelly Adelson tip over in his wheelchair he gets so pissed. No more bipartisan bullshit. Democrats will not be done until the Republican Party is no more. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/19.html#a225852" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And if we used the probabilities that sports teaches us, we'd be another 100 percent smarter.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/19.html#a220654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a202352"></a>New feature: <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=discuss">The Discuss tab</a>. If you go there, you'll see a box with a Disqus thread. As I write this there's one comment, a test, that says "Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends. We're so glad you could attend. Come inside come inside." There is a link to the <a href="http://guidelines.scripting.com/">comment guidelines</a> at the top of the page, from previous discussion features on this blog. From time to time I will reset the thread, starting fresh. Between resets comments will accumulate. Not sure where this is going. In the past it has gotten to be too much work to moderate the comments. Maybe this is the time we find a happy equilibrium. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/19.html#a202352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Heard a common idea, that the Trump thing is a replay of Watergate. "At this point in Watergate..." his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holtzman">guest</a> was heard to say. Dear people. <i>This is not Watergate. </i>There <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Miller_(political_advisor)">were</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon">no</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Gorka">Nazis</a> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/charlottesville-suspect-james-alex-fields-indicted-10-counts-article-1.3708991?utm_content=buffera8300&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">in</a> Watergate. The most offensive American at the time was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnTZipv03M">Archie Bunker</a>, who, like <a href="https://twitter.com/seanodotcom/status/943148418855157760">Trump</a>, was a TV character. The Mets had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_World_Series">won</a> the World Series. The Internet had <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/12/1219altair-8800-computer-kit-goes-on-sale/">barely</a> gotten started. The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo11.html">moon</a> landing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyx053CNMag">Woodstock</a> had just happened. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">Beatles</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyAAHpkJMc4">were</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break-up_of_the_Beatles">all</a> still <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/19/beatles.png">alive</a>. It was a different time. Trump is not Nixon. Nixon could be shamed. He resigned rather than put the country (and himself) through impeachment. Trump seems to revel in his own degradation and humiliation. He thrives off it. This won't go the way of Watergate. I'd give you odds. I think there will be a lot of dumbfounded people when Trump doesn't play the script the way we wish he would.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/19.html#a152903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
