<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144755"></a>If you have a comment about something I've written on <a href="http://scripting.com/">this blog</a>, you can use the <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=discuss">Discuss tab</a> to add a note. I'm using Disqus, because it's so easy, but am considering other approaches, even replacing it with a simple chat app. The comment <a href="http://guidelines.scripting.com/">guidelines</a> still apply. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/21.html#a144755" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a004637"></a>Apparently there's a march to impeach Trump in Washington on January 20 and elsewhere. Looking for a simple fast website to point to for this event. Not on Facebook. Any pointers?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/21.html#a004637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If I had a say --> In the future news will include perspectives from voters and taxpayers, people who are governed, the ideas and questions they have, without experts getting in the middle. Also "public editors" will be members of the public, not professional journalists. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/21.html#a145225" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145908"></a>Really the greatest disease of journalism is its closed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a>. No ideas can enter. It runs off its own fumes, only. Nothing can take it off course. Same assumptions apply, always, even when discredited. Allowing non-journalists access to the flow would change that in an instant. Which is why journalists are so totally opposed to it. They do not want change. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/21.html#a145908" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
