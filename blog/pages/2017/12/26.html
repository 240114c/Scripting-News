Don't say it. It's super disrespectful. Let everyone speak for themselves.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/26.html#a002440" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And the chances to speak out are passing us by. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/26.html#a004223" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180408"></a>Holding the line with the FBI is a better situation than last year with the  Electoral College. Then we were pushing for a function of government to assume more than the normal power. With the FBI, we're demanding they be allowed to do what they always do, investigate and indict. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/26.html#a180408" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153646"></a>Some people, esp in tech and journalism, think if you're nice to them, or help them, that you must want something from them. I have to admit that <i>sometimes</i> I do want something, but I try to keep that decoupled from what I'm doing at the moment. No need for a quid pro quo. But I don't mind reciprocation. It's a subtle distinction. Anyway, I don't think I've ever posted this. I really actually like helping people. It makes me feel good. Esp when they do something powerful with the help. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/26.html#a153646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
