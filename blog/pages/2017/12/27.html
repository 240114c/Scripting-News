<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a170454"></a>Announce: <a href="https://github.com/scripting/electricPork">Electric Pork as open source</a>. I like to start developer projects at this time of year, when people have time to poke around and think and try ideas out. This year, I'd like to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/55">introduce a shell</a> that I've created for Electron apps called electronLand. It hooks into <a href="https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage">nodeStorage</a> and Twitter for identity and storage. I use this framework in <a href="http://publicfolder.io/">Public Folder</a>, <a href="http://instantdave.com/">Instant Dave</a> and <a href="http://pork.io/electric/">Electric Pork</a>. I also have some unreleased projects that use electronLand. When it's ported all the projects should port as well. And the framework could prove useful to others, I hope. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/27.html#a170454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The moment was defined by the Library of Congress hooking up with Twitter. Blogs desperately needed preservation at the time.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/27.html#a163709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180001"></a>You know how NRA supporters say "it's too soon" to politicize gun violence. In the same way, even more so, it's too soon to politicize the Mueller investigation. Wait until there's an outcome, then if you object let your concerns be known. In the meantime be quiet. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/27.html#a180001" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a183311"></a>Hint to political parties and news orgs. Come up with ways for citizens to help, to belong, to participate. I take pride in <a href="https://bikeangels.citibikenyc.com/">helping Citi Bike</a> in NYC, even though it's a private corp. People <i>want</i> to help good causes.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/27.html#a183311" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
