There are two kinds of posts, singular items, and titled items. This post is a singular item. Both kinds appear on the home page and on the archive pages. But now titled items also appear on their own pages. For example, here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29/160005.html">titled item</a> from earlier today on its own page. And here's the <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html">archive page</a> for today. You may, in some RSS readers, see all the titled items from the month of December repeated, because their permalinks have changed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a232730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a153736"></a>I started watching the Netflix series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_(TV_series)">Travelers</a> and I liked the first couple of episodes, but now four episodes into season 1 they seem to have run out of ideas. I'm looking for bingeable entertainment. I think I've watched all the good stuff.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a153736" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a165231"></a>It's disgusting the way Repubs attacked NY and Calif with their tax plan. An idea for a counter-attack: tax all income over $1 million at 100 percent, and accompany it with a statement. We will restore the tax to what it was when the Repubs undo their attack. That would get a conversation going between the rich folk who own the rest of us. What would NY/Calif do with the money? Pay its citizens to move to Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, etc. And vote. It wouldn't take many expat NYers to turn those states blue. I know it's a hardship, that's why they have to be paid, well, for their sacrifice. Like the bonus people get for giving up their seats on overbooked flights.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a165231" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's when the <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/12/17/whatIfTheRiaaHadEmbracedNapster.html">dam</a> broke, when music programming became something we can do for ourselves. It's hard to remember how it used to work, we were so controlled by the scarcity of music. After Napster, we assume we can listen to anything we want.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a162110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Let me explain.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29/160054.html" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a160116"></a>First, Roy Moore is a crazy candidate. A total looney bird. Would only be worse if he wore a Gestapo outfit while he rode his horse to the polls. His insanity would appeal to a very small group of people, normally, but Alabama is not normal. You could nominate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer">Jeffrey Dahmer</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson">Charles Manson</a> and they'd probably get elected as a Repub in Alabama, any time except now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a160116" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a160205"></a>Trump has shown us where crazy gets us. People are tired of it. Even solid Republican voters. Exhausted, and it's only getting worse. Enough that <i>Roy Moore lost to a Democrat. </i>Mitch McConnell <a href="https://www.apnews.com/cfe1852e997043e3b4d41c08e296e1ea">noted</a> that this was in the reddest of red states. That's a signal to every other state. Nominate a lunatic and no matter if you're Mississippi or Texas or Wyoming or Alaska, the Democrat is going to win. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a160205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a160337"></a>So... some red states will nominate moderate Repubs instead of the normal Tea Party asshole. And others will go ahead and nominate someone who's as crazy as Trump or Moore. Either way, politics won't scare us as much in the next cycle. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a160337" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a160441"></a>However, that's not to say that the Repubs who are nominated, crazy or moderate, won't take their orders from the same billionaire assholes, the Kochs, Adelsons, Mercers, etc. Their form of lunacy won't go away any time soon.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/29.html#a160441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
