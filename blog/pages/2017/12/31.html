<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182825"></a>Source of a frustrating bug. Properly use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch">try/catch</a> to catch all errors, even in brand-new code. Fail to report an error in one branch. Forget to <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require">require</a> the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html">fs</a> package. But the error is inside the try, so the runtime doesn't trip an error either. Have the debugger not go into the code that has the error for some reason I won't try to determine. 1 hour later, unwind the mess. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/31.html#a182825" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a183329"></a>From a thread on Facebook. "Boulder is great, but Denver can't be bad, it's Just that Boulder is relatively small, easy to grasp, like one of the towns on the peninsula in the Bay Area. I also like Santa Fe and Taos. Beautiful houses, low cost. Skiing right there. And New Hampshire and the Berkshires. I like places that have legal cannabis, says something about the voters even if you don't partake. But I couldn't live in Calif again, feels soulless to me. Not homey."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/31.html#a183329" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Over the years I've never seen a vendor <i>really</i> try to tap into the power of independent developers. Everyone makes a first try, hit the same wall and bounce off it in predictable ways, usually giving up on getting much power from developers. So many examples. There's an art for compensating developers and choosing the ones you're going to work with. Yes you will piss people off. I imagine in Hollywood when they cast a movie the people who aren't chosen are pissed. But that doesn't stop them from making movies. There's a way to do it, and the vendor that gets it right will enjoy longevity and huge PE ratio. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/31.html#a165834" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a170835"></a>Developers, here's how I suggest you think about the Twitter API. Pretend that up until 2018, Twitter didn't have an API. On January 1, there's an announcement. Twitter now has an API. Forget about the history. It's a fucking gift I tell you. Really works. I love building on it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/31.html#a170835" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>This sounds terrible. Right? Well, it's just like Shariah Law or "chain-immigration." It sounds like a technical thing, but in reality it's a problem they made up. In practice nothing really is lost. XML sometimes garbles stuff if it isn't properly encoded. The solution is to properly encode it. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/31/202142.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>By pointing at this and saying Oooooh silent data loss. Oooh RSS is bad, people who didn't understand would think, oh I need to change to use this new thing. Or so the proponents hope.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/31/202142.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Just like Shariah Law is not a problem in America, and chain-immigration simply means letting families come to the US (a good thing, most people would think, so why not say it that way, hah), the tech trolls were saying basically that "RSS is XML," which their format was too. If everything is done right (a big assumption) you could possibly avoid "data loss" by using their format, or you could stick with RSS and properly encode the text. The latter approach is MUCH cheaper.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/31/202142.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Anyway, by the time you explained it the people listening were tuning out because it truly is boring, and thinking you're being pretty defensive, there must be something here.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2017/12/31/202142.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
