This should be an interesting year. Lots of decentralization and networking. More diverse voices heard. New tools developed. Less waiting for BigCo's to hear us. A way around the monoculture of journalism? A mind bomb every day. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/01.html#a150726" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There's nothing like a long brisk walk in the cold in NYC. For one thing, the streets are pretty empty. And because it's so cold you can really get your engine going and not overheat. I think I must be like some trees, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_requirement">need</a> a hard frost to reset, to feel the time passing. In California, I'd go "Oh shit another incredibly beautiful day." I like nice weather as much as the next guy. But <i>all</i> nice weather? No, not good for Mr Dave.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/01.html#a151345" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152712"></a>I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/04/03/offenseOnPrinciple.html">this piece</a> in 2015 about an exchange on my blog in 1994. "I try not to get offended on principle," a friend wrote. Which freed me to write what I see. If we all adopted that value, the net would be a much more usable space.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/01.html#a152712" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a173034"></a>The net has empowered people, that's good, but it's not good when it empowers people to silence others. Our system of government in the US is designed to protect minorities. It's true that only applies to the government, but it doesn't make it okay for mobs on the net and supposedly professional journalists to silence people with unpopular opinions. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/01/172842.html#a173034" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
