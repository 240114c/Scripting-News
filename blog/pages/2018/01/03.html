<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a204758"></a>Here, on the Internet, no one cares what you think. Seriously. So you can relax about making sure "everyone" knows what you think. "They" are not listening. This is all an illusion. Go enjoy your life, whatever remains of it. Nukes could be raining down on you any day.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/03.html#a204758" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a203825"></a>I was watching MSNBC on Election Night. They had <a href="https://21stcenturyfaketoys.tumblr.com/post/157898390903/00152">Kellyanne Conway</a> on. She was blaming someone, I forget who, for Trump's losing. Chuck Todd observed, after the interview, see the blame game is already starting.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/03/203806.html#a203825" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a203856"></a>We all let out a sigh of hopefulness. Only to have it shattered in an hour or two. But there was no doubt she was so sure they were going to lose she didn't wait until the results were in to start bashing whoever it is she was ready to bash. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/03/203806.html#a203856" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

But not widely enough imho. Here's a <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeLakoff/status/948424436058791937">Twitter thread</a> he wrote yesterday, saying that when you RT a Trump rant, even if you're calling him out, you're just helping him, so don't do it.  This is a variant of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/28/dontFeedDjTrump.html">2016 piece</a> I wrote, where I explained how trolling works. Yet last night, on MSNBC, they obsessed over the idiotic tweets Trump put out in real time. Instead of focusing on some really big news that had come out. (Sarcasm follows.) Gee I wonder if that's a coincidence? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/03/143131.html#a143140" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143348"></a>I have a new policy. If you quote-tweet Trump, I will unfollow you. I will also break one of my own rules in doing so (Don't slam the door on the way out) and will warn you once or twice. Then it's goodbye. I wish everyone would do this. Then the well-intentioned idiots who add velocity to Trump's tweets might get an idea that it costs them followers to give flow to Trump, and might stop doing it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/03/143131.html#a143348" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
