Too much emphasis on the legal case against him. Too many lawyers. It's really easy and cheap to pick up on the scandal du jour in the NYT and invite lawyers to discuss it, but I want to also be informed on what the government is doing. We can "track" the case against Trump as one of the stories, but it's not the only one. What's going on in Puerto Rico, Pakistan, Israel, legal marijuana (Maddow did cover this yesterday, to her credit). I'm thinking of giving up my nightly habit of two hours of MSNBC with a bit of CNN added-in. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05.html#a135111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154013"></a>Writing and publishing threads on Twitter is a big deal. Twitter is adding the feature to the core product, but <a href="http://pork.io/">pork.io</a> is more of an editor, it automates a bunch of things that Twitter makes you do by hand, such as wrapping tweets, numbering them, adding hash tags. It also creates an RSS feed of your threads, so they can be shared in other environments. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05.html#a154013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165350"></a>Bipartisanship isn't just between Repubs and Dems. It's also between bloggers and journalists. And also men and women. Working together. We find so many reasons not to. How about changing the conversation, and looking for ways we can.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05.html#a165350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a013456"></a>This is not Watergate, it's not going to go that way. I like the "stenography" approach, it's a breath of fresh air in a reporting world that's headed to a dead end. Embrace and extend. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/012744.html#a013456" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a012825"></a>Wolff is a freelancer, and sat his keister down and listened. Good reporting technique. At the same time, the network and bigpub reporters were in the press room being spun and lied to by Spicer and Sanders. Why weren't <i>they</i> sitting on the couch (where ever it is, I'd like to see a picture, btw).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/012744.html#a012825" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a012931"></a>This weekend everyone in Congress will (hopefully) be reading the book. Now they know that <i>we</i> the public know what you all know. Reporters -- stir this up and make a new cake. Get out of the this-is-Watergate rut. It is not Watergate.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/012744.html#a012931" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

It's full of big ideas, but we don't need inspiration, we need Facebook to rejoin the open web, to simply peer with it.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/141003.html#a141013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141133"></a>Facebook owes its existence to the open web. If it didn't exist Facebook wouldn't have been possible. But instead of feeding it, the way a smart corporation maintains a natural resource on which it depends, they've done the predictable thing, they've exhausted it, polluted it, cut it off, left it to die. Google does it too, and together they are destroying the <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/27/0724.html">commons</a> that serves as the incubator for new ideas, for new Facebooks and Googles, new literary forms, new ways of delivering news. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/141003.html#a141133" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141304"></a>The fact that I have to post a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/05/zuckerbergNewYear.png">screen shot</a> of his message is a perfect demo of the problem. I could have posted this on Facebook, but then I wouldn't have been able to use links, style or images. The post couldn't have a title. And if I wanted to include a podcast I couldn't. Or I could post it on my blog, as I have, and link to the screen shot, because who knows what you'll see if I post a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104380170714571?pnref=story">direct link</a> to the message. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/141003.html#a141304" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142240"></a>Let's work together. I want the best of the open web and Facebook, and Mark you're in the way of that. You'll have done a full year's worth of work if you let Facebook rejoin the open web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/141003.html#a142240" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
