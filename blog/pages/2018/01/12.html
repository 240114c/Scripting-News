I think this is the first <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html#5">post</a> about it. Not very specific. We were already working on it, but we hadn't yet hooked up with the people at Microsoft. From a quick scan it looks like the actual protocol we standardized on didn't come out publicly until June. Pretty sure we had something working internally at UserLand in March or April.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12.html#a191945" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a192739"></a>Ooops. We missed the 20th anniversary of <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. The format that became RSS was rolled out in December 1997. Here's the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html">piece</a> where that was announced. I guess we missed the party.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a194016"></a>It's really weird, the date on the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html">piece</a> is wrong. It was December 27, not December 15. You can see that in the copy, it talks about being between Christmas and New Years. And mentions a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/23/newGlasses.html">piece</a> that wasn't written until December 23. And I actually remember that this was on the 27th. Somehow, at some point, my CMS screwed this up. Which is weird because this is a static file. Looks like it was rebuilt some time in 2004. In any case if anyone wonders, the date is incorrect. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12.html#a194016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a141843"></a>I watched <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/mtp-daily">MTP Daily</a> yesterday. For a few minutes, and then went back to work. It's an awful awful show. The worst of the worst. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/140554.html#a141843" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHkPadFK34o"><a name="a141022"></a>I hate the show because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Todd">Chuck Todd</a> only talks about the horse race. I swear, the day after the 2016 election he was already talking about how people were "positioned" for 2020. This kind of analysis never means anything. Go back and listen to the talk about the 2016 election <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHkPadFK34o">in 2015</a> for a clue.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/140554.html#a141022" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141058"></a>And they don't even think about elections in a realistic way. Yesterday they were talking about how the Dems failed to sell competence last time (Hillary), so they probably shouldn't try that again. I wonder if they listen to themselves. There was a time, believe it or not, when both parties nominated people who were fairly competent. Even Ronald Reagan, who people thought was a joke, had served as governor of California before becoming president. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/140554.html#a141058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141214"></a>Anyway, assuming competence is an attribute like hair color or gender, height or whatever, the next election is <i>exactly</i> the time to be selling competence. Why? Because the electorate <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/09/145558.html">flip flops</a>. We always elect the opposite of what we elected last time.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/140554.html#a141214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a141309"></a>Trump is a complete idiot, drooling at the mouth, and Obama has a law degree, is a professor, a total technocrat who probably aced every test he took.

	<li><a name="a141238"></a>Extrapolating, the next president will probably be a woman, obviously -- but bland and reliable, not too old, known for listening and studious, even pious, and not rich.

	<li><a name="a141613"></a>Although I don't know much about her, I would take a good look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar">Amy Klobuchar</a> from Minnesota. She's intelligent, passionate, confident, speaks well, has a sense of humor, is well-educated, young but not too young, thoughtful, and has the right values to start to undo the damage done by Repubs during the reign of Trump.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/140554.html#a141613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142011"></a>Why not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Gillibrand">Kirsten Gillibrand</a>? She has many of the same qualities as Klobuchar, but she's from New York. I come from NY too, but I don't think our president should. NY is our largest city, but it's actually a pretty small place. Trump stood out in NY, but we're seeing how that doesn't work globally. But even if it's great to have a president from NY, remember we flip-flop, and I'd say the odds of two consecutive presidents from NY is pretty slim. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/140554.html#a142011" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142302"></a>Anyway, as you can see, there are some interesting things to think about for 2020, even though it's so far away. Of course they discussed none of this on MTP Daily yesterday.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/140554.html#a142302" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143502"></a>PS: You want a courageous Democratic ticket? Klobuchar for president with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Ellison">Keith Ellison</a> as VP. Unlike most Democrats these two can complete a sentence without sounding like an idiot. Both from Minnesota, btw, but look at how different they are. They say to white men who vote Trump, fuck you -- you had your chance, this is the way things look now. Get a pair, growth the fuck up and let's really start winning. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/12/140554.html#a143502" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
