<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a001909"></a>I changed the header image from the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/10/snow.png">snowy winter scene</a>, to <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/14/mlkAtRally.png">Martin Luther King</a>, in honor of his birthday tomorrow. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14.html#a001909" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a232035"></a>Can you imagine what would have happened if the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/14/message.png">Hawaii message</a> had happened in NYC or DC. The panic would have been unreal. People would have died. And the odds of a retaliatory strike would have been there too. This is how wars start, btw. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14.html#a232035" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a172018"></a>Yesterday Mathew Ingram, a longtime friend and professional journalist, put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/952214692918734848">call for feeds</a> for a reboot of his use of <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/172804.html#a172018" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a180550"></a>This got me thinking. What if a community created such a list of feeds, and did it over a period of weeks or months, with discussion, and a certain amount of deliberation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/172804.html#a180550" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a172846"></a>We could use the tools of open source to do this project. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/172804.html#a172846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a172905"></a>So, I've set up a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists">new GitHub repository</a> where we can work on that <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists/blob/master/list.txt">list</a> of feeds. I'll write a small piece of software that periodically turns that collection into an OPML file suitable for use in a feed reader. From there who knows what happens, but just getting a list of feeds for journalists to follow, collaboratively, while it doesn't involve much work or technical know-how, would be a major improvement over the way we all do this individually, for ourselves. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/172804.html#a172905" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a155250"></a>Following up on yesterday's <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/13/183433.html">report</a> on River5's file reading problem at startup, with futher thought I realized I did <i>not</i> have a solution to the problem. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/155244.html#a155250" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155309"></a>The way I proposed doing it yesterday would have resulted in just as many lost items at startup. The problem was that the central routine was sending the JSON text of the file to each of the callbacks. Each would then parse the text, producing a structure which it would then link into the cache. Only one of the structures would survive in the cache, the last one linked in, and it would have one of the new items. The other new items would be lost. In other words, no improvement.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/155244.html#a155309" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155506"></a>So I changed the code and had the central routine parse the text, and call each of the callbacks with the resulting structure. Now all the callbacks add their items to the same struct, (unless I'm still missing something) and the result is zero lost items.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/155244.html#a155506" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155618"></a>I've created a gist with the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/6236ae821789e5f89b6d6e724322c546">new code</a>, and left the old gist in place. I have not yet released a version of River5 that uses this new approach. Testing it here first then thinking about how I want to deploy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/155244.html#a155618" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155949"></a>Note this version is more complex because it has to initialize the struct once and only once, so the central routne, readRiverFile, must receive a callback that initializes the structure when the read fails, which it will do when the river file is first created.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/14/155244.html#a155949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
