<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162951"></a>The "glory days" of news readers are as irrelevant as the print edition of the NY Times. News readers were never that good. Twitter and Facebook are better as news readers. New news flows demand new approaches. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/15.html#a162951" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a235247"></a>He points out that the new method I proposed for adding items to rivers not only is more complex than the current method, and therefore more difficult to maintain, something I totally concur with, it still has a synchronization problem. Copying a pointer and deleting an object can't be an atomic operation. it's still possible something will be added to a queue betw the two steps. And that would result in a lost item. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/15/234534.html#a235247" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a234548"></a>We're now somewhat in the weeds, possibly, but we all agree it's better to have an approach that loses zero items, than one that maybe loses one item on (possibly) rare occasions. So I have proposed yet another approach in a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5/issues/14#issuecomment-357813407">comment</a>. This one has the advantage of retaining the current simplicity and hding a bell/whistle that didn't need to be there in the first place. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/15/234534.html#a234548" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a154521"></a>I started this project because I am sure that unless news thrives on the net we are totally screwed. I've never felt that we could trust Facebook to be the official distribution system for journalism on the net. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/15/153159.html#a154521" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154535"></a>This is the first step to creating many distribution nets, so a competitive market can develop. I've bootstrapped successful tech projects before. This is how it begins! It's not that hard, it just requires cooperation and a clear goal.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/15/153159.html#a154535" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
