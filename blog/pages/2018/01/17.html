<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160928"></a>Back when blogging was young, I was the chief blogger in some sense. I got a lot of shit. I was surprised then, not now. The picture people painted wasn't me. Reading their stories, I sounded like the little capitalist dude in the Monopoly game.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/17.html#a160928" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a154453"></a>I read this <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/15/aids-panic-trump-haitians-216324">Politico piece</a> about this history of Trump and Haiti.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/17/154439.html#a154453" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154502"></a>Initially there was some bad data about a possible connection betw Haitians and AIDS that soon turned out to be false. But Trump kept bringing it up, and the stink on Haiti wouldn't go away. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/17/154439.html#a154502" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a154531"></a>Reading this reminds me of the stink that people in tech put on RSS. There never was anything wrong with RSS, no data behind any of the things that were said, but people, some who even thought we were friends, said some very ugly Trump-like things about RSS. (Actually even worse.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/17/154439.html#a154531" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154612"></a>That's the sad thing about Trump, not just that he is such a flawed awful human being who is our president, but that if you live long enough, you've met plenty of other people who take exactly those kinds of shortcuts just to hurt other people. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/17/154439.html#a154612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
