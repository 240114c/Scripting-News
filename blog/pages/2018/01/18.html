I let a domain expire, thinking it wasn't in use. Haha. Okay. I renewed it. It seems to be resolving here, so the outage should be over. Sorry. I'll be more careful in the future. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/18.html#a183200" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Reporters using blogging tools is not blogging. Bloggers are reporters' sources. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-end-of-the-awl-and-the-vanishing-of-freedom-and-fun-from-the-internet">They say</a> blogging is over because their professional CMSes caught up? They're in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">bubble</a>. A profession that should be <i>good</i> at listening only actually listens to itself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/18.html#a200203" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

That's all there is to say about us. Your father, brother, son, uncle, cousin, friends, we only exist to hate women. That of course is not true. I think what we all want, men and women, is to relax, to be loved, to feel safe, pleasure, acceptance, and secure for the moment. That's imho most of what we're looking for in love. No specific gender.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/18.html#a201844" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But we keep hearing from them. How about Clinton voters next. And black voters. And people who didn't vote. And so on.
