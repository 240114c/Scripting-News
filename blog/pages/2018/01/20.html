	<li><a name="a220647"></a>The news orgs that report this way would be rated highest by the experts, no doubt. But we need news to be better. It's the one thing I agree about with Trump supporters. The standard "trusted" news attaches to ideas that they won't let go of. And reports on non-news endlessly. Can we rate that kind of stuff way way down?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/20/220532.html#a220647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Find a way for the users to decide. I know they don't trust us, but we're all we got. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/20/220532.html#a220919" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a215546"></a>In Node.js, is there a way to do interprocess communication between Node apps? I could set it up so both apps have an HTTP server, and the apps could communicate using <a href="http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/">XML-RPC</a>, so at that level I know it's possible, but I'm wondering about a different, higher-performance, approach.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/20/213336.html#a215546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a213553"></a>Suppose I launch two apps from my app. I would do it exactly the way the <a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever">forever</a> utility does it. Is there some way for an app to call back to <i>forever, </i>and is there a way for <i>forever</i> to call into the app?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/20/213336.html#a213553" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a213732"></a>This is what we tried to do on the Mac with Frontier. We never convinced Apple to stay out of the way so we could do it. But in Node, with its open source culture, if there was a way for <i>forever</i> to do it, that means there's a way for you and I to too, because of course <i>forever</i> is open source. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/20/213336.html#a213732" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
