	<li><a name="a175904"></a>Talking with a friend, he said back in the day we trusted the people who gave us the news. Walter Cronkite was his example. "And that's the way it is." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/21/173411.html#a175904" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a175939"></a>I thought for a moment, he certainly <i>seemed</i> trustworthy, but viewed in hindsight, they were telling us lies, some big, some very big.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/21/173411.html#a175939" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>TV made me want to become one of the people on TV. They were happy. We couldn't be happy until we were one of them. I remember as a kid firmly believing this was true. They knew everything, were infinitely wealthy, had everything they wanted, were loved by everyone they met. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/21/173411.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Walter Cronkite, who may not have been aware he was selling that lie, was selling it all the same. It wasn't until I was well into adulthood that I realized that it was a lie. I had given up a lot, aspiring to greatness. Only to learn there is no such thing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/21/173411.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>So yes, I think we did trust Walter Cronkite, but here's the thing, we shouldn't have.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/21/173411.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-subs="[object Object],[object Object]"><a name="a144949"></a>Most of the XML vs JSON stuff is <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=bullshit">bullshit</a>, but <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11446984">this one</a> is not. Having worked extensively with both formats, I have to say <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jerf">jerf</a> has got it right. But there are two criteria that need to be added:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/21/145156.html#a144949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1">
	<li><a name="a145030"></a>4. If the format was designed before JSON existed, use XML.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/21/145156.html#a145030" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145059"></a>5. If there already is an XML format that does what you're doing, it's better to just use it, instead of inventing a new "better" one in JSON, because you'll still have to support the XML way of doing it, and net-net that's more complicated, more work and more confusing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/21/145156.html#a145059" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
