<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a221232"></a>I wish I had a time machine so I could travel to the future and read the history books to find out why all the Repub congresspeople retired back in 2018.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/31.html#a221232" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Pretty good chance that's where we're going in the USA. Let's get it out now, in the form of a book, before they've completely locked down the press, and get it out in print, so it survives after the rule of law is gone. We can do a lot at this point to help ourselves on the "other side." Listen to Trump. He wants to control speech. He's probably figured out how to get there. 2017 was a year of learning for him. Now he understands what he's up against. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/31.html#a214736" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a200204"></a>Changed my <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/31/twitterMotto.png">Twitter motto</a> to -- "Blogging is thinking aloud into an outliner that has a Publish button on it." It was previously "I've been blogging as long as there's been blogging."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/31.html#a200204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a200027"></a>Light blogging the last few days. I'm head-down on a new piece of software, it's taking most of my attention. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/31.html#a200027" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a051341"></a>Every blog should have a <i>Subscribe</i> button. In an open ecosystem this is a problem, a problem that silos don't have. Which is the advantage Twitter (a silo) has over the open web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/01/31.html#a051341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
