My experience with cross-posting to silos is that it doesn't work. I wrote a comment on his post relating my experience.

	<li><a name="a160502"></a>Hi Dries -- I use Facebook and Twitter, and have no plans to stop either, but the primary place I write is my blog. I tried to make cross-posting work, for years, and finally realized it cant work, unless each of the silos want it to, and of course none of them do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/06/160216.html#a160502" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I also included Medium in my attempt to set up a cross-posting system.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/06/160216.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a160602"></a>I wrote this <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/04/endingAnExperiment.html">blog post</a> when I gave up. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/06/160216.html#a160602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a160640"></a>I do however mirror my linkblog to both Twitter and Facebook, and the <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links tab</a> on my blog, and its own <a href="http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>. I guess that's a POSSE approach. I use my own linkblogging software, <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/06/160216.html#a160640" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a160734"></a>That's about as good as you can get. Cross-posting blog posts imho doesn't and can't work. Links? That works.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/06/160216.html#a160734" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
