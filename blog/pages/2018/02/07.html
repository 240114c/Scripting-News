Chill out, maybe with a vape, munchies, a Netflix movie, maybe Big Lebowski. Comfortable shoes.

It's only fair to call out one for doing it well. Here's a new <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/trumpinc">podcast</a> from WNYC. Over on <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/07/trumpIncHomePage.png">the left</a>, impossible to miss, is a Subscribe button. Click it, and see a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/07/menu.png">list of choices</a>, one of which is <a href="http://feeds.wnyc.org/trumpinc">via RSS</a>. It links to the <a href="http://feeds.wnyc.org/trumpinc">podcast feed</a>, ready to subscribe to, which I have done in <a href="http://podcatch.com/">Podcatch.com</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/07.html#a230719" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a230120"></a>One of the things I've learned is that contrary to popular belief you <i>can</i> make (some) people change -- if they were depending on you not changing. You have to change first. Then, too bad, they have to change too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/07.html#a230120" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The cost of what Mozilla et al are <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/15/secure-contexts-everywhere/">planning</a> is that we will lose almost all of the archives of the web. A massive <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-moment-for-all-of-our-data-lost-in-time-260a54fef86">bit-burning</a>, which is just as awful as it sounds. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/07/194120.html#a194127" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
