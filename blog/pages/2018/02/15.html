<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a173655"></a>I'm going through stuff from my mom's house. For example, here's an <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/15/eveLeonWeddingInvitation.png">invitation</a> to my parents' wedding on Christmas Day 1953 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Lane_Hotel_(Manhattan)">Park Lane Hotel</a> in NYC. Interestingly it's not far from where I live today. Of course I wasn't even a twinkle in my father's eye at the time (I was born in 1955). By posting it here I hope to be able to find it in the future. BTW, my grandfather's name is listed on the invite as "Rubin" but no one called him that. He was Rudy and was the superstar celebrity of the family. My grandmother, Lucy, was the real power. I bought a domain to commemorate him, appropriately named <a href="http://rudykiesler.com/">rudykiesler.com</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/15.html#a173655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174237"></a>BTW, I think of it as "my mom's house" but in fact it's the house I grew up in. Weird how perceptions change. Until 2009 it was "my parents' house" and until 1976 it was "my house."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/15.html#a174237" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a181001"></a>A <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/15/thinkTankAd1985.png">ThinkTank ad</a> that ran full page in PC Week some time in 1985. There's no date on the ad, or on the article on the other side of the page. The ad looks a lot better than the scan. And the fine print didn't make it on the scan, so I did another <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/15/fineprint.png">scan</a> with just that info. My signature, in 1985, had a lot of detail that's since been lost. Back then I did a lot more writing, so my handwriting was more important than it is now, where all my writing is done on a keyboard, and has been for decades. Also years of being a CEO and having to sign stacks of things did a number on my signature too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/15.html#a181001" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a171857"></a>Stop. It's not about specific gun laws. The problem is the NRA. Make it unacceptable for a politician to take money from the NRA. Then, and only then, can the political discussion of mass-killing guns start to become rational. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/15.html#a171857" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Note that laptops didn't exist yet, but they were about to, and btw, I knew. I was non-disclosed and had a prototype of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General-One">Data General One</a> which was more or less the first.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/15/181939.html#a182511" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a182556"></a>I got credit in William Safire's NYT column for coining the term laptop, even though I didn't. It was already in use at the time. Friends said I shouldn't have been so honest, Safire's column on language was authoritative. But wtf, I have a hard time taking credit for other people's innovation. Go figure. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/15/181939.html#a182556" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
