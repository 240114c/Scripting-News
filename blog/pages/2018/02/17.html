<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a000201"></a>In 1992, my company, UserLand Software, shipped Frontier, a scripting environment and object database for the Mac. I came across a Frontier box the other day and took a picture of the front and back of the box, and <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/17/frontierBox.pdf">saved it as a PDF</a>. Hopefully we'll be able to find it in search engines in the future. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/17.html#a000201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

All of a sudden change seems very possible, as Sterling's theory predicts. It's remarkable to me how fixed-in-place you get until a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/14/eatdrinkandbejerry.html">big tree falls</a>, and now there's new light shining on new life. Not surprising that I wrote that <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html">blog post</a> a couple of weeks after <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/03/fathersDay.html">Father's Day</a> in 2009. And it's pretty cool that my mind took me back to it at this moment, the bookend for Father's Day (which for some reason I'm not calling Mother's Day, probably because that doesn't do it justice, no matter how influential fathers are, mothers are where we came from).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/17.html#a155140" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Like many stories about #metoo, it's condescending, threatening, disrespectful even humiliating to men. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/17/133924.html#a134030" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135006"></a>This is one reason men are scared to be alone with women. I feel it, when I'm alone in an elevator with a woman I don't know. I move as far away as I can, and shrink my body to be as small as possible. I'm wary of making smalltalk with women I don't know. I have no idea how they'll interpret it. Or when I called the front desk of the hotel to ask for help with the TV and a woman shows up. You're trusting this person with your reputation, every time. Yes I know, you <i>want</i> me to experience it. You got it, I'm experiencing it. But the taunting? Taking about me masturbating and locking women in my office? That is exactly the problem. We're afraid you're giving every wrong deed done by all men to each of us, no matter how we, as individuals, actually relate to women. That's why it feels safer to follow <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Mike+Pence+rule&t=hg&ia=web">Mike Pence's rule</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/17/133924.html#a135006" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135253"></a>Humiliating us isn't going to make us more comfortable, and as long as we have a choice, many will choose to stay safe. I get how this is unfair to women, so let's work together to lower the tension and to make a safe environment for everyone. A win-win doesn't begin by deliberately disadvantaging one group of people. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/17/133924.html#a135253" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135313"></a>So here's some free mentoring. The Golden Rule is a good place to start. You catch more flies with honey, is another good one. And a new one that might not have occurred to you -- men are people too, and we're not all that different from you.  Treat us like people you care about and you might be surprised at the result. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/17/133924.html#a135313" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
