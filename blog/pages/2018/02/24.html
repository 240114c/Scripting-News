I'm working on a <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">FAQ page</a>, focusing on the reasons what they're doing is bad that have nothing to do with my specific situation. It's very much a work in progress.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/24.html#a162950" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a173844"></a>BTW, we've been here before with Google, when they <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/06/27/thePressureOnBlogging.html">didn't fully support RSS</a> in Reader. Dominant product, removes features from important public format. I hope people notice this time, it's much bigger, removing HTTP from the web, maybe people won't. I'm okay with them knocking my sites off the web. It'll happen sooner or later anyway.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/24.html#a173844" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Of course I put it <a href="http://this.how/davewiner/">on the web</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/24.html#a160807" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
