<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a170837"></a>Drag and drop doesn't need a target. If you want an app to handle drag and drop, if it can do things other than edit files, just be willing to accept a drop anywhere in the window. When the user lets up, confirm that's what they intended to do. Prior art is Google's <a href="https://images.google.com/">image search</a> page.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28.html#a170837" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And won't sell guns to people under 21. This is a huge deal. We need more like this. But -- trying to get <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/online/roku-keeps-nratv-despite-pressure-to-drop-channel-we-dont-censor-based-on-viewpoint/">Roku</a> to drop NRA TV, that's not only not useful, it's very very very bad. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">First Amendment</a> is super important, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">The Golden Rule</a>. Speech is a good thing, even if you detest what they're saying. And discounts to NRA members? Please that's harmless. NRA members are not the problem. Go to the source. Picket gun stores until they follow DSG's lead. <i>That</i> will save lives. Measure success for now as stopping sales of new weapons of war. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28.html#a142932" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142604"></a>Google is famous for its AI and machine learning. With that in mind, how much trouble would it be for Google to determine that <a href="http://littlecardeditor.com/">Little Card Editor</a> never asks for a credit card number, and they can stop lying to users saying that it might.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28.html#a142604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145529"></a>Bottom line, things that are free are not safe. You have to use your mind at all times when using the web (or Gmail for that matter). Google can if they want make a browser that's like Disneyland. But to try to turn the open web into Disneyland, that's a travesty.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28.html#a145529" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-subs="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]"><a name="a164254"></a>An email from friend <a href="http://www.wirfs-brock.com/allen/">Allen Wirfs-Brock</a>, one of the most interesting emails I've ever received. Seriously. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28/164705.html#a164254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a164317"></a>Dave, I saw your tweet about building a browser by using <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> hosting Chromium.  You know, that is exactly how Brendan Eich’s <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> browser is implemented.  I highly recommend it as an alternative to Chrome.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28/164705.html#a164317" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Brave very much thinks of itself as an “user agent” and that the user is the ultimate authority on what the browser does.  For example, all of their ad blocking and tracking protection (they call these shields)  mechanisms are  easily user enabled or disabled globally or  on a per site basis.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28/164705.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a164428"></a>I suspect it wouldn’t be hard to define “shields” that instead of simply marking http sites as “insecure”did an alert on first user input to http sites or have other various levels of protection. It’s the sort of user control that I think they would be on-board with once they fully understood the user perspective.  (On the other hand they are immersed  in the Bay Area's HTTPS-should-be-used-everywhere culture so they might not immediately get it.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28/164705.html#a164428" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a165441"></a>In either case, their most likely immediate response would be “it's open source, do the work and submit a pull request”.  That is easier said then done, but you might want to take a look at what it would actually take.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28/164705.html#a165441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a164525"></a>It's exciting to know that it's possible to build a useful browser with Electron. Thanks Allen! DW<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/28/164705.html#a164525" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
