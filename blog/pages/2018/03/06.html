It'll be posted in the early evening. There is definitely a position here. I'll be listening for sure. Here's the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechmemeRideHome">feed url</a>.

Why is it a juggernaut? You don't have to get permission to start a podcast, you can follow an idea intuitively, creatively. I offer two examples, the <a href="http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/">Internet History Podcast</a> and <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/heresthething">Here's the Thing</a>. Two podcasts that are not like what you hear in the excellent field of podcasts that sprang from <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a>. And that's just a tiny corner of what's out there. It's huge and diverse. No one gets the whole thing. Podcasting will continue to evolve as long as it's not controlled. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/06.html#a160543" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Podcasting is for everyone, and that includes professionals. I do a podcast every once in a while myself. It doesn't set the world on fire, but the <i>idea</i> of podcasting did. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">medium</a> is the message. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/06.html#a145552" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
