<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a172253"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhad_Manjoo">Farhad Manjoo</a>, tech columnist for the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html">wrote</a> about a hiatus he took from social media and how much he liked it. According to CJR, he actually <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/farhad-manjoo-nyt-unplug.php">didn't</a> take a hiatus. Makes sense. How could a reporter not use Twitter these days? That's where news is made. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/10.html#a172253" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Why? Because ISPs invisibly redirect download requests of popular programs to new versions with spyware added. Better: don't download an app that runs on your local computer from a site that isn't being served via HTTPS. But it doesn't follow that <i>sites that don't offer downloads</i> should be blocked. It's like saying drunk driving is dangerous and therefore all driving should be banned. Let's not break the web if we don't have to. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/10.html#a153516" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
