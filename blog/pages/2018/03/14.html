	<li><a name="a144658"></a>I wrote a simple Node app that reads the file using the standard request package, and what he reports is observed. The umlauts appear as ï¿½ characters. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/14/144612.html#a144658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140232"></a>I have an eye infection. This is a new thing for me since I started wearing contact lenses last year. This means I have to try to get along wearing glasses for a few days. My eyesight with glasses is terrible. Writing is kind of an adventure! So it may be slow going here for me, for the next few days until (hopefully) the infection clears up and I can resume life as a normally sighted person. I am of course getting help from my doctor. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/14/140221.html#a140232" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
