<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160827"></a>My brain is somewhat adjusting to the new vision situation. I have five old pairs of glasses to try out and think I have settled on one tha's best for computer work. I did a podcast (below) because that doesn't use my eyes for much. My brain really wants to do something creative.

Doc, one of the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain</a> authors, has a vision for advertising that works. If it works, it will not only revolutionize advertising, it will also help get software development back on track. His project really has the potential. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/16.html#a151943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
