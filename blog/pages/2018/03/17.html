I don't think they'll have much support. Even his base will be split. Obviously there's something explosive about to come out. But this isn't Watergate. It's more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica">BattleStar Galactica</a>. It's a war and we're fighting an inhuman enemy, one that doesn't behave like a human. It's an amalgam of all of humanity.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/17/194211.html#a193517" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a194842"></a>Trump being gone won't help us very much because so much has changed. A silent war has been going on. We have not had any defenses. It's an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/?mbid=social_fb">asymmetric war</a>, unlike any we've ever (not) fought. The press is oblivious, still, focused on the Watergate-ness of the situation and missing that now our society and economy are fully wired, to an extent not even foreshadowed in the <a href="https://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2013/05/17/40-years-ago-tvs-tuned-watergate-hearings">time</a> of Watergate. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/17/194211.html#a194842" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a200100"></a>The press ought to listen to techies. We're still seen as low-level workers. But our counterparts in Russia and elsewhere are undermining everything. Here too probably. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/17/194211.html#a200100" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a194444"></a>Nailing Trump won't fix it. It would be like killing a comedian, a distraction. The real action has been on our networks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/17/194211.html#a194444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a194512"></a>Remember what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">McLuhan</a> said. It's not about armies anymore, it's about media. And <i>we,</i> all of us, are media now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/17/194211.html#a194512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a194556"></a>Imagine journalism as a rectangular box. They've tried to move what they do from print to the net without changing the shape of the box. In their world this all as a replay of Watergate. It's familiar, they know what to do, and btw it had a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/080974-3.htm">happy ending</a>. That's what we call wishful thinking. A bit of a bedtime story.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/17/194211.html#a194556" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
