<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a181058"></a>Since people are talking about regulating Facebook, how about requiring them to support the basic features of the web in their posts. So you can add links to what you write there. I don't do much writing on Facebook because they're basically killing what I love most about the web. I can't support that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/21.html#a181058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And remembering them. If you're not into the whole surveillance thing, unplug it, and put it away somewhere safe. I wouldn't just throw it out, I'm pretty sure it retains its ability to phone home on your behalf.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a175502"></a>BTW, it's not a good idea to have big tech companies control the cash flowing into news orgs, because more and more news is going to have to look at them unfavorably.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141321"></a>Pro tip. If you want to know what I think about something, search my blog. If I have an opinion it will be there. For example, what I <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+battlestar+galactica&t=hf&ia=web">think</a> of Battlestar Galactica. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/21.html#a141321" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Lots of people are like that. You say please don't do this. They aren't really listening. So all that registers is the thing that you didn't want them to do, not the fact that you don't want them to do it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/21.html#a135110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I offered an analogy. I've been building and living in a house for 24 years. Some of the annexes are falling apart. Others have skeletal remains, and others have become porn sites because I forgot to go to City Hall and re-register the deed for that part of the property (a rule with no exceptions). Honestly, it's a mess. But the core house is fine. Lots of parties and dinners happen there, and we have great photos of them all lining the corridors. It's a huge house for one person, but I call it home. I like it. Then Google comes into the house, uninvited, and says that electricity is too dangerous. We're going to run on new kind of power in our world. I honestly never think about the electricity. What? They say you may not remember where all the wires are buried, but you must dig them up and replace them and rebuild your whole house from the ground up with the new system. Since this neighborhood doesn't support the new kind of power, Google continues, you'll have to move the whole thing, too. Hope you don't mind. Hold on a minute. Here's the thing -- I don't <i>have</i> to do what they say. I can go on living in the house and have parties just like before and stick with the original way of powering the place. Right where it is. No need to change neighborhoods. It's just that people who use the new Google-powered system will get a big warning when they come to visit. "This place is awful," the warning will say. "It has terrorists. If you go inside they'll probably kill you." To which I say, whatever. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/21.html#a132048" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was reminded of a story I told once about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hewitt">Don Hewitt</a>, the creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes">60 Minutes</a>. It was in a <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/07/17/howGoodIsMyMind.html#comment-1496974270">comment</a>, I need to get it on my blog and in my archive, so here it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/21/165159.html#a165318" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a165500"></a>I remember seeing an interview with 60 Minutes producer Don Hewitt, as it turns out a few weeks before he died. He said in the interview that he just couldn't keep up with the technology anymore. And you could tell he meant it. This is a guy who had been at the leading edge of media technology for most of his life, was one of the major innovators. There does come a time, it seems, when you just can't deal with it any more. Your mind gives up.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/21/165159.html#a165500" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a165628"></a>I saw it in my own father, shortly before he died. I was trying to show him how Twitter worked. He wasn't getting it. This is a guy who prided himself on understanding computers, in every way possible, his whole adult life. He told me he would be pushing up daisies soon, and there was no point. His words. He had given up. And he was within his rights to do that. I didn't argue.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/21/165159.html#a165628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
