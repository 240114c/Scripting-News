They interviewed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Zuck</a>. And they have no idea of the context that Facebook exists in, as far as they knew they FB has no competition (there is Google of course), there is no open web, and it probably never crossed their mind that <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22lock-in%22&t=hy&ia=web">lock-in</a> might be a problem. It's <i>always</i> the problem in tech. Poor Zuck, never thought he would have to deal with these problems. They actually have sympathy for him! It's still the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&source=hp&ei=zhy0WrqnJama_Qbr8oTwCg&q=baby+squirrels&oq=baby+squirrels&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1j0l9.1639.4841.0.5001.16.12.0.3.3.0.97.848.11.12.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.15.944.6..46j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i46k1j0i20i263k1.86.NS3xzrSRuCk">baby squirrels</a> thing. There's an easy way out Mark. Set everyone free. Let people use Facebook not because it's the only choice, but rather because it's the best. Eventually his monopoly will break, and it will be a shock to him and the economy. We might come to think of Facebook as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail">too big to fail</a>. Which btw, might have been a fair question to ask him too. I love the Daily, but this is the problem, when they finally get to a subject you know well, we find out what we always find out. They aren't doing a good job of representing the rest of us. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/22.html#a210415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They will be listened to and assumed by default to know what they're talking about. On the other hand, users must take responsibility for their presence on the net, and beware of the costs and tradeoffs of using different services. All we have to do is clearly offer the information they need. If they don't listen, that's on them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/22.html#a165046" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Its closed nature (no linking) is forcing Google to try to hijack what remains of the web to try to compete, to co-exist. They should both disarm, and stop fighting for control and just provide compatible services and let the open web be.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/22.html#a140738" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a162253"></a>This would would make it possible for anyone to compete with Facebook, which would keep Facebook (and their competitors) from grabbing too much power. It's Facebook's lock-in that makes the problems inexorable.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/22/162211.html#a162253" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

It's probably a fix they could implement in 24 hours.
