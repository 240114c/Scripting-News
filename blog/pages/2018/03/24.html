Yes, it is. I know it is because Zillow does it. I have a bunch of queries about real estate in various markets I'm interested in. They send a bulletin every morning of property for sale in each market. The same idea could apply to almost everything I shop for. <i>Instead of guessing, let me tell you what I want. In return you don't spy on me. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/24.html#a143234" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a132808"></a>An example of a cause that is magnificently focused is #blacklivesmatter. It's in their hashtag. They don't care about teaching whites a lesson, or teaching whites what it feels like to be black, or to popularize the concept of white toxicity, or whitesplaining, what they care about is simply -- black lives. Anyone of any race with an ounce of empathy can get behind that. #blacklivesmatter is ready to accept help from anyone. And why not? If you're focused on a goal, in this case, saving black lives, why would you turn away someone who might be able to help?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/24/131937.html#a132808" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132427"></a>For #2, the kids have it exactly right. Vote. It's always been the paradox of gun rights vs gun control in the US, that a small minority controls the majority because they vote. I said this over and over during the Occupy movement. If the result of Occupy is a "message gets out there" you will have accomplished nothing. But if we vote our cause, then we will achieve a lot. Everything. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/24/131937.html#a132427" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132603"></a>The kids are right. If, when they turn 18, and many of them will before the next election, they vote, this will make change. All the voter suppression that the Repubs can muster can't snuff out a movement of this magnitude. We will win. And we will also have a template for winning that can apply to other acts of government.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/24/131937.html#a132603" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a144357"></a>Since my mother's recent <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/11/152545.html">death</a>, I've received many notes of condolence. All very very much appreciated. We all have to send messages of sympathy from time to time. I often find it awkward. Do I say I know what they're going through? In some sense I think I do, but I'm sure I don't, and would it be comforting? I don't think so.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/24/144246.html#a144357" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144546"></a>When people say "It's tough," or talk about what you're "going through" that makes me want to object. I don't think it's tough, that's not the word I'd use. There are silver linings. New freedom. And expressing sadness is just sad, it's not tough. It's the easiest thing in the world. And is "going through" the right term? That assumes there's an end. There isn't always an end. And at the outset it doesn't at all feel like there is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/24/144246.html#a144546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
