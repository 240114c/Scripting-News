<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a230834"></a>In July 1979, I left a backup of my software project, a very early version of ThinkTank, at my parents' house in Queens. My brother <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/03/26/backupFrom1979.png">just found it</a>. 8-inch floppies, formatted in UCSD-Pascal on top of CP-M. How the hell we're going to read the disks is a good question, but this is lost software. I definitely want to read it. Who knows it might even run. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/26.html#a230834" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a133914"></a>Our number one biggest problem is that we divide ourselves into groups. These people are good and those are bad. Everyone does it. It's stupid. It's the bug. Stop it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/26.html#a133914" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I want to separate the management of my RSS subscription list from feed readers. That way I can tell two different apps about my subscription list and they can do different things with it. Or ten different apps. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/26/145515.html#a145522" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145736"></a>It's a version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls">Doc's</a> vision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">VRM</a>. In the Facebook world it would be like telling them who my friends are. I can give access to the same information to any other app that might be competing with Facebook. I think this is a healthier situation. Tech companies are put in their proper place. Providing us with services, as opposed to defining who we are. We get to do that for ourselves, which was always the idea of the open web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/26/145515.html#a145736" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145933"></a>This was part of the original vision of <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>. That subscription could be simple, one-button-click, and not just exportable, but dynamic. A huge difference in possibilities.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/26/145515.html#a145933" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145846"></a>So the first step is to fill the database with feeds, and give people a way to subscribe and unsubscribe. To accept OPML files as input too. And to publish a list of subscriptions that is dynamic, that other apps will in turn subscribe to. I'm working with the developers of two new RSS reader apps that will hook into this feed database. And my own <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> already does, it was built that way from the start, to accept externally defined subscription lists.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/26/145515.html#a145846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150007"></a>I'm debugging and documenting now. Should have a pointer to the app soon. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/26/145515.html#a150007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
