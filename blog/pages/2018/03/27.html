<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a201110"></a>An idea for a social network. When a family member dies, everyone remaining who was related to that person gathers, virtually and physically, and spends weeks telling stories about that person and other departed family members. The process could go on for generations.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/27.html#a201110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a164839"></a>The new app both consumes and generates OPML files. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/27/164606.html#a164839" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a164851"></a>You upload your OPML files, exported from various feed readers you use. All the feeds are added to a database, tagged with your name. Then we produce a new OPML file of all the feeds you've subscribed to. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/27/164606.html#a164851" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a164952"></a>There are other ways of adding and removing feeds, but this is the basic input out. You give us OPML files, we give you back a single OPML file.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/27/164606.html#a164952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a165016"></a><i>It's a bootstrap. </i>This is where the leap of faith comes in. The new OPML file is fairly useless until feed reader apps add the ability to subscribe to an OPML file. Right now very few have this feature. But if even just a few of them do support the feature, all of a sudden we have a bootstrap. And a new way to share flows of news on the web. This was always part of the vision of RSS. Let's see if we can make this happen now in 2018. In a very real sense, we all can be part of history, if it works. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/27/164606.html#a165016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
