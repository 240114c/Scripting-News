<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182519"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/72">Brain trust query</a>: I'm trying to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv">iconv</a> package in Node to translate from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8. I have a very small <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/f68093b4da471028a821c3da467c62af">test program</a> that fails. Hopefully someone more experienced in Node and encodings can help find the problem. Thanks in advance. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/30.html#a182519" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

How long before Russian oligarchs murder a journalist in the US? A member of Congress? A US attorney? How will that chill discourse in politics? And assuming their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVWRetR4jg">puppet</a> stays in office, because what Congress of either party is going to impeach a president if they might get killed for their vote, how long before social networks are as regulated as those in China? This is likely our future. Not sure we can do anything at this time to prevent it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/30.html#a151019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We could mass-migrate to low population Republican-dominated states and change the composition of the Senate and the Electoral College.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/03/30.html#a154351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
