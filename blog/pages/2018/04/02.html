<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a220750"></a>Another feedBase change. When viewing a <a href="http://feedbase.io/?username=davewiner">user's feed list</a>, we sort the feeds alphabetically by title, and don't include the follower count. It makes sense on the hotlist, but not when looking at the feeds an individual user subscribes to.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02.html#a220750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a191743"></a>We now merge duplicate items on the feedBase <a href="http://feedbase.io/">hotlist</a>. So if there are two ways to reference a feed, we add the two counts, and remove one of them. I did it by hand, by looking for duplicates, added code that does the merging. If you spot other duplicates please let me know. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02.html#a191743" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a163659"></a>I need a MySQL mentor or two. While I was working on BingeWorthy and early versions of feedBase, I had two really good mentors, JY Stervinou and Scott Hanson. I don't want to lean just on them, so I'm putting out a call for a few people with MySQL experience so I can ask questions, and get answers based on experience. Saves a lot of time, and it will make feedBase more robust. With that in mind I have a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/73">basic question</a> today, posted here. Thanks in advance! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02.html#a163659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Not very often they respond. I don't mind if they disagree, and push back, but I most definitely do mind if they question the idea of my criticizing their work at all. Last week I had such an encounter, privately. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02/140929.html#a140938" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141213"></a>The criticism of a blogger, a user, someone who isn't trying to maintain access, or please advertisers, is imho more likely to locate a truth about your product, from their point of view, of course.. I never maintain that mine is the only valid point of view, just that it is mine. Take it for what it's worth.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02/140929.html#a141213" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141257"></a>I also have been wrong many times. Famously when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing">desktop publishing</a> was the rage in the mid-80s, I said no one wanted to do it. Hah. It turned out that <i>everyone</i> did, at least at the time.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02/140929.html#a141257" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a141308"></a>I love it when people take the time to respond to what I write, or give me a good bug report on my software. As long as it's thoughtful and makes a point. I even appreciate the effort when they don't. But to outright invalidate the criticism without response? Only <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=scoundrel">scoundrels</a> do that. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02/140929.html#a141308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140024"></a>Today I did a little video demo of Axios and Fast Company, to illustrate.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02/140004.html#a140024" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140042"></a>Axios gets to the point right away, in the first paragraph. And they name names, in a skimmable way. It's designed to be read on the web, <i>quickly.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02/140004.html#a140042" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140903"></a>Other publications, such as Fast Company, have evolved in a different way. Their goal is to keep you reading, by never getting to the point. I almost always give up before figuring out what it was. Which has trained me not to click on FC links.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/02/140004.html#a140903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
