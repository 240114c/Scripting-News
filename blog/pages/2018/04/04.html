<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182147"></a>I gravitate to writers who are in my experience always right. But when they are wrong, and eventually they are, it's spectacular how wrong they are. Not naming names, of course. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/04.html#a182147" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true" data-subs="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]"><a name="a140350"></a>I read about the woman who shot up YouTube yesterday, and found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/youtube-shooting-nasim-najafi-aghdam.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">her story</a> sympathetic. Translated to the terminology of net architecture, she attacked a silo that dominated her online existence, both through YouTube and through Google's search engine. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/04/140324.html#a140350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140427"></a>I sympathize because Google lowers the rank of <a href="http://scripting.com/">my blog</a> because I use HTTP. As if that had anything to do with the authority of the information posted here (it doesn't). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/04/140324.html#a140427" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140645"></a>And they <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/04/04/notMobileFriendly.png">complain</a> that pages that were posted before there were mobile devices aren't mobile-friendly. How can I tell them how ridiculous that is? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/04/140324.html#a140645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141035"></a>And the ultimate humiliation, calling my sites NOT SECURE and their own sites SECURE. Nice going. Who appointed them arbiter of what is and isn't secure on the web? Where do I go to appeal this ruling? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/04/140324.html#a141035" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140517"></a>I also don't like that they took down her videos after the shooting. In coming days, might they take down posts like this one beause it is critical of Google? Of course they will. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/04/140324.html#a140517" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140533"></a>I am a non-violent person, they have nothing to fear from me on that count, but I think one lesson they could take from this experience is they should exercise as little control as possible over the content they serve, or get out of the content serving business. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/04/140324.html#a140533" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
