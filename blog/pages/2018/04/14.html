With that in mind, I want to congratulate the developers of <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsDelivr</a>. I just <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/14/152222.html">adapted</a> my project to use it as a CDN. The process was hard work, but made much easier by the docs and design of jsDelivr. That part was a breeze. They tell you just what you need to know when you need to know it with no extra fluff. This is really rare. Good work! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/14.html#a155101" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154214"></a>BTW, development on <a href="http://feedbase.io/">feedBase</a> is on pause, but I'm going to swing back around to it. I find it's good that once the initial problems are shaken out of a new product, it's good to step back and let it settle down before the next major construction project. (Update: as soon as I wrote this, I found two glaring problems. I'm going to fix them now, not going to wait for the next round of work.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/14.html#a154214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153007"></a>I wrote an <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/11/140429.html">overview</a> of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, the piece I feel the press hasn't written. In case you haven't seen it. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/14.html#a153007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a191034"></a>I want a future-of-news conference where we plan new open systems for news publishing and reading, without sponsorship of big tech companies such as Facebook or Google. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/14/191013.html#a191034" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a191039"></a>There would be a session at the conference entitled How To Get Facebook and Google to Give Us Money, and it would be off-topic at every other session. That way the sessions wouldn't all be repetitive expressions of powerlessness and we could get some work done.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/14/191013.html#a191039" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a191056"></a>People who were at BloggerCon will recognize this as the How To Make Money With Your Blog session at that conference. We swept up all the powerlessness into one session, and made it off-topic at every other one. It worked.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/14/191013.html#a191056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a191116"></a>Artists when they get together, all they want to talk about is how they need to make money. I've never seen a discussion among creative people that didn't immediately devolve to this. In F-O-N, big tech companies encourage this. They want all the attention focused on them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/14/191013.html#a191116" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
