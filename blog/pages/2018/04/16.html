The Denver news orgs are doing something unusual, crossing the wall between publishing and editorial. And <a href="http://www.berkeleyside.com/">Berkeleyside</a>, a local news org who just did a public <a href="http://invest.berkeleyside.com/">offering</a> of stock, and <i>eliminated</i> the wall between publishing and editorial. Have a listen and think if perhaps this isn't a better way forward for news than paywalls and hedge-fund ownership.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/16.html#a202033" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

People still think in terms of a perfect candidate. Dems don't have any. But that's not a problem because the Repubs don't have any either. Imho what we need is someone who appeals to the massive core of American voters, without betraying us to the super-rich. Never mind who appeals to <i>you</i> -- you're going to vote rationally. Think about the massive number of voters who don't. I don't think they're fascists or KKKs, I think they are emotional and want to feel good. Who can give a rousing even angry speech that gets people to feel good about themselves without tearing other people down (except for Trump of course). That's the one.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154441"></a>Sometimes things have to fall apart before they can start to make sense again. When they write the history of the web, if they get the story right, a big event will be the San Francisco newspaper strike in 1994. A lot of ideas came together there, across a wide divide. It showed us how news and tech are inextricably entwined.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/16.html#a154441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a144401"></a>What's unusual about iconv is that it's written in C, and as part of the npm install process it needs to compile it to machine code. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/16/143346.html#a144401" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
