If you make a reader, would you support this? Not sure who would be good to write it, but we'd need someone who loves RSS, and isn't in business.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/18.html#a214730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134216"></a>When I was growing up <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7552947,-73.8758418,3a,75y,67.55h,88.27t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7JDIf4Nq9rc0G2SHUe2f8w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">in NYC</a>, before the EPA, they'd burn garbage in incinerators, in the morning, as I walked to school. It was choking. My mom sent me out clean, by the time I got to school there'd be burnt garbage in my hair and on my clothes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/18.html#a134216" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a164634"></a>My goal was to create an <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/beginning/whatFrontierIs.html">environment</a> I would work in for the rest of my career. I just realized it's exactly <i>30 years later, </i>and I'm still using it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/18/164609.html#a164634" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a165254"></a><b>30 fucking years</b>. I think I earned the right to say it that way. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/18/164609.html#a165254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a164657"></a>Now that I also work in JavaScript, it amazes me how easy the simple things are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software">Frontier</a>, compared to JS, esp when you have to tack on a database. You really have to work at seeing what's going on. In Frontier, you just click around expanding things. You can even look at the runtime stack that way.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/18/164609.html#a164657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a164713"></a>We hacked and optimized and reworked things. In comparison, JS was developed in a more chaotic way. Too many ways to do the same thing imho. In Frontier there tended to be one, which is my preference. However there are missing features. Maybe at some point I'll try to rebuild Frontier in JavaScript. I think I'm now good enough to do it. The original was written in straight C.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/18/164609.html#a164713" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

But you probably do know about things that were developed in Frontier. Like the first blogs, podcasts, RSS feeds, readers and content creation tools, XML-RPC and lots of other good shit. People would ask me how I got so much done. "Great tools." That's Frontier.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/18/164609.html#a164935" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
