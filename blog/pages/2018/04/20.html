Paris has the Eiffel Tower. NYC has the Empire State Building, London has Big Ben. I remember arriving in Silicon Valley in 1979 and driving around looking for it and finding nothing but suburbs. I guess that's why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck%27s_of_Woodside">Buck's</a> was so popular. It certainly wasn't the food. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/20.html#a155015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154352"></a>On a discussion board, I posted, in response to a fellow techie talking about interfaces that work for grandmas. "Here we are, a bunch of middle-aged men, with no clue wtf is going on. On the other hand things are so broken this way, there's no chance of it getting fixed. I don't like the NYC subways either, but they're what we got. Technology is like evolution, it favors what works, and never fixes its mistakes."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/20.html#a154352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
