<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a130337"></a>I finished all sixteen episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_Berlin">Bablylon Berlin</a>. It was quite a ride. And at the end I'm not sure exactly what happened. I needed this <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/babylon-berlin-netflix-how-it-ends.html">summary</a> to convince me that I did/do. Would I recommend it? It's a roller coaster. Dark. Some scenes are hard to watch. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30PPdLTLlko">song</a> is addictive. You fall in love with the characters.  Would I watch it again? Not sure. But the ending isn't exactly Singin' in the Rain. ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/22.html#a130337" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
