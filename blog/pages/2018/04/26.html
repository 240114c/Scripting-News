<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a191944"></a>BTW, since Frontier is the topic <i>du jour, </i>if I could wish for one new feature, a big one, I'd like to have JavaScript integrated as a fully co-equal language to UserTalk. I'd like it to be a special version of JavaScript, that has synchronous versions of code that does various net-related things, most important, a verb that makes an HTTP call and returns what's at the specified address. Without that it isn't much of a scripting language. I'd start with the codebase that Ted has been working on (see Frontier love, below).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/26.html#a191944" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The way itâ€™s framed now, weâ€™re giving control to Google, Facebook, Apple over ISPs. I donâ€™t see any reason users should take a side in that fight since theyâ€™re all fighting over who gets to screw us. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜²</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/26.html#a185908" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a151846"></a>Hearing from lots of <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/beginning/whatFrontierIs.html">Frontier</a> users after Gruber's <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/04/25/30-years-of-frontier">writeup</a> yesterday. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html#a151846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152231"></a>I didn't know that he had used Frontier. It was really interesting to read his perspective. The connection between the language and the object database is something so simple it can be hard to explain. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html#a152231" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152117"></a>Some people wish it would "come back." For them I have good news. Thanks to solid engineering and generous work from Ted C Howard, Frontier runs on today's Macs, except now it's called The OPML Editor, because it's configured as an outliner. Long story. It's totally Frontier.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html#a152117" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a151914"></a>I'm using v10.1b19 as my IDE for my JavaScript work. I've built a real sweet code deployment environment, it's as if S3 is my file system. All this to say that Frontier is as rock-solid as ever. If you're a Mac user and want a Frontier experience, it's available to you. Not as a memory.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html#a151914" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
