<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a202113"></a>Heading to Seattle next week. Just to hang out. I hear the weather is spectacular. And prices for Airbnb's are rock bottom. It's a good time to head west for a few days with friends. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/28.html#a202113" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a201949"></a>If I were going to try to launch a possible Facebook competitor, I would start with the core user experience of FB. No mystery what that is. Itâ€™s a browser-based discussion board. Designed a good ten years ago. So we know how to do better. BTW, I got a really good start on such a piece of software. Spent a full year working on it. Still works great. JS front-end, Node back-end.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/28.html#a201949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a175402"></a>I think if Reid were honest she'd say -- yes it was jarring for me to see a man kissing a man. And go from there to a broader message of healing. It's hypocritical of us to put down other people for feeling this way. Maybe we can listen better, and accept that other people find jarring what we find normal and remember when it felt jarring for us, and not hold it against them, as we wouldn't want it to be held against us. Had Joy Reid said that, I would be cheering her. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/28/175053.html#a175402" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a175238"></a>Truth is it <i>is</i> still somewhat jarring to see two men walking in the park holding hands. But <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=jarring">jarring</a> is ok. In fact jarring is good. It means a limit you have, something that's holding you back, is breaking. Eventually jarring turns into unusual, which becomes nothing, just part of life in the big city.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/28/175053.html#a175238" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a194144"></a>I took a walk in the middle of writing this piece, and noticed a male couple in front of me, holding hands. Normally I wouldn't have noticed it, but now it's on my mind.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/28/175053.html#a194144" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a175332"></a>Get this -- 20 years ago it felt weird to me to hug another man. I got over it. But sometimes it still feels weird. It still feels more natural for me to hug a woman. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/28/175053.html#a175332" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a194438"></a>One more thing: Had she been a man, or not a journalist, I doubt if journalists and politicians would have been as accepting of her non-apology <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/joy-reid-apologizes-for-homophobic-posts-she-doesnt-remember-writing">apology</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/28/175053.html#a194438" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
