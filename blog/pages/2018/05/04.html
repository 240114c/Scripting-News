Let's push the president's BS off the air by good, fun and truthful counter-programming.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/04.html#a164826" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a064319"></a>I'm watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBLS_OM6Puk">Wild Wild Country</a> on Netflix. I'm through the first two episodes. I knew a few people who were at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneeshpuram">Rajneeshpuram</a> in my massage school days. I wish I had asked them more about what it was like there. It's a really good story so far.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/04.html#a064319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There is a philosophy to quilting, which I observe as an outsider. The work is done very much with the idea of creating a legacy. I have a friend, Sheila, in Seattle who is a quilter. I wanted her to have one of Eve's quilts, even though they had never met. I thought of this because she posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10216286318295172&set=a.1604799764457.241313.1370027423&type=3&theater">picture</a> of her latest quilt on Faceboo. We hooked up in Seattle this week, talked about parents, and of course quilting. I don't know much about quilting, but I find it fascinating. Anyway, I just rolled over the archive for this blog, saving an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2018/04.opml">OPML file</a> of the writing I did in April, along with all the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml">other months</a>. In a way my blog archive is like mom's quilt collection. A hope to pass something into the future saying <i>this is who I was.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/04.html#a065234" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a070909"></a>In hindsight, I realize we should have done a video walkthrough of mom's house as it was when she left us. Exactly as it was. Now it is staged for sale, all the personal stuff is out. It's a house transitioning to be a new family's house. It was <i>our</i> family house for over 50 years. I didn't think of it because at the time, the way the house was set up was <i>the most normal thing. </i>I never thought that it was an archive of lives that were now over, that it was about to disappear. I mention this so if you end up being the one to close up shop on a family house, take a good video snapshot before you start taking it apart. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/04.html#a070909" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
