By putting human voting American bodies in their way everywhere they go, all the time 24 by 7.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/05.html#a002921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There's only one rule that I know of, babies - God damn it, you've got to be kind.” <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/05.html#a164657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a152309"></a>It's like everything in the rise of Trump, we tend to wake up to what we could have done when it's too late. This happens over and over. When we finally react in a timely fashion it will seem radical. It will <i>be</i> radical, and it will have a chance of working.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/05/152049.html#a152309" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152441"></a>Stop interviewing elites. They're as bad as journalists at wanting to pretend everything is okay. You all climbed the ladder. Say the ladder is gone, and they'll argue with you. "You're being too dramatic," but no in fact it's not too dramatic. Ladders are gone. The elites went to the ovens along with the Jews and the gypsies. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/05/152049.html#a152441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
