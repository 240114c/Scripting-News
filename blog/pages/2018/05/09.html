<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a202911"></a>Journalism has to consider, at some point soon, the possibility that assuming Trump is not compromised is making their reporting wildly inaccurate.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/09.html#a202911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a201303"></a>I listened to <a href="http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/05/09/206968.html">today's Daily</a> podcast on Trump pulling out of the Iran deal. I guess because they can't prove that Trump is owned by Russia they can't consider that his actions have to be viewed in those terms. If they could, then the explanation is clear. Trump is trying to dismantle American influence in the Middle East and create a vacuum for Russia to move into. This is the Occam's Razor answer.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/09.html#a201303" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There really is nothing good you can do with the billions. You still are a person, you still are the person you were before you had the billions. There's no escaping yourself, I know I've tried, it doesn't work. There is no <i>better</i> when it comes to people. We're all slightly different variants of the same theme. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/09.html#a160612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153759"></a>The NYT Daily podcast is spawning a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/business/media/new-york-times-daily-podcast-tv.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">weekly show</a> on FX. It will not be hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/mikiebarb">Michael Barbaro.</a> I think this is a mistake. The thing that makes the Daily good is not that they're NYT reporters, though that is of course important, it's that Barbaro is an inquisitive and empathetic interviewer. There are lots of NYT reporters, but I've never seen an interviewer so capable of bringing out an unusual point of view as Barbaro. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/09.html#a153759" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Because they are two distinct viewpoints. The former says "I could be wrong" and the latter doesn't admit that. I am solidly in the first camp.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/09.html#a153400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
