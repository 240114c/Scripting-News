<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144330"></a>I don't know why I waited so long to find the <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/09/24.html#When:1:51:29PM">day</a> that I first used the term <i>podcast</i> to describe <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/whatIsPodcasting">what</a> we were doing with audio and RSS. That was one of the reasons I kept a blog (still is) -- to have a chronological record of how ideas develop. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10.html#a144330" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a202455"></a>Doc Searls an old radio guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041001072412/http://garage.docsearls.com/node/view/462">wrote about podcasting</a> in the same month of September 2004. He followed this with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041105123652/http://garage.docsearls.com/node/view/469">another piece</a> in October, explaining that podcasting is not radio. October was an <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/10.html">incredible month</a>, lots of adoption, new aggregators, tools, an audio version of weblogs.com, and signs of the grief that was about to happen, starting to happen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10.html#a202455" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-subs="[object Object],[object Object]"><a name="a204414"></a>I got the response from Lexis/Nexis re the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/77">mapping</a> of radio.weblogs.com, doc.weblogs.com and scoble.weblogs.com. Here's what they <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/05/10/lexisNexisWeblogsCom.png">said</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/204408.html#a204414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a204809"></a>"During a recent security audit related to the GDPR, we removed the DNS entries for doc.weblogs.com, radio.weblogs.com , and scoble.weblogs.com . We had concerns about cross-domain issues such as cookie sharing, along with general concerns about having subdomains that were not under our control. At this point, the only suggestion we can make is for you to update the links on scripting.com  to point to the newer domain names that are under your control."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/204408.html#a204809" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a204508"></a>Of course it's not just links from scripting.com that are broken. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand">Radio UserLand</a> was a large early blogging community. Links into the archive of these weblogs are also broken.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/204408.html#a204508" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a205417"></a>And you can access Scoble's Radio blog at <a href="http://scoble.scripting.com/">scoble.scripting.com</a>. That's a completely new name, there are no links to it anywhere on the net (except here of course).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/204408.html#a205417" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a133519"></a>Click a link in a web browser, it should open a web page, not try to open an app which you may not have installed.

	<li><a name="a133600"></a>Facebook is taking the place of blogs, but doesn't permit linking, styles. Posts can't have titles or include podcasts. As a result these essential features are falling into disuse. We're returning to AOL. Linking, especially is essential.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a133600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133654"></a>Google is forcing websites to change to support HTTPS. Sounds innocuous until you realize how many millions of historic domains won't make the switch. It's as if a library decided to burn all books written before 2000, say. The web has been used as an archival medium, it isn't up to a company to decide to change that, after the fact. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a133654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133918"></a>Medium, a blogging site, is gradually closing itself off to the world. People used it for years as the place-of-record. I objected when I saw them do this, because it was easy to foresee Medium pivoting, and they <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/05/medium-abruptly-cancels-the-membership-programs-of-its-21-remaining-publisher-partners/">will</a> <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/#a180510p16">pivot again</a>. The final pivot will be when they go off the air entirely, as commercial blogging systems eventually do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a133918" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a134036"></a>We should preserve the past on the web, and learn to make sites even more future-safe. The web is where human knowlege accumulates. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a134036" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134512"></a>It's time for tech people to have values, as journalism, medicine and law do. Deliberately taking features out of the web, claiming pieces of the web as corporate property, forcing the history offline, all are terrible abuses of what make the Internet great. An ethical technologist would refuse to do this work.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a134512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a134344"></a>The Internet is a place for the people, like parks, libraries, museums, historic places.
