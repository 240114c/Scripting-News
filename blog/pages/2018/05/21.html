We don't have to be riveted on the stream of minutiae coming out of journalism. Instead we have to organize and get the focus where it belongs, on the people. We're considered spectators, part of a wave that might or might not exist. The only way out of this for the people to organize. And that means <i>doing things, </i>not just watching.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/21.html#a162644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a132139"></a>I have an <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> app that's developing into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software">Frontier</a>-like thing, but there are still many things Frontier does better or easier. Then I had a flash, why not call Frontier from the Electron app. How? Using <a href="http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/">XML-RPC</a> of course. So I wrote an XML-RPC client in JavaScript. Doesn't yet support all the types. It works! I was able to call <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cZ7RAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=examples.getStateName&source=bl&ots=0d1hw6T5tq&sig=UxqJEDleugSOvKoSIfKLxjH3QC8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjCm_Xv85bbAhVyuVkKHZGYD70Q6AEwB3oECAEQTg#v=onepage&q=examples.getStateName&f=false">examples.getStateName (23)</a> and sure enough it returns Minnesota. This might be very interesting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/21.html#a132139" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a133927"></a>Last month, XML-RPC was 20 years old. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/04/fourYearsOfXmlrpc.html">piece</a> written on its fourth anniversary in 2002.

My mom had a picture of me from the 1980s on the fireplace mantle. It's a publicity shot from Living Videotext that appeared in a fair number of press stories about our company. A good picture, but it had a lot of exposure to the sun over the years. That's what the white spots are from. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/21.html#a151252" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
