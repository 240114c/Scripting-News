For a few years Medium became the place that people would post essays that were meant to be on the public record. This was not a good idea, because Medium is a venture-backed startup, and was likely to pivot. What's on-the-record today must at least have the stated intention of being accessible tomorrow. That was never true of Medium.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/30.html#a140458" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153807"></a>Now that I have my <a href="https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc">XML-RPC server and client</a> for JavaScript, I've started to look for activity if any, in the RPC world, not just in XML but also JSON. Here's a <a href="https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=334124">survey</a> written by Bruce Eckel in 2011.
