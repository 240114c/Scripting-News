After you win a championship the team is disbanded. Re-shuffe the deck. It's the only way a New York team will ever make the playoffs. Unless they let us trade a whole team for our miserable Knicks or Nets. Obviously any trade would have to include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan">owner</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/04.html#a140545" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Everyone used it. If you used some other git server, you'd have to explain why. Now that consensus will very likely break up. Where will people go? Will a new consensus emerge? Seems unlikely, you pretty much need a vacuum for that to happen, though there have been exceptions.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/04/134647.html#a135307" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135204"></a>Microsoft may have better intentions than they used to, but I'm from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Duncan_Vandiver">Missouri</a>. And oftentimes acquistions are ruined because of incompetence, or key people leaving. They don't have to be <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1003590025462681600">evil</a> for this to go bad.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/04/134647.html#a135204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135420"></a>It'll be interesting to see if any of the mainstream press talks to and understands developers. This acquisition is totally about developers.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/04/134647.html#a135420" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a135438"></a>Microsoft could ease a lot of fears by offering to redirect any project to another git server. If anyone from either company is listening, consider that a suggestion. Otherwise we have a problem with all the github.com URLs out there on the web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/04/134647.html#a135438" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135647"></a>They chose an interesting day to announce, the first day of Apple's WWDC. This of course is not a coincidence. (See note below.

	<li><a name="a135058"></a>I ignored their acquisition of LinkedIn, I have an account there, but I hardly use it. But GitHub is different. I use it as a backup of all my development work. I use it as a platform, and I've written tools that only work with GitHub. It's hard to imagine that I would have done that with Microsoft as the owner.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/04/134647.html#a135058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

One thing -- it actually is not intentional to announce concurrent w/ WWDC. Mergers/Acquisitions get announced when they are signed, not when we want them to.
