Show notes follow. The Battlestar Galactica quote: "All of this has happened before and all of this will happen again." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a> wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a>. Microsoft's first CFO was <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930423&slug=1697384">Frank Gaudette</a>.  Microsoft's 2017 sales <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft/financials">were</a> approx $90 billion. Bottom-line: Advice to MS, add a feature that allows users to redirect from their GitHub repos, and consider a "loyalty dividend" for pre-Microsoft GitHub users, and establish a new tradition in tech acquisitions, a windfall for users. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/05.html#a150306" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153645"></a>The <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/25/133439.html">Node debugger</a> is great. Finally I have a full server-side debugger, and it's making it possible for me to make more complex code. I added a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagepark#v0719-6418-by-dw">feature</a> to PagePark that allows it to serve from an S3 location. Not just delegate to Amazon's server, which it could do before, you get the full PagePark functionality for S3-stored content. It's done through config.json in the domain's folder. I'm going to use it in conjunction with <a href="http://publicfolder.io/">publicfolder</a>, finally, to get the Dropbox delay out of my writing for the this.how site, which I do with a desktop outliner. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/05.html#a153645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153519"></a>Apparently a lot of people don't know there's a <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/mobile-apps">Starbucks app</a>. There is. And it's great. You can order anything, ahead of your arrival, and it's waiting for you when you get there. Totally takes the hassle out of Starbucks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/05.html#a153519" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134817"></a>Idea for a cable news show. Every night they poll a random group of Americans with questions relating to the news of the day. A cross-section, not just liberals or conservatives, all regions, races, etc. They don't know that it's the show polling them. A real polling organization runs it. Pundits discuss what the people think. Last night they would have asked <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1003700531569872897">this question</a>. Do you think the president should be able to pardon him or herself? The choices would be: Yes but only Repubs, Yes but only Dems, Yes, No. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/05.html#a134817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135748"></a>What inspired the idea. In all the talk on MSNBC last night about the president <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/06/04/616724965/giuliani-president-trump-has-constitutional-authority-to-pardon-himself">pardoning himself</a> not once did anyone ask if there was a benefit to American people in the president being able to do so. Seems the journalism, if you can call it that, has lost the tune. The tune is this: A government of the people, by the people and for the people.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134753"></a>Why Trump lied about the Eagles kneeling. He was embarrassed that most of the players didn’t want to hang out with him, so he made up a story to hide that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/05.html#a134753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
