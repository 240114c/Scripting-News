<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a234049"></a>I hit a milestone today. My XML-RPC implementation for JavaScript now also speaks JSON, end-to-end. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/06/milestone.png">screen shot</a> of the updated debugger. A bit of cleanup work remains.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/06.html#a234049" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Not sure this was an overly bright move. One week I'm on the definitive open source site, and the next week it's Microsoft. That's like switching religions. And no one asked me, and I didn't get anything in return. They must think we're completely spineless idiots. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/06.html#a181959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Now you can redirect from the file that's being redirected. An idea stolen from MacHTTP of the 1990s. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/06.html#a165905" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When I see it's on Medium, I skim to see if it's absolutely essential that I read it, if not, I quickly hit the Back button. Come on everyone we can do better than this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/06.html#a154454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144600"></a>Some days you need a stupid warmup project to get your mind going. For me, today, that was <a href="http://slogan.scripting.com/">this ridiculous site</a>, which was a bad idea to begin with, and only got worse as it developed. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/06.html#a144600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
