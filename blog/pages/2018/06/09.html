<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/09/threeStooges.png"><a name="a212404"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/09/threeStooges.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">One of the things I'm learning is that there is are <a href="https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2007/10/02/xmlrpc-php-dates/">problems</a> with date-time values. The question is whether or not the date part of the date-time should have hyphens. The Frontier implementation does not. The <a href="http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html">XML-RPC spec</a> says not. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> seems to say they must be present. The built-in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString">JavaScript function</a> includes the hyphens. I don't have any other implementations that I can easily check against, so I don't know what offers the most interop with other XML-RPCs. For now I'm <a href="https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/3">documenting the issue</a>, and leaving the JavaScript implementation as it is, for now. This means in this area it does not interop with Frontier, in that Frontier will not understand the JavaScript date-time values. Going in the other direction there is no problem, because I've included a workaround. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/09.html#a212404" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155751"></a>Next up: I'm going to write the <a href="http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/validator1Docs.html">validator handlers</a> in JavaScript so I can test my implementation. And perhaps others can test theirs. (It was a good idea. Just found a bug in my implementation. &lt;struct>s can be empty. My server was throwing an error on an empty struct.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/09.html#a155751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
