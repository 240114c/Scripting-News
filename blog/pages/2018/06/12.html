<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a171058"></a>Remember how the Obama campaign in 2008 used meetups to get out the vote. Let's do that again. Put the focus on getting people to register and to vote to be sure Congress represents the people's interest starting early next year, and to get Trump out of the White House asap so we can start rebuilding. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12.html#a171058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Which keeps them from going the next step to see theories that might explain why Trump is the way he is. Why does Trump love Putin, Netanyahu, Kim Jong Un? Why does he hate the G7? His algorithm might be just this simple -- he's the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/12/obamaInverseFullSize.png">inverse image</a> of Obama. Where Obama is light, Trump is dark. And vice versa. He likes what Obama doesn't, and he hates what Obama likes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12.html#a125359" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a133103"></a>How about a Chrome plug-in that redirects from each Google site to a competitive site. So when you go to do a Google search, it takes you to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo.com</a>  for example. Installing it would be like wearing a nicotine patch.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12.html#a133103" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a140336"></a>My fear is this -- once <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+google&t=h_&ia=web">Google</a> has <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">control</a> of the web, they can turn off huge parts of it for whatever reason, however thoughtless, and without disclosing why. They might say they would never do it, but I've seen them do it with <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/about/">Google Reader</a>.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12/140329.html#a140336" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140350"></a>Their intentions might be fine and it might not be on their roadmap, but capturing RSS and then shutting it off probably wasn't on their roadmap either, until they decided to do it. Then it was on their <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">roadmap</a>. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12/140329.html#a140350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140359"></a>They talk to me like I have no idea how tech companies work internally, but I do. After the next reorg they won't remember any commitments the previous management made. It's like when we change administrations in Washington. Very chaotic.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12/140329.html#a140359" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140411"></a>That's why the wonder of the web is that it is not subject to the whims of chaotic corporate management. Now, I suppose at some point it <i>will</i> be owned, and then after that it will be shut down. That's how we lose huge amounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">IP</a>, open stuff, non-corporate stuff.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12/140329.html#a140411" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140420"></a>It's not surprising that a big corporation has little respect for stuff developed outside big corporations, but that was and could continue to be the glory of the web. It was amazing all those years ago, the freedom to do whatever you thought of doing. (It's what made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#History">Google</a> itself possible.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12/140329.html#a140420" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140429"></a>I would like future generations to have that ability too. But next year's roadmap from Google will make the web more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">AOL</a> and the one after that, more and so on.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/12/140329.html#a140429" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
