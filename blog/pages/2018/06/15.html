<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a122419"></a>I'm traveling, so updates have been infrequent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/15.html#a122419" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a122440"></a>I watched the whole of the first season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_(TV_series)">Barry</a>, an HBO series starring Bill Hader. It's billed as a comedy, I guess, but it's not casual. No spoiler to say that Barry is a hitman, you find out in the very first scene. But it is a bit profound, and lots of plot twists, and about as excellent as you would expect given the brilliance of Hader.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/15.html#a122440" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a122644"></a>I also watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Money_in_the_World">All the Money In the World</a>, quite good. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/15.html#a122644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a122709"></a>I'm writing this as a speaker from Amazon, a sponsor of the conference I'm at, is giving a commercial. IBM also did one earlier. Otherwise the conference, <a href="http://sotn.it/">SOTN18</a>, put on by my longtime friend <a href="http://sotn.it/founders/valdemarin/">Paolo Valdemarin</a>, has been excellent. I am being interviewed on-stage by Italian journalist <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Masera">Anna Masera</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/stateofthenet/status/1007597498926497792">9AM</a> Eastern. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/15.html#a122709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
