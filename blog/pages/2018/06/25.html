My problem is that when I buy nice ones I lose them. So I buy shitty sunglasses, in bulk, and let them get lost. But in Italy I couldn't even stand to take them out because everyone had such nice sunglasses. When I got home, I splurged, and bought a new pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015EJWFZE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Raybans</a>. They are <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/25/bigSunglasses.png">beautiful</a>. And they make what I see beautiful too. I will probably lose these too, though I may be developing a system for not losing them. We'll see. In the meantime I am enjoying them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/25.html#a123936" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a120841"></a>Inside the government I bet they're thinking the mistake they made with the zero tolerance border policy is letting the story leak out. This was the conclusion of the Bush II administration re Vietnam, that the mistake was letting pictures of flag-draped coffins get out. So they prevented that in the Iraq War. Also a big tax cut and no draft. That bought peace at home for a war that was just as wrong as Vietnam. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/25.html#a120841" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a190058"></a>Everyone is focused on the optics of what's happening in the immigration system, but underneath the awful images there's a real problem with no easy answers. The problem he's dealing with is far from new, and is horrible, and has been mishandled by every president since Clinton, leading to an escalating problem, and because he is so inept at communicating, Trump has turned into a huge crisis.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/25/190052.html#a190058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a190229"></a>Looked at another way, remember how everyone has been positing what would happen when Trump had to deal with a crisis not of his own making? This is it. But he can't seem to get our sympathy and support, when any other president would have been able to do so easily.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/25/190052.html#a190229" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a190905"></a>Part of what we're seeing here is not only Adolf Hitler 2.0, but also a man who is in totally over his head, unable to understand how the US government functions. He's panicking. And folks, this is only one of a dozen major ongoing crises a president has to deal with. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/25/190052.html#a190905" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a190511"></a>It's a real problem. If only our president had the means to communicate it in a rational, non-hysterical way. This one only knows one way of communicating -- he attacks.
