The <a href="https://twitter.com/_ethiopiangold/status/1010577140595560448">latest</a> calls the cops on an 8-year-old girl selling water in front of her house. Her name is Boo. (Update: She was forced to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/26/permit-patty-san-francisco-police-black-girl-selling-water">resign</a> from the cannabis business she founded.) But the most interesting of all is the original, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Huckabee_Sanders">Sarah Huckabee Sanders</a>. In there beats the heart of a human being, I'm sure, but it's so well hidden by the venemous bile.

	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true"><a name="a114421"></a>One of the things that came up in <a href="http://sotn.it/schedule/">Trieste</a> is the question of the decline of the blogosphere. Here's what I said.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/26/114410.html#a114421" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a114430"></a>I doubt if the blogosphere of 2018 is smaller in absolute terms than the blogosphere of the early 2000s. In fact I'm pretty sure it's orders of magnitude larger, if you consider the size of just two hosting services -- Wordpress.com and Tumblr. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/26/114410.html#a114430" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a114454"></a>Most of the people who use social media, Twitter, Facebook etc are not <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html" title="Natural-born bloggers">NBBs</a>. They were never going to become bloggers. We learned this in the early days of the evangelism of blogs. Most people don't have the impulse.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/26/114410.html#a114454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a114503"></a>What changed is we lost the center. I know something about this because I created and operated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a>. It worked at first, but then the blogosphere <a href="http://oldweblogscomblog.scripting.com/2001/09/27">grew</a> and grew, and weblogs.com didn't or couldn't scale to meet it. Eventually I sold it because it was such a personal burden for me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/26/114410.html#a114503" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a114520"></a>The blogosphere is made of people, but the people treated the center like a corporation, and it wasn't. If we ever want to reboot the center, there has to be a cooperative spirit, and a limit to its scope to avoid the scaling problems. You can't put a big corp at the center of something so independent, or it ceases to be independent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/26/114410.html#a114520" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a114528"></a>We're paying a price now for the lack of a center as <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google</a> and others move to control the open web that made blogging possible. Bloggers need the low barrier to entry to hosting our own blogs, even if we never use it. It's our escape plan. With no way out, the hosting companies will turn into AOL. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/26/114410.html#a114528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134721"></a>There used to be a communication network among bloggers, but that's gone now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/26/114410.html#a134721" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
