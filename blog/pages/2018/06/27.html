Now if the <a href="http://pics.scripting.com/0129/0001.jpg" title="My first flat-screen monitor.">anchor</a> tag linking to the image has a title <a href="http://pics.scripting.com/0050/0006.jpg" title="Dave Jacobs bought a hot new sports car, many years ago.">attribute</a>, that is displayed in the lower left corner of the dialog. At first I thought it should be at the top, but that's not the role that <a href="http://scripting.com/static/412/Dscn1048.jpg" title="Lunch w Tim O'Reilly when he got a call from Jeff Bezos.">titles</a> play in anchors. It's a parenthetical comment. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/27.html#a195229" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a185003"></a>Suppose a major news org were to launch a Twitter-like service. Somehow the reporters would use the platform to create a new kind of news. A tight relationship with the software designers. Journalists excited about changing how reporting works. Sources empowered in new ways.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/27.html#a185003" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But why just the US? Let's shut down the <i>world</i> economy for a few days to register our total rejection of the path the US govt is on.
