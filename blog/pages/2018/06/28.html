Hitler became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power#Chancellor_to_dictator">chancellor</a> of Germany in 1933 at <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/28/hitler.png">44</a>. Trump became president of the United States in 2016 at 70. There are of course other differences. In order to have a global empire Hitler had to go to war, which he ultimately lost. Trump was elected president of a country that already dominated, economically and militarily, and had by far the largest military and nuclear weapons. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/28.html#a130750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125832"></a>I want to fight against the Trump Administration. It sounds like the Democrats are going to lead. Even if they don't, it's time to stop being doormats for the Republicans.

	<li><a name="a181938"></a>This is big news? Seriously? Because any fool watching this who isn't a journalist would get that it's one big fume factory.

	<li><a name="a182034"></a>Of course what's so ironic about this particular story is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursive</a> it is. A journalist noticing that journalists are narcissists is itself of course narcissism. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/28/181840.html#a182034" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
