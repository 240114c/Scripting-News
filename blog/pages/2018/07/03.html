<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/05/16/alHorford.png"><a name="a134228"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/05/16/alHorford.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I love the NBA, and this is by far the best part of the season which is an interesting statement, because the NBA isn't playing basketball right now. They're playing power and money. The money is huge and the power is shifting. The Lakers get LeBron because of Magic, Kobe, Shaq, Kareem, Wilt, Jerry, Phil and Pat et al. And Golden State gets Cousins because  <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2018/7/3/17529428/demarcus-cousins-signs-warriors-nba-free-agency-reactions">they can</a>. So many interesting conversations to be had. I've heard it said that the East is now a backwater, but wait until a western star realizes they can play a completely different game in the East. Free agency isn't over yet for 2018. And I can't wait to see Philadelphia and Boston compete, and somehow hope the Knicks get into it, but so far, not.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/03.html#a134228" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

What you want is the same freedom you get from an email service -- when its time to move, you can forward all requests to the new service. I've posted the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/86">same questions</a> in the issues section of the repo for this blog. Turns out it isn't that simple, and while WordPress <a href="https://twitter.com/pmaiorana/status/1014123762441228288">claims</a> to do it, at least <a href="https://twitter.com/thDigitalReader/status/1014125804148658176">one</a> of their users says they don't. This is worth exploring. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/03.html#a124146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I appreciate the invention of the web. It came at just the right time. I had been knocked out of the software game by Apple. The software I made threatened them, so they launched a competitor. I was looking for a platform without a platform vendor, and had no hope of ever finding one, when just the right thing showed up -- the web. You can see my excitement in the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">early posts</a> to DaveNet, my early weblog and email newsletter, in 1994. But where is Tim now that <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google</a> is attempting to corporatize the web platform? He's still talking about writing software that will fix the problem. At this point software won't do it, imho. Way too late for that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/03/121527.html#a121536" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a121542"></a>We need <i>him, </i>and we need everyone else who profited from the open web. Why am I the only one <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">protesting</a>? Could it be that everyone else hopes to get a job from Google? Or a grant? Aren't you aware of how much we depend on the open ecosystem? And how fragile it is? Could it be they don't remember that Google loses interest in projects that we depend on and dumps them? It's one thing when they created the thing they dump, but quite another when it's something that was once a public resource that they took over. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/03/121527.html#a121542" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a121727"></a>We will be fighting for our freedom for the rest of our lives. But this is an easy battle to win. If enough thought leaders speak out in favor of the open web now, I think Google will back down. Let's get them to the table where we can talk creatively about the problem they see, and find a way to solve it wtihout them taking over the web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/03/121527.html#a121727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
