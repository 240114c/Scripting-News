<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145942"></a>We need a political party that spans international boundaries. I want to read a blog written by a Brit that explains what's going on. Who is their Lindsey Graham? Nancy Pelosi? Al Sharpton? I want to know who I should be reading from Canada, Germany, Japan, Russia, Italy, etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/09.html#a145942" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124849"></a>For years I was really confused about what blogging is, after Twitter and Facebook. In May last year I decided I <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">wanted</a> my old blog back, the one I started in 1997. Now, a year later, I realize it really works. The 280 char limit in Twitter helps because I can cross-post shorter posts there. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/09/blogScreenShot.png">screen shot</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/09.html#a124849" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a123943"></a>Just did a little shopping. Went to Whole Foods to pick up fruit, bread, Italian sparkling water (a habit I developed on my recent trip). I used the newly installed Whole Foods app using my Amazon ID to get a discount. I used Apple Pay to pay for it. On my way out the store I used the Starbuck's app to buy an <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/09/coffeeLabel.png">iced coffee</a> and breakfast sandwich, which was there when I arrived two minutes later. I remarked to the checkout guy at Whole Foods that this is the future. He asked if I was a robot. I thought a bit, smiled, and said yeah almost. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/09.html#a123943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It has one sub, <a href="https://twitter.com/Twittergram/status/1016328530328805377">Far West</a>.
