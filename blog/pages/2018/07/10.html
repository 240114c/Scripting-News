<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145527"></a>The other day I was <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/09/143533.html">looking</a> for the canonical <a href="http://hosting.opml.org/dave/spec/states.opml">states.opml</a> file, the one that I use to test structures of outlines with. I found what appears to be the original copy, dated 12/2/2000. It's now <a href="http://this.how/states/states.opml">accessible</a> through this.how, which is served by PagePark, using its built-in ability to render OPML files. I'm rebooting the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+worldoutline&t=h_&ia=web">worldoutline</a> capabilities but with an open source scalable stack. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/10.html#a145527" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In 2008, Obama had a social network of voters who met, knocked on doors, arranged a buddy system for people to vote. We should reboot that, only do it better. It's 2018, and the technology and our know-how have improved a lot. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/10.html#a135639" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There was an exercise I always try to remember when it's time to listen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/10/133458.html#a133958" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135251"></a>The group separates into pairs. Seated on mats on the floor. Spines straight, head straight, not tilted in or out or to a side. One person speaks and the other listens. The speaker just talks, no rules there. Share whatever you want. Anything. The listener says nothing. Your body doesn't move in or out. No hugging, touching, no words. Your eyes stay neutral. No facial expressions. No empathy, no approval or disapproval, just hear what the other person is saying. Understand that they are this person's words. No response is allowed.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/10/133458.html#a135251" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a134018"></a>What made me think of this today? I listened to the latest <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a> podcast, the <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/617/fermis-paradox/act-two-2">second segment</a> was a couple's therapy session. One was speaking, the other wasn't listening. If you're in a troubled relationship, I highly recommend the podcast. And if you can find someone who will pair with you on the listening exercise, above, I recommend that as well. You may be surprised how hard it is to stay centered, neutral, just listen, not go in or out.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/10/133458.html#a134018" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

People would understand that their friends and partners are real people, not just screens for projecting their movies on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/10/133458.html#a134630" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
