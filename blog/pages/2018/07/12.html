Of course I question that, I did when they were an independent company. Now that GitHub is owned by Microsoft, I still question it. Not sure if it's more or less likely to survive as-is for the indefinite future. Made me wonder what Microsoft could do to reassure developers, so we'd feel comfortable treating it as a permanent resource. Clearly that's in their interest. Microsoft has embraced open source, now I wonder if they have what it takes to be a leader. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/12.html#a163521" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142546"></a>I'm now archiving the RSS file for Scripting News <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/rss.xml">in the GitHub repo</a>, every night, along with the content of the blog for the day (in JSON, OPML and HTML). It'll be interesting to be able to track the changes to the file over (knock wood) long periods of time. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolNightly/blob/master/oldschoolnightly.js">source</a> of the app that does the uploading. It's proven to be very reliable. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/12.html#a142546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He says getting non-voters to vote is where our attention should be. Couldn't agree more. I want a system, where voters have buddies, like sponsors in a 12-step program, who they commit to voting, and they engage on Election Day and make sure they do. They escort them to the poll if necessary. We should have drills. What an incredible demonstration that would be. Far more powerful than a march. Think about it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/12/154940.html#a155022" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a143724"></a>I agree. Race <i>is</i> visible, and the statement that you don't see it is ludicrous. We see it. To say otherwise is to push it aside. I've written about this a few times before, once in an explainer about <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/17/0880.html">Black Lives Matter</a>, and what it means, from a white person's perspective. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/12/143459.html#a143724" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143901"></a>I want to do more. I feel compelled, not just to make life safer and simpler for people of color, but also to put up a roadblock to racism, to let it know that it will encounter resistance. Some things are better kept under cover. Racism for sure is one of them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/12/143459.html#a143901" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

A white person wearing a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/09/mlk.png">MLK button</a> makes a statement of equivalence. Treat me as you would treat a black person. If a majority of whites wore these buttons it would make a promise to our fellow citizens, that if there's trouble, we're standing with you. <i>When</i> there's trouble. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/12/143459.html#a143949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
