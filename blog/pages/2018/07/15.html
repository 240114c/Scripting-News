<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143905"></a>Happy to report that an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/87">SQLite</a> test app took about ten minutes to write and install. They make it sound like installing the native portion is some huge deal. It's not. I would share what I have so far, but I just followed the instructions on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-sqlite3">this page</a>. They work, and the demo app works. I have an interesting project in mind, but first I have to learn more about SQLite to see if it's feasible. Still diggin. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/15.html#a143905" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

This is based on what I learned bootstrapping blogging and podcasting. The same ideas should work for journalism, at least as starting points. We have to <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/30/122337.html">work together</a>, and not wait for the tech industry to do it, imho. We can do it. Programmers can save the world. (Not really exaggerating.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/15.html#a145117" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
