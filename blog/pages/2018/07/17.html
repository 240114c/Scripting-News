His problem isn't a pee tape, it's that Trump's wealth is Russian wealth. That fact is about to come out publicly, and Trump was afraid it would come out at the press conference, with the whole world watching with the cameras on his face. That's what they talked about privately, and that's why Putin had such a big <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+grin+like+a+Cheshire+cat">grin</a>. He has Trump's balls in a jar on his desk back in Moscow. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/17.html#a135225" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125711"></a>How to put this -- it's nice when a journalist or political figure correctly explains out how technology works. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1019082628341948422">Noah Smith</a>, an opinion writer for Bloomberg, advises a <a href="https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo/status/1018944985415249924">columnist</a> for the Washington Post that muting on Twitter is not a good idea, that blocking works better. I saw his post because it was RT'd by <a href="https://twitter.com/de1ong">Brad DeLong</a>, an economic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Bradford_DeLong">historian</a> at UC-Berkeley. I chimed in -- "You are right. They are trolling you, [and when you mute them] you just don't know it." And even if you block them, they can and do still go one-on-one with people who engage with you, and there are no tools on Twitter to stop that. But at least when you block them you keep them from broadcasting to everyone who follows you.  Bottom-line: Block trolls, don't mute.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/17.html#a125711" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

You can't separate the people from the group. In that sense, no matter whether you voted for Hillary or Jill or Bernie, or whether you marched with a <a href="https://www.pussyhatproject.com/">pussy hat</a>, or write angry tweets, if you're an American, you're complicit. Eventually you will be blamed for what America is doing, and that's fair and just.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/17/132559.html#a132605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132837"></a>Truth is, Americans are lazy. How did we get this way? We let two wars be fought in the 2000s, with no draft, not only no wartime tax increase, but a tax <i>cut. </i>And we let the government get away with not showing the returning flag-draped coffins. We fought two wars in Asia (still are, btw) and you'd never know it at home. That imho is a crime. You shouldn't be able to fight a war without feeling a lot of pain.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/17/132559.html#a132837" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132730"></a>With that in mind, maybe we should be doing more than being outraged at why the Republicans don't act. Remember Gandhi <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/24499-be-the-change-that-you-wish-to-see-in-the">said</a> "Be the change that you wish to see in the world." In other words, in more American terms, stop waiting for other people to save your ass, risk some of <i>your</i> security for the greater good. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/17/132559.html#a132730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133017"></a>Off the top of my head I thought of something we can do right now. Stop. Don't go to work for the rest of the week. Don't buy anything. Stay home, or go out and march. Stop the US economy. Make it clear what we want. Trump either resigns or the House impeaches him. There's plenty of time between now and Friday to do that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/17/132559.html#a133017" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134414"></a>If we ground the economy to a stop that would make the world take note. Very likely the big companies would join the protest, and people around the world would join too. We fancy the US is the leader of the free world (obviously our president no longer is). How about a little of that famous leadership, from the people of the United States?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/17/132559.html#a134414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
