Whenever we write, imho, we're saying something simple. This is what I see. These are my values. This is what it's like to be me. By showing yourself, you become vulnerable, and that has a cost. Better to be safe. But sometimes you have so much to say, the pain is so great, it has to come out. One thing I've discovered in a life of ups and downs -- it's true -- it's darkest just before dawn. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/21.html#a131520" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a163813"></a>I'm a conservative. Something former-Republican conservatives can probably relate to. I think the vast majority of Americans who are freaked out about the Trump presidency could legitimately be described as conservative. However I've been voting solid Democratic since 2004.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/21/163809.html#a163813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a163829"></a>For me, a bridge too far was the Iraq war. By 2004 we knew there were no WMDs, that the government had lied to us. This was huge. On such a serious matter as war or peace, you can't do what they did and keep the support of good Americans. At the moment they're talking about <a href="https://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2017/07/19/dont-want-smoking-gun-mushroom-cloud/">mushroom clouds</a> you need to suck it up and trust the government has seen something unthinkable that you can't see. Not lying out of their ass, as the Bushies were. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/21/163809.html#a163829" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a164023"></a>Yes, I firmly believe in Choice, am in favor of radical gun control, I have a serious pre-existing condition, so I get how important health insurance is.

	<li><a name="a164055"></a>Change is continuous. A country that still hasn't shaken off the legacy of slavery isn't going to transform into a European socialist country in a generation.

It's time to compromise. We need to elect a president we'd all like to have a cup of coffee with. Not someone who wags his finger and talks over us. Who doesn't listen.
