The more followers you have the more incentive there is to post something inflammatory as a reply. Muting is nice, but it only prevents them from replying to you. Long after you've stopped seeing their trollish droppings, they are still getting flow for their abuse with replies. On some posts, no replies, please. Or replies only visible to me, no one else. Or replies only from people I follow. Or, as Facebook does, let the originator of the post remove trollish comments. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/24.html#a154528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153153"></a>Getting a late start today after wrestling with hoisting and fighting back a summer cold. Still going bike riding this afternoon. It's so good for my state of well-being. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/24.html#a153153" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-type="outline"><a name="a133840"></a>I have been getting <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/22.html">hoisting</a> to work in my editing environment for Scripting News. I think I have it working now. If you're reading this, <i>something</i> is working. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/24/161215.html#a133840" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline"><a name="a150634"></a>Let me just say this. Hoisting is hard. Especially if you're retrofitting it into an existing app. This is good practice for getting it working inside <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a>, which after a short burn-in period is the next thing on my to-do list. Might take a few days to get there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/24/161215.html#a150634" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
