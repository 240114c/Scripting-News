<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a014113"></a>So many security schemes are based on the control of phone numbers. But itâ€™s relatively easy to <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3q7mz/hacker-allegedly-stole-millions-bitcoin-sim-swapping">hijack</a> phone numbers. They're also the weak link in most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">2FA</a> systems. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/30.html#a014113" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a175318"></a>I skipped season 5 of Orange Is The New Black. Was that a mistake? Is season 6 any good?? (Apparently so. I'm going to get started on season 5.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/30.html#a175318" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a130518"></a>Note: A few mild spoilers, nothing imho that would interfere with the full-on HMT experience, until the very end, well labeled, which you should not read until you've watched the show. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/30/125641.html#a130518" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a125702"></a>It's super dark and depressing. The first few episodes aren't too bad, that gets you hooked, and then you're in for 10 hours of very seriously depressing stuff, with only a few outlets for the rage that builds. A trip to Toronto, for example, reminds you that the rest of the world is still as it was. It's just the US, now called <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/30/gilead.png">Gilead</a>, that's gone crazy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/30/125641.html#a125702" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Pretty <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zero-tolerance-border-separations-permanent-ice-director-2018-6">timely</a> for the US. It was also timely for me, since my mother died earlier this year. It helped me better understand our relationship from her side. Perhaps. I think they idealize motherhood a bit. I think that's also deeply ingrained in our culture, perhaps because mothers have so much influence over how we perceive reality from the beginning of our lives.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/30/125641.html#a125822" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a130028"></a>It does the job of a good binge-watch. You get pulled into its reality. This last weekend I was in the Handmaid's Tale world. I had no patience for the news in the real world of 2018. All I could think about was the pack of lies they're selling as news. I felt I was getting a better idea of our world by watching the fictional world of HMT. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/30/125641.html#a130028" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
