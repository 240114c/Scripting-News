<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a022140"></a>You can see in this <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/01/radio3List.png">image</a> when Facebook turned off the cross-posting API. It's a screen shot of <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> -- the tool I use for linkblogging. It's amazing this has gotten almost no coverage in the press. It's like a tunnel under the Hudson was terminated, where FB is New Jersey and everything else is Manhattan (or vice versa, it doesn't matter). Only this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/psa-cross-posting-tweets-to-facebook-no-longer-works-as-of-today/">TechCrunch story</a>.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a205957"></a>A big downside of ceding economic leadership to China is that their norms of freedom will become the norms of the world. Once Google's search engine <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/">censors</a> access to the net in China, it's just a matter of time before they do it in the west too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/01.html#a205957" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I called the product <a href="http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf">HighFiles</a>, for high level file system. That's how I thought of it. We found a copy of this document in my mom's house back in February. Finally got around to scanning it. It's a time capsule. Some ideas I didn't think I had that early, and some absolute <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shaking%20my%20head">SMH</a> things, which I'm now putting on the record. I was only 24 back in 1979. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/01.html#a194731" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
