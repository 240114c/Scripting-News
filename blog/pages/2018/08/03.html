	<li><a name="a144432"></a>Good morning. The <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/testing/1.8.0/">new version</a> of LO2 is ready for testing.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html#a144432" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144445"></a>I've completed most of the features planned for this release, so it's a good time for people who'd like to help to start using the new version. I've made a backup of all the outlines, in case there are any data-losing bugs in the software. I don't think there are, because I've used it myself fairly thoroughly, and there aren't many changes to the core outliner in this release. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html#a144445" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144625"></a>If you encounter any problems or have questions, please post an item in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/91">this thread</a> on the Scripting News repo. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html#a144625" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a144644"></a>Here's a quick list of the new stuff.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html#a144644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li><a name="a144702"></a>Hoisting. There are two new commands in the Outliner menu, Hoist and Dehoist, and two icons in the sidebar, the two pushpins. The commands and pushpins are enabled when the operations are possible. For example, you can only hoist if a headline has subs. You can only dehoist if something is hoisted. You can nest hoists. As far as I know there is no limit to the number of levels. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html#a144702" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144750"></a>The crumbtrail. At the top of the outline display is the crumb trail that leads back to the summit from the location of the bar cursor. You can click on any of the links to move the cursor back to that spot. The navigation undoes hoists if necessary. It's a good way to keep track of your context while you're focusing on a specific part of your outline.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html#a144750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144854"></a>The SAVED/NOT SAVED indicator. LO2 automatically saves your work. You can keep track of that by watching this indicator, just above the tabs, in the right margin. You may find it reassuring to know that your work is saved. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgsMANmu9qo&feature=youtu.be">Demo</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html#a144854" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145032"></a>Integrated thesaurus. To start navigating the thesaurus, enter a word in a headline, click the suitcase icon and add a <i>type</i> attribute with the value word. Expand it the headline, and synonyms for the word, if any can be found, will fill in as subheads. Then you can expand any of its subheads to find synonyms. It is the basic functionality of the <a href="http://thesaurus.land/">thesaurus.land</a> application, integrated in LO2.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html#a145032" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a011016"></a>My friend Stan Krute on Facebook wrote how astonished he is about conspiracy theories that real people believe in. I wrote a series of three comments, which I've included here, lightly edited.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/011011.html#a011016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a011116"></a>My uncle, well educated, highly literate, creative, believed lots of conspiracy theories, and the people he hung out with did too. I believed a few myself when I was younger. So I have some familiarity with it. I think it’s a way of coping with the complexity and dishonesty of everything.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/011011.html#a011116" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a011152"></a>My parents too, when it came to Israel, had lots of what I considered irrational conspiracy like beliefs. Also very literate, highly educated, urban, liberal people.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/011011.html#a011152" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a011208"></a>Eventually as I grew older I got closer to the real power in the world, and understood that it’s just as confusing to the people at the top as it is to the people on the bottom.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/011011.html#a011208" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
