<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a234137"></a> I'd like to add that when I swim my body exudes good feelings from every cell.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/10/sadBeatles.png"><a name="a121444"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/10/sadBeatles.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I got an email in the middle of the night asking if I had seen an <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/blog/2018/07/13/upcoming-changes/">announcement</a> from Berkman Center at Harvard that they will stop hosting blogs.harvard.edu. It's not clear what will happen to the archives. Let's have a discussion about this. That was the first academic blog hosting system anywhere. It was where we planned and reported on our Berkman Thursday meetups, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon">BloggerCon</a>. It's where the first podcasts were hosted. When we tried to figure out what makes a weblog a weblog, that's where the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html">result</a> was posted. There's a lot of history there. I can understand turning off the creation of new posts, making the old blogs read-only, but as a university it seems to me that Harvard should have a strong interest in maintaining the archive, in case anyone in the future wants to study the role we played in starting up these (as it turns out) important human activities. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a121444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a122245"></a>Also, thankfully it's not where the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0 spec</a> is stored, but it was originally posted on one of the Berkman blogs. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a122245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a133051"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1027820744196202496">In a tweet</a>: "Throwing out this archive is like throwing out an academic journal. Why would a university do that? One of the reasons we did this work at a university was the hope/expectation it would survive over time. Only 15 years later, they want to throw it away?"<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a133051" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a122844"></a>John Palfrey, former executive director of Berkman wrote the <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/project-info/">project info page</a> for blogs.harvard.edu in 2011. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a122844" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a123459"></a>I just looked for some of the old 2003-2004 sites, and they're already gone. Earlier this year we <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/204408.html">lost the handle</a> on <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/">Radio UserLand</a> weblogs because the <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/about.html">new owner</a> of weblogs.com was unwilling to maintain a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/">DNS entry</a> pointing to them. That and Google's marking HTTP sites as <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">not secure</a> have been huge blows to the web as an archival medium. It's a good time to pause and reflect on the question of what was the value of all the work, and why bother continuing if the people who should care, a major university, a large research company and one of the largest tech companies, don't care about maintaining the web. What hope is there for it being maintained in the future?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a123459" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125041"></a>I posted a <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/berkman-thursday/conversations/messages/2902">note</a> on the Berkman-Thursday mail list which, amazingly, is still operating. Sarcastically, I don't see Yahoo saying they're getting ready to take it offline. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üí•</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a125041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125809"></a>When I left Berkman I archived <a href="http://crimson1.scripting.com/">my test site</a> from the Harvard server, and it's still here on scripting.com, and I'll do my best to keep it around. I used it to post pictures and ask stupid questions, and try out new features in the software. There are pictures of people I've known for a long time and haven't seen in ages but still love. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a125809" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
