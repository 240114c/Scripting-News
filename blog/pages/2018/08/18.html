<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a170007"></a>Everyone's experience with Twitter is different. As is every person's experience with podcasting; and everything else in life. To say Twitter is boring or abusive or whatever is like making an equivalent statement about movies or the telephone or travel.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/18.html#a170007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a170229"></a>I'm in season 3 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a> now. Very different experience from the first time through when I watched the episodes as they came out. One thing that's clear is that it's a comedy. And they sometimes had a blast in the writer's room, with puns and characters finishing each others' speeches. I know in advance some characters are doomed, which is disturbing. And I had forgotten how evil some characters are. Not Swearengen though. He's a poet and hippie. Has limited ambition. That isn't clear in the first season, but by the third he's matured, as has Bullock, to become peacemakers even civil rights advocates.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/18.html#a170229" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
