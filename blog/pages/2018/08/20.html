He's naming the project <a href="http://inessential.com/2018/08/20/rainier_diary_9_the_renaming">Ranier</a>. I like it, esp because the last three letters are ier, which says the foundation originated in Frontier, but it also frees up Brent to follow the product where it wants to go. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/20.html#a174351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153605"></a>Journalism has lots of problems, but the really big one is that distribution is a mess. There needs to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">EU</a> of news. And a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro">euro</a>. It's no longer an idea for the future, it's a model that should have been implemented long ago, and we should be growing based on it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/20.html#a153605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a184127"></a>If the news wants to be effective it should spend some amount of time not just describing our quagmire, but having realistic discussions for what we can do to dig out of it. There's no discussion of this on MSNBC as far as I know. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/20/184117.html#a184127" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Boycotts and picket lines. Those are proper citizen responses to treason on the part of the president. These ideas should be present in the press coverage. But if you put off accepting as fact the corruption of the government, you don't have to cross that bridge.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/20/184117.html#a184150" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
