<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153718"></a>I want a bank/brokerage website that has an easy UI. I don't care about commissions. My auto insurance company website is fast and easy. This builds trust, believe it or not. Nothing is worse than a bank that can't run a proper website. It's 2018, some bank should excel by now.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/25.html#a153718" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154519"></a>What I hate most about Chrome's <font size="-1">NOT SECURE</font> message is that this is all they could think of to say about <a href="http://scripting.com/">my wonderful blog</a>. A blog that predates Google itself by four years. It's got humor and sadness, fun and tech tips. Yet all they can say is yuck we don't like this site. We welcomed Google. Even <a href="http://scripting.com/2002/01/10.html#yupTheUsersCared">loved</a> them. And this is what's become of them. Heartless and soulless. Bullies. No love. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/25.html#a154519" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Yesterday I saw two bright red bikes, shaped like a Lime bike or CitiBike, with a plastic basket up front. Didn't have time to read the logo/branding. Both in Manhattan. Andy DeSoto <a href="https://twitter.com/kadesoto/status/1033354917656911872">says</a> they're Jump bikes. And guess what, they say on <a href="https://jumpbikes.com/cities/new-york-city/">their site</a> they're available now in NYC. (But only in Staten Island and Westchester.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/25.html#a140424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141752"></a>I've been saying this for <i>decades.</i> Every brand should have an iconic image that bloggers can crib. What that means is this -- a product shot on a white or transparent background. Large enough for large product shots, and for right margin images, we can make them smaller. I wanted to put a <a href="https://jumpbikes.com/">Jump</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jumpbikes">bike</a> in the right margin, but when I do an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&biw=1383&bih=1186&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=4mSBW9uWH8mc_Qa7r4vYBw&q=jump+bike+share+red&oq=jump+bike+share+red&gs_l=img.3...7026.8128.0.8463.6.6.0.0.0.0.151.585.3j3.6.0....0...1c.1.64.img..2.1.67...0i24k1.0.pDhlh-JQAjE">image search</a>, all I see are bikes being ridden or parked with lots of not-easily cropped backgrounds. No free advertising for Jump. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/25.html#a141752" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140504"></a>I have a friend who's an accomplished computer scientist, really smart and creative in that area. Also a good teacher. But in politics he's a snotty bastard, he uses logic that could never work in debugging code. I wonder how such contradictions happen? Really puzzling.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/25.html#a140504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Whether you took the subway, walked, came by spaceship or were driven by your chauffeur. What’s important is you’re here. That's also the philosophy of America, btw.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/25.html#a150609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
