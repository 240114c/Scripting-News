<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143656"></a>What can <i>you</i> do to help? Unfollow people who RT the <a href="http://this.how/trolls/">troll</a>. Trolls feed on flow. Deprive them of flow, they shrivel up and die. People who RT him are undermining our future. Unfollow without a second thought. Eventually they'll get the message that RTing him has a cost.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/28.html#a143656" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a211743"></a>There’s a big disconnect about what the First Amendment is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/28/211723.html#a211743" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a211815"></a>But it’s more than a law, it represents a basic American  value. We believe that speech is a right and must be protected.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/28/211723.html#a211815" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a211850"></a>So when in doubt a company should protect the speech of its employees and customers. Not must but should. Esp if it wants us to see it as American.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/28/211723.html#a211850" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a211915"></a>If you try to get someone fired because you don’t like their opinion, you may be entitled to do that, but you are being intolerant and un-American. You should support everyone’s right to express their ideas. You don’t have to, but you should, if you want to be an American.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/28/211723.html#a211915" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a143557"></a>He downloads the DMG, extracts the OPML folder, runs the app, and gets a dialog asking where the root is. You're not supposed to get this dialog. OPML.app is supposed to look for and automatically open opml.root in the same folder as the app. This isn't happening.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/28/141559.html#a143557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="a141725"></a>I have been able to reproduce it here. To try to narrow down the problem, I created a virgin OPML folder, zipped it, copied it to another folder, unzipped it, ran the app and it worked as it's supposed to. I then uploaded the zipped file, downloaded it, unzipped as before, ran the app, and got the behavior Frank describes. If you want to try it, you can download the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/39lkdbd5cu2kc5e/OPML.zip?dl=1">zip file</a> from my Dropbox.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/28/141559.html#a141725" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141907"></a>I wrote a script to compare the original zip file with the downloaded file. They are identical. Something is happening when the zip file is uncompressed? Not sure. I don't have the ability to look inside the OPML app to see what's tripping it up. This is new behavior. I am having trouble coming up with theories to try. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/28/141559.html#a141907" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
