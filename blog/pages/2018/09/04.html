<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a163309"></a>Updated: <a href="http://this.how/scriptingNews/nightlyArchive.opml">How I archive Scripting News</a>. I’ve been backing up my blog to a GitHub repository for the last year.

I think this is possibly a cleansing process. It'll force people to look at what exactly it is they're against. Whether Kaepernick might be a patriot and not a pariah.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/04.html#a144332" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
