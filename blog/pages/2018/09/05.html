<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/05/bug.png"><a name="a162220"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/05/bug.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/09/04/medium-domain-name">says</a> what we're thinking. Why, if you can't map a domain to your site on Medium, would you use it to host a blog. Rafat Ali, another longtime blogger, <a href="https://twitter.com/rafat/status/1037371592496570372">says</a> once Medium shuts down there should be an ethical replacement. I wonder <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037372465599668225">why</a> they can't co-exist, and then <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037372969520168961">answer</a> my own question. The problem isn't cost, or the tech -- it's users. Medium has momentum, still, as the place-of-record for web writing, much as YouTube is it for video. It's a shaky foundation. No business model, huge money already invested. Not a good situation.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/05.html#a162220" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154522"></a>Here's a conundrum. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/05/potusOnTwitter.png">This</a> appeared in my Twitter timeline. It's from @potus. I must have followed that account when Obama was president. Now Trump is using it. 24 million followers. Do I have to block it? What about the next president? For now I'll just unfollow, but it might have to be blocked, if he uses it in a more troll-like fashion. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/05.html#a154522" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="tweet" data-tweetId="1037348784710279168" data-tweetUserName="davewiner"><a name="a143409"></a>I think there's a place for a simple RSS-based Instagram clone. Subscribe as in an RSS reader, with the URL of a feed. It displays items with &lt;enclosure>s that are images. Wouldn't have as many users as IG, but IG was fun before it had so many users.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/05.html#a143409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I think outliners are a great way to write readme files, that's how I've always done it. I just added this feature to my nightly archive app, and created this little demo app as a byproduct. It contains a fair amount of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlToGitHub/blob/master/opmltogithub.js">code</a> that might prove useful in other apps.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141154"></a>I'm using GitHub more and more as a platform. Part of the reason is that it was on my path. My GitHub code has been maturing, and my project to get more future-safe is progressing. But I am aware that it's now owned by Microsoft. I wonder if they see GitHub in a compatible way to how I'm using it? That's something you have to worry about when building on a corporate platform. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/05.html#a141154" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125208"></a>Continuing to scrub my Twitter feed of troll RTers. A few every day. When will people figure out that <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/22/151134.html">RTing a troll</a> just gives them power.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/05.html#a125208" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
