<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a015818"></a>Radical idea -- Nike runs ads praising people for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nike-advert-with-colin-kaepernick-has-people-burning-products-2018-9">burning</a> their Nikes in protest. "That's what we were talking about," they might say. Of course they can't, because the only thing Nike ever says is "Just do it." It's up to their spokespeopler to say things other than that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/07.html#a015818" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He talks about voting the way I talk about the open web. People think it's my fight. They're wrong. It's our fight. If you don't help, it won't happen. And so far it seems to me we're headed for a Trump-like loss on the web. You'll miss it when it's gone. I was sure that Google's trying to own the open web wouldn't stop with <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">attacking HTTP</a>. They didn't even wait a month before launching the next attack on web addresses. There was no resistance, why should they wait?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/07.html#a173604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
