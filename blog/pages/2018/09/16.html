As I've said many times in this discussion, I'm just one person here, I like to tinker, but I'm doing other things in my life these days that right now are taking more of my attention. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/16/171347.html#a171352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a174809"></a>With limited time for playing with my web stuff, I can't consider using that time to jump through the hoops of random huge companies. They'll keep coming up with more and bigger hoops. Even if I do what they want now, at some point I won't be able to keep up. Ultimately, I'm just a statistic, some percentage of web traffic, a very small percentage. Net-net: I don't care about them, and they don't care about me. Cool. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/16/171347.html#a174809" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a171824"></a>It's pretty clear they're going to whittle away at the web. AMP and Let's Encrypt, next up they're going after <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/172768/google-wants-to-kill-urls-in-chrome">URLs</a>. It doesn't make sense. Why not just jump straight ahead to the simple safe thing they have in mind. When they're done, it won't be the web. Certainly in their internal debates <i>someone</i> must be saying this. If you don't like the person you're married to, instead of trying to change them, marry someone you like better. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/16/171347.html#a171824" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a173211"></a>PS: Something like this happened with Apple and podcasting. They offered to promote my product, but I'd have to convert it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">iOS</a> first. I thought it works perfectly well as a web app. So I said no. I'm sure it would have been fun to be featured by Apple, but I've been on that trip before, and I don't like how it <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/unknown_133991">ends</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/16/171347.html#a173211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a180303"></a>PPS: A quote from <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/01/19.html#When:12:26:30PM">2005</a>: "BTW, the bigco's will whisper sweet nothings into the ears of their 'third parties' but as they're doing it, you're being guided into the trunk of the car, while they ride up front. The clicking sound you hear is the lock engaging. The whooshing sound is the <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/676103/Microsoft-executive-denies-threat-to-cut-off-air-supply.html">air supply</a> being cut off." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/16/171347.html#a180303" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
