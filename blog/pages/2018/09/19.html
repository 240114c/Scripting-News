Such is the case for this <a href="http://dev.opml.org/json/">OPML to JSON</a> converter app. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/19.html#a151906" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When someone is attacked online, don't assume there are actual people doing the attacking. By now we should all be aware of Russian strategies for making us hate each other. And no doubt others have learned the craft. This story is as old as the net. <i>3 minutes.</i> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/19.html#a143326" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a154916"></a>I remember hearing on the NYT Daily podcast a couple of weeks ago that the Kavanaugh confirmation was locked in. Not even the slightest doubt. I objected, you never know what can happen. A sports fan would <i>never</i> say something like that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/19/154910.html#a154916" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a155020"></a>We're at peak Republican power, if the rest of us do it right. Repubs have optimized the flaws in the Constitution to enable the maximum concentration of wealth. PCs were instrumental, esp in gerrymandering. But the net works against the Repubs, because now people can organize, if we resist the automated methods that keep us disorganized.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/19/154910.html#a155020" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155109"></a>Now is a good time, a very good time, for the people to make their presence felt by the few senators needed to set back the Republican march. They just need to know we see them in this moment and are taking careful notes on what they do, right now.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/19/154910.html#a155109" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
