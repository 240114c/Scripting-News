What process led the NYT to run its <a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/180921/p69#a180921p69">piece</a> today? It looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_journalism">access journalism</a>. Was it? Did they consider the consequences? It looks fake, btw. Was it? It feels like they sold us out, as they have been doing <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/02/butHerEmailsBig.png">starting</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy">Hillary's emails</a> (actually before that, in the <a href="https://observer.com/2015/04/judith-miller-carried-water-for-the-usas-worst-debacle-since-vietnam/">buildup</a> to the Iraq War).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/21.html#a020742" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I write my development notes in OPML, and would like to have them be directly readable in GitHub. OPML has been stable for 18 years and RSS for 16. I think it would be safe to support them now. And this raises a question, can there be a process for vetting the code and adding it to the native capabilities of GitHub? I think most of the expertise in these formats exists outside their company. Are we ready for this kind of collaboration?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/21.html#a145813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
