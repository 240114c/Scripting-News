That would probably do more to improve the lives of all Americans than any other single thing. It's like the SuperBowl, the NBA Finals, Coachella or the Oscars, only better -- because <i>we</i> are the stars. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/22.html#a160043" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174447"></a>I've got <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> working with my <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/17/145629.html">GitHub as CMS</a> experiment. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/myEnglishBlog/blob/master/blog/posts/2018/09/22/174921.md">example</a> of a post so you can see what it looks like. This is exactly equivalent to using JSON, my server converts back and forth between YAML and JSON, so my app only ever sees the JSON. Every time I have to teach my software a new text-to-binary format, I shake my fist at a cloud and curse humanity. Some kid is going to come along in five years and not like YAML and there will be ZML or JDAUGHTER or whatever. Will they all do the same thing? Yes of course they will. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/22.html#a174447" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152521"></a>I'm rolling through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(miniseries)">Maniac</a> on Netflix and loving it. Jonah Hill, Emma Stone, Justin Theroux, Sally Field. Hill and Stone are incredible together. It's a bit of everything, The Matrix, Inception, Big Lebowski, Cloud Atlas, so many other things. I'm just starting episode 7 and rationing it. I don't want it to be over. It's the best thing in a long time.  Update: Other movies it borrows from -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>, Borat and The Graduate. Also Good Will Hunting. Best line: Gas up the Miata!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/22.html#a152521" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
