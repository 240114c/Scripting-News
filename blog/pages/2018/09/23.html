One that's free of the tech industry. Chrome was good when Firefox got slow and unfocused. And Firefox was good when MSIE was malware-infested and stagnant. But none of them were or are user-driven.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a172510"></a>I don't see the point of polling for ordinary people. I get why political consultants and candidates would care. Even donors. But why should a voter care? I can't imagine ever making a decision on who to vote for based on poll results.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/23.html#a172510" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
