A real <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/25/kimSpoiler.png">curveball</a>. The creation story of Saul Goodman took a surprising and sexy/interesting turn. I wish there were a <a href="http://spoilers.io/">site</a> where I could write all about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/25.html#a232900" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Noah's career is disintegrating. He could probably play again if he gave the Knicks a discount on what's left in his contract. For now they can blame it on the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/02/03/the-phil-jackson-era-isnt-over-until-his-biggest-stink-bomb-is-gone/">old management</a>.

Most of what you read on Facebook is bullshit. So maybe connecting with all those people just creates new ways for bullshit to flow and aggregate, leading to some really awful stuff happening, as we have seen. If you're short on time, skip to the end and watch their honest commercial for Facebook. It's really good, funny, and thought provoking. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/25.html#a151130" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a172826"></a><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/25.html#a151130">John Oliver</a> is right about Facebook. And the thing is we knew it would be, because we came from there. There was always a bunch of bullshit on mail lists, that's why we found new ways to collaborate, in the primeval days of the web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/25/172652.html#a172826" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a172720"></a>We built Web 2.0 on those ideas, but then SV decided to scale it and centralize it, and people liked it, because they believed it was a human experience. Why not?
