<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a022127"></a><a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/26/park.png">This</a>. Civic space, open to all, on the left. The most expensive real estate in the world, to the right. The net should look like this too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/26.html#a022127" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a211233"></a>Great bike ride today, might be the last summer-weather ride of 2018. It's 82 and humid. It's a fluke for it to be this warm on Sept 26. There's nothing like a good workout to improve the spirits. It's chemical. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/26.html#a211233" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a194150"></a>Continuing work on the new githubpub. One of the ideas I've been working towards is a similar kind of <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html">hierarchy</a> in the repo as we had in the Frontier object database. I don't think it's practical to do the data gathering the website framework does as part of building a page. But there's a compromise, the idea of a default location. If I look for a template, for example, and don't find it in your database (i.e. repository), I then look in the system repo. It works. Not as cool as a completely hierarchic system, but two levels is better than one.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/26.html#a194150" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143038"></a><a href="http://history.userland.com/">Here's a page</a> with a list of all the <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/manual/chapter06.html">object databases</a> for userland.com websites, available for download. Many of the sites are still running, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jsavin">Jake Savin</a>. I want to be sure that in the future as much of what we created at UserLand is preserved. You need a copy of Frontier or the <a href="http://home.opml.org/">OPML Editor</a> to read these files. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/26.html#a143038" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142959"></a>Twitter and Facebook turned us all into attention junkies. Before that, blogging. Before that, I have no recollection of life before that. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/26.html#a142959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
