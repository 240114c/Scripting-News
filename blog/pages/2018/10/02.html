<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a021728"></a>I’ve been developing a blogging system that uses Github as the backend. It’s end-user software, but also is extensible by developers. GIT is itself a distributed system. Shows promise re <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html">for-the-record</a> writing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/02.html#a021728" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Kavanaugh disqualified himself with these <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/02/kavanaughExcerpt.png">three paragraphs</a> from his <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/misc/kavanaughTranscript.md">testimony</a> on Thursday.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/02.html#a212034" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a212415"></a>Re Democrats ruining Kavanaugh's life -- The legal system ruins lots of lives. Kavanaugh isn't special. I'm sure he's ruined a few lives himself. We should have more sympathy and grace for the Supreme Court. Putting a openly partisan hack on the court means no one will respect its decisions in the future. Not presidents, not the military, not you and I.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/02.html#a212415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144937"></a>I'm now about as good in JavaScript as I was in C or Frontier. I make the same number of mistakes in my code in JS as in the other environments, but in Frontier, I cruised through most of the fixes in a fraction of the time it takes in JS. Debugging was much faster, the data was right there in a browsable, live-editable structure. I couldn't make a statement about that before because I wasn't as proficient in JS. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/02.html#a144937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
