<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a163612"></a>Trump pretended he didn't know what the KKK is when David Duke endorsed him. He led cheers of "Lock her up" referring to Hillary Clinton. He praised Nazis who marched in Charlottesville and ran down a crowd, killing a woman. And so much more. This is a depraved narcissistic madman. A very dangerous person. So you're surprised he dissed Dr Ford? It was 100% predictable.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03.html#a163612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If it catches on, inevitably someone tries to commercialize it. Often they are successful and the open version languishes. We should pay attention <i>before</i> it's commercialized, and understand the freedom that comes from its openness. This came up in a <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/01/141620.html">piece</a> I wrote on Monday. Let's appreciate the Joni Mitchell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUo9C1vUt0A">view</a> of things: there's something inherently good and sweet about the "one-man band by the quick lunch stand."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03.html#a161652" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a143758"></a>I've become email friends with <a href="https://twitter.com/davegandy">Dave Gandy</a>, the founder of <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>. I can't sing the praises of that product high enough. It's a life saver, if it didn't exist, I'd still be stealing graphics and they'd suck as icons. FA takes care of an important part of the UI of the web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a143758" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143911"></a>Second disclaimer, I juggle so many external technologies I don't have the bandwidth to dive into any of them too deeply, so when I think I uncover a problem, very often it's just a lack of info, a misunderstanding, or due to the fact that I exist in a perpetual state of developer fog.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a143911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a144626"></a>OK with those disclaimers, here's the narrative:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a144626" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li><a name="a144009"></a>I use <a href="https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor">Medium-Editor</a> in some of my projects. It uses Font Awesome for parts of its UI. I also use Font Awesome in all my projects. I recently upgraded to version 5.2.0. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a144009" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144102"></a>I notice that the tool bar in my Medium Editor instance has breakage. The big H for H2 and H4 are missing their H's which are Font Awesome objects. <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icon/header/">fa-header</a> specifically. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a144102" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a190509"></a>Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/03/mediumEditorToolbar.png">screen shot</a> showing what the toolbar looks like when it's working properly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a190509" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144223"></a>On investigation it appears it is missing in 5.2.0. But the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons/heading">fa-heading</a> object looks very much like the original fa-header. Is it possible they changed its name?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a144223" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144340"></a>I look to see what version of Font Awesome the Medium-Editor <a href="http://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/">demo</a> uses. It's 4.4.0. So I try including that version in my app and <i>the H's come back.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a144340" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="a144416"></a>So my conclusion is there is breakage between Medium-Editor and Font Awesome. I am downgrading this app to use the old version of FA. However, there was a reason I upgraded, so my software is in a weird state of disrepair as a result of this workaround.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a144416" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144514"></a>If they did indeed change from fa-header to fa-heading, my request is DON'T DO THAT.  The world has built on your icons. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics">aesthetics</a> at this point do not matter. If you think the icons are misnamed, you are wrong. Please refer to the disclaimers at the top of this post. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/03/143747.html#a144514" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
