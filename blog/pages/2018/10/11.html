<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a230936"></a>I also <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/elizabethwarrenforma">gave</a> $25 to Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, to help make sure she is re-elected. Have a look at <a href="http://scripting.com/misc/senate2018/">this list</a> of all the candidates for Senator in 2018, with links to their ActBlue donation pages. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11.html#a230936" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155418"></a>Our big sin, which we will keep paying for, is that we fought two wars without a draft and while lowering taxes not raising them. War must cause pain at home. One way or another you eventually have to feel it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11.html#a155418" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/11/dominoTheory.png"><a name="a150745"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/11/dominoTheory.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">If you asked my father what Dave's favorite music is, he would have told you what his favorite music is, and (importantly) he'd think he's answering the question. If you ask someone why Dave works so hard, he'll tell you what he aspires to. He might say Dave does it to get rich. That wouldn't tell you anything about Dave, but it likely tells you something about him. This is important to understanding disputes, and is why listening is so important. For example, the US thought North Vietnam was fighting because they were part of a global communist alliance to defeat the west. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory">Domino Theory</a>. Because we were at war against that. The Vietnamese were actually fighting a war of independence, and were puzzled why the US, a former colony that fought for its independence, was fighting them. Moral of the story: Unless you ask, you probably don't know why someone is doing what they do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11.html#a150745" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When you put people on stage speaking, they have had so much time to prepare, they have slides for everything they thought of while they were preparing, and sometimes that was months. So it takes forever for them to get to the point. Or they don't do much prep, and they just play back the pitch they made to VCs or play the deck they used on their press tour.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11/140350.html#a140358" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140422"></a>Or they're blowhard CEOs, so full of themselves they hardly know anyone else is there. I once heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison">Larry Ellison</a> speak at a tech industry conference where he thought he was talking to an Oracle User Group! At least we got to hear what he says to them (it was mostly press, financial types and his competitors). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11/140350.html#a140422" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140456"></a>I stumbled across a different format in the 00s that we called an <i>unconference,</i> a name that has since been usurped by a different format. In <a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html">our format</a>, it's a discussion group with a leader at the front who interviews the room. It has to be someone who knows who's there, and has an idea for a story, and has a hardass attitude about people droning, repeating, and self-serving. With someone who knows what they're doing, it's something to behold. Everyone is on their toes, involved. And you can be called on, so you can't afford to lose track of what's going on in the room. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11/140350.html#a140456" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140520"></a>I find professors and reporters make good moderators. The more opinionated they are the better. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11/140350.html#a140520" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140521"></a>The <a href="https://twitter.com/newsgeist?lang=en">Newsgeist</a> conference I went to a couple of years ago actually carries on that tradition, in some of the sessions. I wonder why? Maybe it's because <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a> is involved, and he was a big fan of the format back in the day.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11/140350.html#a140521" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140603"></a>What made me think of this is I've been getting email from <a href="https://poptech.org/">Poptech</a>, a conference in Maine in early November. It's totally about the speakers. Kind of <a href="https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences">TED</a>ish (though it's not a copy, it's a contemorary). I didn't know any of the speakers. I'm pretty sure I don't know any of the attendees. Why spend $2000 for that? Not that I didn't consider it, I did. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/11/140350.html#a140603" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
