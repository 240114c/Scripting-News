It would be even better if there were a way to buy say 100 years of service in advance. And the fact that GIT is so good at synchronization (it's what it was built for originally) is a great feature for a FSA. You could insure your insurance. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/21.html#a011433" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a151839"></a>I wish there was a Busy Developer's Guide to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Maybe there is? I am an experienced web CMS developer. I have implemented lots of frameworks. I'd love to see a concise how-it-works doc, with good examples. For example, I'd love to see a repo containing a Jekyll website that I can poke around in to see how the pieces fit together. It's one thing to read about it, the fastest way to learn is to see it in action. I'd also love to see a quick spec for what a Jekyll theme is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/21.html#a151839" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
