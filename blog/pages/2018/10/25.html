<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a192721"></a>It's really interesting to read my blog on <a href="http://scripting.com/2008/11/05.html">the day after</a> the election in 2008. It was a transitional day, as the day after this <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/07.html">Election Day</a> will <i>certainly</i> be, one way or the other. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/25.html#a192721" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a193224"></a>Note to self. Fix the 404 page on scripting.com. The current version is too cute by a mile. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/25.html#a193224" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a192835"></a>I was thanked via email yesterday for my political posts on <a href="http://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>. A funny thing for sure, because I was not aware that my blog posts appear there. I guess Manton must have hooked up my <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> feed to my account on his site. Or maybe I did it and forgot? Either way, it's good, the more people who can hear me the better. The magic of open formats and protocols at work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/25.html#a192835" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a191335"></a>I would much prefer if we sent <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45983862">800</a> students and teachers to the border to feed the refugees when they arrive. Give them new shoes, provided by Nike. Doctors and lawyers. Sing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsB2ulcb2K8">Star Spangled Banner</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/25.html#a191335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
