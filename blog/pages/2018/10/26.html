And they found Trump's programming running his mind. Don't miss this point. Now getting attacked by Trump, in his rallies and tweets, has a new measurable cost, one it didn't have before this week. We used to think (hope) his rallies and tweets were harmless. Now we know they are not.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/26.html#a031119" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Your browser can still read it. That's a minor miracle. If a tech company owned the web, it's almost certain it would have broken long ago. Because no one owns the web, it still works.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/26.html#a025402" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I commented "sign me up." Then someone <a href="https://twitter.com/bob2cleo/status/1055890152256618497">said</a> "That's the Democrats." And I thought "That's bullshit." You want to keep losing elections, keep demonizing white men. There's a lot of resentment building, the Repubs have figured out how to tap into it. On the other hand McMullen's theoretical party, by design, will care about everyone. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/26.html#a200529" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a193759"></a>If Trump were a regular citizen would the Secret Service arrest him for inciting violence against Democrats and journalists? Is he criminally liable for what his acolytes do at his behest? (BTW, Bernie never told anyone to attack Steve Scalise so that's bullshit.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/26.html#a193759" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Pre-existing conditions. You probably don't have any when you're young, so you can get insurance. They can't cut you off if you get one if you were previously covered (it would be something if they could, you could get cut off as soon as you need insurance). So starting and maintaining continuous coverage, even if you get insurance through a job, is a <b>good</b> idea. You never know when you might become a person with a P.E.C. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/26.html#a170605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
