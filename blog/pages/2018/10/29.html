I haven't hit any limits. It's slow-going only because I don't want to have to live with half-baked ideas long-term, as we did <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/manual/chapter06.html">with Frontier</a>. Obvious advantage here is that a big tech company is maintaining the back-end at scale with good economic terms. That is also its biggest disadvantage. On the other hand GIT is very much not exclusive to GitHub/Microsoft. So here's hoping haha that they don't <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=embrace+extend+site%3Ascripting.com&t=h_&ia=web">Embrace & Extend</a> devs out of the picture.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/29.html#a153727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a211844"></a>It never crossed my mind that Twitter should <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/twitter-should-kill-retweet/574321/">eliminate RT</a>.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/29.html#a211844" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a164546"></a>I've been thinking how software evolution works much like natural <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/22.html">evolution</a>. The more I learn, the better the fit. Now I understand why I like programming so much, esp projects that last years, even decades. If this is evolution, think about it, who's god? Haha. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/29.html#a164546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The resurrection will not be led by non-bloggers.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/29/201712.html#a201717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a201841"></a>Reminds me of a public debate I had with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yochai_Benkler">Yochai Benkler</a> many years ago. I was stating something like this, that the best software is developed by users. He asked if you had to have cancer to develop a treatment. He stumped me with that. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/29/201712.html#a201841" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a201842"></a>My response, many years later, is that blogging is not a disease, not something to be avoided, and the tools we have for it are for human expression. A scientist would not understand the language of the human blogger if she weren't herself a blogger.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/29/201712.html#a201842" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a201852"></a>On the other hand a cancer researcher has to think like the disease, not the human. There is no chance (as far as I can imagine) for the doctor to become the cancer. So the treatments have to be developed without the first-hand experience of being a user.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/29/201712.html#a201852" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
