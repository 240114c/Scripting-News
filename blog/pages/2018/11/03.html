<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a001820"></a>The brilliance of the design of our government is that we can have a mini-revolution very two years and an all-out revolution every four. But we are too spoiled and lazy to get this. If we fail to overthrow our Repub masters on Tuesday, we deserve what comes next.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/03.html#a001820" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The new iMac Pro desktop is up to date. This caused its own problems. I edit my blog in an outliner that saves to a Dropbox-sync'd folder. This way I can use the same editor on my laptop when I'm traveling. I reloaded the editor this morning, the month of November was gone. I guess overnight Dropbox replaced the new version with the old version. It has missed the last few days of my work. Luckily I was also writing the OPML to a server, so I had a backup copy. I could have always re-entered the text from the website, so it wasn't ever in danger of being lost. Not sure what the moral of the story is. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/03.html#a132626" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
