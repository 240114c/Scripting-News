It's a way to tell me that you saw what I wrote and found it likeable. It doesn't mean you necessarily agree. You're also registering your presence to other people who read this blog. Maybe it's more like a ping? Hmmm. I know the Like icon doesn't show up in your feed reader (maybe that can change) but it may be worth a trip to <a href="http://scripting.com/">my blog</a> if you want to say hi to me and others who read this blog. That's what it means. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/17.html#a200227" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Today imho, that's where journalism is at. It's not hard to do, but it's going to make journalism more competitive which is a good thing! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/17.html#a192829" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Journalism needs the kind of sensible overhaul that Spamberger is bringing to Congress (except I do not support replacing Pelosi, we're totally lucky to have her now).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/17.html#a195700" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

That means no more MSNBC. When Mueller indicts or Congress investigates, or if he resigns,  I'll be happy to watch. But I don't need any more on the depravity of El Orange. I know it all. And btw, so do you.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/17.html#a233808" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
