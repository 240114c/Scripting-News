<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a185846"></a>A couple of changes to how Likes work <a href="http://scripting.com/">here</a>. 1. On new posts, Likes are on by default. I can still turn them off on each post. 2. Instead of saying "8 Likes" it now just says 8. It's easier on the eyes, and maybe it's just a ping and not necessarily a like. We will still call them likes.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/22.html#a185846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
