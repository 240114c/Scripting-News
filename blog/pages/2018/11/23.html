Last year <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/23/onePersonShoots600.png">one person</a> shot over 600 people in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting">Las Vegas</a>.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a175604"></a>There's a new element, <a href="http://source.scripting.com/#1542988644000">source:likes</a> in the <a href="http://source.scripting.com/">source</a> namespace. It appears in the <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> for Scripting News. Feed readers can use the server URL to form a Like icon for each item that integrates with other feed readers. Perhaps the beginning of a way to build connections between people who read a blog via various feed readers. Updated the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes/blob/master/readme.md">docs</a> for my Likes server to include a third <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes#api-for-the-node-app">API</a> endpoint. I'm probably going to support this in River5 to complete the circle.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/23.html#a175604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a224025"></a>I fixed <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes">Likes</a> for titled items.

Her competence, coolness and good manners say everything I as an American would like to say to the world. She's young, but not too young. A liberal who presents as a moderate. Thoughtful. Doesn't shoot from the hip.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/23/205133.html#a205141" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a205228"></a>If she wins, my pick for Attorney General would be Stacey Abrams. Like Sessions, from the South, but the South of today, not the south of the 1940s. Let's use the Democratic majorities to pass some strong updates to the Voting Rights Act, as a first priority. No more of the funny bullshit the Repubs have been doing to game the system. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/23/205133.html#a205228" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

That way feed readers if they were so inclined, could hook up all the readers of my blog to my Likes system. We'd have a nice little network for Liking stuff <i>without Facebook</i> in the middle. I find this is a very nice soft way of finding out who's reading my blog. Everyone is opt-in on everything. People want this from their blogs (Dries <a href="https://twitter.com/Dries/status/1065592741458075650">mentioned</a> this yesterday) and everyone with a podcast wants to know who listened. The thing is to make it easy for people to share that bit of info, rather than extracting it without permission. It's the web way of doing tracking. I love this. Now if NPM would just <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1066024770762928129">get out</a> of the way. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/23/175550.html#a172449" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline"><a name="a174916"></a>I figured out what to do. I just copied the right file into the right spot in node_modules and voila it works. What a fucking egregious hack. The best kind. If NPM had worked as it was supposed to this is one of those IWTFT situations. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/23/175550.html#a174916" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
