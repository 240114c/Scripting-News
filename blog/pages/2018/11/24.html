The <a href="http://likes.scripting.com/">home page</a> of my Likes server now includes a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/24/topLikes.png">list</a> of the 10 most-liked posts. Yes, I know titles would be nice to have. Most of my posts don't have titles. Also released a new version of the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes">Likes server</a> with this feature included. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/24.html#a164459" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a195135"></a>People who say they know what Facebook should do. How could they. Nothing like it has ever existed. It’s a miracle that it works at all. This is what I think when critics profess to know what’s wrong and how to fix it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/24.html#a195135" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155515"></a>I waited for a weekend to try this experiment. I wanted to see what would happen if I <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/24/deletedFiles.png">nuked</a> the data folder on my main <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> installation. So that's what I did today. You'll see the effect anywhere one of my rivers appears. For example, this is what <a href="http://podcatch.com/">podcatch.com</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/24/podcatchHomePage.png">looks like</a> right now. Hopefully that will change when the next podcast shows up, and by Monday there should be a full complement. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/24.html#a155515" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="tweet" data-tweetId="1066342105012994048" data-tweetUserName="davewiner"><a name="a144355"></a>An idea for a New Year's resolution. At least once a day agree with someone. Not silently. Say "I agree with you." No qualification, not "I agree with you, but.." It's jarring at first, then liberating. And the responses will surprise you. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/24.html#a144355" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
