<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152005"></a>Scott Mace sent a pointer to <a href="https://blogtrottr.com/">Blogtrottr</a>, a service that hooks <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> up to email. I just set it up to send me the posts from Scripting News once daily. This is what I was asking about <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/26.html#a183652">yesterday</a>. Now let's see how it handles posts without <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/27/titleLessBlogPosts.png">titles</a>. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üöÄ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/27.html#a152005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a183437"></a>I <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> how <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes">Likes</a> is working. For example, I noticed that the post <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/27.html#a152005">above</a> that mentions Scott Mace had one Like. Guess who? <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/27/scottMaceLikes.png">Scott Mace</a>. Haha. See how that works. I actually was wondering if he saw it. This is a bit of culture/tech that works. I like where it's going. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/27.html#a183437" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Luckily there is still enough life left in <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> to get a bootstrap going. That was the most fun of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days">salad days</a> of blogging, I had the ability to boot up new protocols and formats. Not all of them worked, but some did. I love making new stuff up and seeing it take root. Maybe we can do it now that social media is morphing into something else. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/27.html#a183907" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a225541"></a>Something you don‚Äôt hear on the political talk circuit, yet ‚Äî Trump is much weaker after the election. All Repubs at all levels saw how toxic he is in the midterms. They have a problem coming up in the next election, when the Senate is up for grabs, not just the House.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/27.html#a225541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a035059"></a>BTW, the question of whether anyone is above the law has been answered. The current president has been breaking the law since he took office. He has not been arrested or prosecuted. So by any reasonable definition of the idea, he is above the law.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/27.html#a035059" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
