All the characters are interesting, the story keeps unfolding in interesting ways, the acting is superb, you really get involved in the story. Now starting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Sinner-Season-2/dp/B07FQ7RPKR">season 2</a> on Amazon, for $15. So far it's just as good as the first.  <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/29.html#a185059" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
