<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153951"></a>I had dinner last night at <a href="https://handynasty.net/uws/">Han Dynasty</a> on the Upper West Side. It was delicious. The place is huge, you could throw a big party there. I told my young companion that I want my funeral to be held there. The service was great. And every dish was wonderful. So tasty. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/30.html#a153951" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
