The Repubs are playing tricks to disempower the people of their states who voted for a change of government. They may succeed but the light should shine brightly on them, and people should not be allowed to forget. This is a party you can't elect without them turning on you. They <i>truly</i> are enemies of the people. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/02.html#a164937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a154016"></a>A new <a href="http://weblikes.org/">home page</a> to tie all this stuff together and a new domain, weblikes.org.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/02/154005.html#a154016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154134"></a>The first <a href="http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/client/">demo app</a> is nice, but it was complex. We needed a <a href="http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/helloworld/">Hello World app</a>, so now there is one. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples/helloWorld">Source</a> provided, of course. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/02/154005.html#a154134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154528"></a>Now that there are two example apps, the repository needed a new organization. There's now an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples">examples folder</a> at the top level, and the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/api">JavaScript API</a> is in its own folder. Code to include it must change as well. This is exemplified in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples">examples</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/02/154005.html#a154528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154735"></a>New options for the JavaScript API: 1. You can omit the word "likes," as we do on <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>, and 2. Have the Like bits appended instead of prepended. Check out <a href="https://github.com/scripting/likes/blob/master/examples/helloWorld/code.js">code</a> in the Hello World app to see how they're set.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/02/154005.html#a154735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155032"></a>Various CSS edits that allow the environment defaults to rule the rendering of Likes as opposed to having the values hard-coded in the CSS for likes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/02/154005.html#a155032" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a161258"></a>There were breaking changes in this release. if you've already deployed, sorry. I haven't heard from anyone who has. If you're depending on this toolkit, great.
