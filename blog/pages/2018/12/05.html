	<li><a name="a184030"></a>1:42PM Eastern: I've received several notes from users of <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a> that the app isn't responding. I looked into it and found that the server it's running on has a full disk. Log files overflowing. Still haven't got a systematic way to deal with that. I just removed all the old log files and now the server has a lot of free space. It'll take a few minutes for everything to come back online, hopefully. Will report here. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/05/184016.html#a184030" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a194515"></a>2:45PM: I think I have the server put back together after the outage. If you have any trouble running <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a> please <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/104">report it here</a>. If you can, open the JavaScript console and look for error messages in red and include what you see. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/05/184016.html#a194515" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
