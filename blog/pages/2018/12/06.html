<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a023219"></a>In the great <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spaces+vs+tabs+debate&t=h_&ia=web">spaces vs tabs debate</a>, as a programmer for over 40 years, I use neither. I program in an <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+an+outliner+site%3Ascripting.com&t=h_&ia=web">outliner</a>, a kind of editor that understands structure. The display of the structure is something the editor does for me. It doesn't use spaces or tabs.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/06.html#a023219" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Now with what the Repubs are <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-perspec-zorn-wisconsin-michigan-power-grab-lame-duck-kill-1207-20181206-story.html">doing</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/us/politics/michigan-republicans-power.html">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/04/politics/wisconsin-michigan-republican-post-election-power-grabs/index.html">Wisconsin</a>, I guess that needs updating. What do we have to do? This requires a new think.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/06.html#a151758" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144327"></a>People are so critical about how Facebook makes them feel. But that's just one part of it. If you work in a place by yourself, having FB or Twitter around is like having a water cooler to go take a break at. You reach a stopping point, you want to clear your head, so you go do something chatty for a bit. They work. If they didn't exist you'd have to invent them (which of course we did).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/06.html#a144327" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144604"></a>BTW, back in the old days we'd need a break (using a BBS or CompuServe, then and later AppleLink) because compilations took so long. It could be as much as ten minutes. Then builds got fast, then instantaneous. And of course now we have Dropbox which is sometimes as slow at syncing servers as the old compilers were at building an executable. Same as it ever was.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/06.html#a144604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a133957"></a>Today I'm going to build a Node app that finds out how much space is available on the system disk and writes the result to a location on S3. This will allow my <a href="https://github.com/scripting/serverMonitor">serverMonitor</a> app to periodically read those files and present them in a tabular form. I have to have an easy way to see if one of my servers has run out of space. Not sure exactly how I'm going to approach it. Update: Here's the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/freeDiskSpace/blob/master/freediskspace.js">code</a>. It only works on Unix. I send a command to the shell asking it to run the DF command, get the result, and write the stats to S3. serverMonitor has been updated to look for the files for the server, and it shows me a table with the percentage free space. Problem solved. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/06.html#a133957" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
