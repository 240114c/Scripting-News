Amazing connections on arriving. New concourse at Penn Station, very confusing. Followed one of the paths, was hoping to get on the 1 train uptown, but the concourse took me right to the platform for the A train. WTF. So I went upstairs, and as I was reaching the platform an uptown A pulls in. I get on. A seat is waiting for me. I get off the train, walk to my building and an elevator opens, I get in and it takes me right up to my apartment. From the Acela to my living room, about 10 minutes. Couldn't possibly have happened any faster. Sometimes, rarely, NYC "just works" as we say in the software biz. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/09.html#a001638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141827"></a>I saw <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/can-you-ever-forgive-me">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a> last night. It was as reviewed, excellent. Melissa McCarthy is a phenomenal actress, you get total suspension of disbelief, except for a few instants scattered throughout where they remind you she is one of the best comics of our day. The theme is self-knowledge. Running away from yourself until you can't, and that's when life begins. Must-see. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/09.html#a141827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
