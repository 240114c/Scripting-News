<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161245"></a>iOS 12 problem. On a phone call, after a few minutes the volume drops until I can't hear the other party. When I call back the volume goes back to normal.  Happens with several numbers, so it's on my end not theirs. New iPhone XS. Any <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1073238178910359555">help</a> appreciated.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/13.html#a161245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125859"></a>Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/12.html#a151840">asked</a> the braintrust of this blog to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/105">help me understand Kubernetes</a>. Turns out I did not understand it. You all are the smartest most generous people I know.

When I think of a movement I think of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">civil rights movement</a> of the 1960s, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement#Vietnam_War">anti-war movement</a> that protested the Vietnam war. I do not think The Correspondent which is a for-profit business deserves to use that term. I certainly do not like them saying that I am a member of such a "movement." As I said in my <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/11/131151.html">writeup</a>, "the only movement I would be part of is one that doesn't distinguish between reporters and members, that has a level playing field. I think that's the only way journalism can scale to meet our needs and avoid the kinds of disasters journalism has led us to." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/13.html#a130100" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
