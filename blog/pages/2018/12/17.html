<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/07/21/trumpHead.png"><a name="a012628"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/07/21/trumpHead.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I watched a bit of political news this evening. They say people are overloaded with news about Trump. I don't think that's what's really going on. Instead, Trump being a mobster is "priced-into" his public image. You all are just reporting the same story over and over. That gets boring. It is significant that he's a mob boss. The tragedy is that we can't seem to do anything about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/17.html#a012628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
