<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165840"></a>A <a href="https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/8">question</a> on the XML-RPC site about servers. How should they handle booleans. After almost 20 years since it first deployed, I have a practical answer. I also have a new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/xmlrpc.js">implementation</a>, in JavaScript, that can still be changed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/18.html#a165840" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182532"></a>The thing that I like about Facebook is that it theoretically gives me equal voice to Walt Mossberg. And to his credit, he often read things I wrote on Facebook. OTOH, when he quits FB it merits an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/walt-mossberg-quit-facebook.html">article</a> in the NYT. So he lives in a different media world than the rest of us.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/18.html#a182532" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So did Facebook and CNN, Fox and MSNBC. The NYT, the WP and Vanity Fair. All are making a fortune off it, but they aren't to blame, actually. They're just parasites. The disease is the idiocy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/18.html#a153753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But the jury and the defendant are the principals. Never forget that. If journalism is a civic act, it <i>must</i> involve the people in a similar way.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144747"></a>I thought this <a href="https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/825-8-Reasons-Python-Sucks.html">piece</a> about why Python sucks was interesting. I clicked on it because I always thought Python was a good language. Algol-like. And it had an idea similar to the one in Frontier that program structure doesn't require curly braces and semicolons. It's an insight that seems to have escaped most other language designers. Well, it turns out the #1 reason Python sucks for this guy is breakage. I never understood the idea that breakage was okay in "point versions." In practical terms, breakage is never okay. Never. With a little more thought and work, you can move forward compatibly, adding new features in a continuous fashion. I wasn't aware of how bad this was in Python. This is an idea that should be discussed at tech conferences. I even have a motto for it. Discontinuities suck.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143657"></a>Dear Facebook quitters who are in VC or who are writing books about tech... What happens when Facebook does something good or bad that you need to understand either for business or art? I’m a software dev and tech blogger, and I need my account because they are huge and going to be around for a while and I have to understand what they’re doing because like it or not they’re not going away.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/18.html#a143657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
