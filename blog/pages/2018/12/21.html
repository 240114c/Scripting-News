<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160502"></a>I just re-read the recent NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html">article</a> about Facebook and I couldn't find anything in the piece that wasn't a conclusion and stated in a way that left it unclear what actual permissions were given to Facebook's partner companies. They need to hire experts at the Times to at least provide parallel reporting so their claims can be evaluated by neutral experts at the same time they make the allegations. Someone must watch over the NYT the way they watch over Trump and Facebook. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/21.html#a160502" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
