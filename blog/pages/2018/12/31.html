Two main reasons. 1. It's inverted from a spam point of view. You comment in your Twitter flow. I get to read your comment because I follow the <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/comments/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/scriptingnews">#scriptingnews</a> tag. If I think what you said is valuable I can <i>like</i> it, or RT it or follow you. So there's a way for me to amplify your flow, but it's my choice. 2. Twitter's new 280-char limit works really well, as <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html">noted</a> earlier. It's enough to express an idea, but not enough to write a blog post. Perfect. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/31.html#a201619" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161956"></a>iTunes has been acting like an asshole today, refusing to copy files onto my iPhone. Had an idea. Can Dropbox on my iPhone play MP3s? It can. It's a way to avoid using iTunes to put podcasts on my iPhone. And they end up on all my devices. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/31.html#a161956" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Use the <i class="fa fa-retweet"></i> feature here on Scripting News more. It's a way to comment on what's going on here, without using Disqus (which in its latest iterations has become really offensive).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html#a154422" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a160029"></a>Twitter, with its 280 character limit is now a good commenting system wrt my <a href="http://guidelines.scripting.com/">Comment Guidelines</a>. Keep it short, provide a link, don't use comments to write blog posts.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html#a160029" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155238"></a>It's funny, I didn't write much about the comments feature when it came out on <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/16.html">12/16</a> and <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/17.html">subsequent</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/18.html">days</a>. I did start a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/106">thread</a> on the repo, but there isn't much there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html#a155238" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
