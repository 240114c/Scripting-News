<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a224256"></a>Why people like <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC">AOC</a> are so important -- she doesn't depend on the established news orgs to transmit what she says. She goes <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/03/19/theRebootOfJournalism.html">direct</a>. This was the <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html">goal</a> of blogging. And it's being achieved.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/07.html#a224256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161231"></a>Jay Rosen and I used to have a podcast entitled <a href="http://rebootnews.com">Rebooting the News</a>. Since then it's gotten worse, as Jay explains in this <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1082105442820595713">Twitter thread</a>. Today it needs more than a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/03/19/theRebootOfJournalism.html">reboot</a>. More like a tear-down and rebuild. Back in the podcast days I wasn't a believer in what they call "citizen journalism." Now I think it's the only thing that can save us. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/07.html#a161231" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/17/melo.png"><a name="a154454"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/17/melo.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Just listened to the <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">Brian Lehrer Show</a> discussing The Wall. They talk about it as if it's something that exists or is possible. As I understand it, we already have walls where ever it is practical. It's not possible to put a wall on a river, and much of the border between the US and Mexico is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande">Rio Grande</a>. You can't put a wall on the bank of a river. That's ridiculous. So I think before we have discussions about this thing that is supposedly possible, let's first address the question of whether it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/07.html#a154454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154242"></a>Every time I see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez">AOC</a> on TV I am so proud to be an American and a NYer. She is the future we deserve. Hopefully many young people will look to her as a role model, and will value intelligence, courage, education and their ability to make a difference. Now, we need journalism of that quality, because without it, politics can never really get out of the sewer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/07.html#a154242" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
