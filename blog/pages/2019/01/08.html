There already is a wall.  2. If you want to build something new, first tell us WTF it is because no one knows. I learned this from Leo McGarry on The West Wing. Don't accept the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/08/hillaryGoToWestWingDebatePrepSchool.html">premise</a> of the question. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/08.html#a005243" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a153517"></a>The browser is an editor.

	<li><a name="a153644"></a>The net result is you can build higher castles of functionality because so many details are handled by the platform. Errors stand out sooner.

	<li><a name="a154454"></a>One of my development projects was stored in the wrong location on S3. I didn't realize it until I had to type the address in a different context. You see things on S3 through an awkward jumble of inconsistent commands. In Frontier you see your data, and interact with expand, collapse, point and click, drag and drop. Not new ideas. But S3 doesn't use them. They're there for a reason, to make work faster and help you spot errors faster. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/08/153359.html#a154454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
