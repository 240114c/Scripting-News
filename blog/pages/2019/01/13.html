We lost but <a href="https://theknickswall.com/knox-scores-career-high-knicks-fall-sixers-thriller-recap/">came close</a> at the end. In NY we call this a moral victory. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/13.html#a213131" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a215228"></a>Journalism and politics must both be reformed around reality, you can't have one without the other. We need an <a href="https://indivisible.org/">Indivisible</a> for journalism. We already have the tech, we just need the will.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/13.html#a215228" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Until then I hadn't thought about it much, because the web was barely used for commerce; there were no massive social networks. This was before all that. Now many years later, I understand the problem well, I've lived it, so far without much cost. There's a huge societal vulnerability because we don't have control of identity for many important things, like banking, loans, all kinds of property ownership, as well as the social risks. But because money is so central to identity, it's surprising that there isn't a Google or Amazon of identity. Seems there's money to be made here. An organization with physical branches everywhere, with people in them who can help with indentity problems. Starbucks would have a good start. Amazon, Google and Apple probably have plans for it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/13.html#a154356" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155455"></a>Starbucks also seems well-positioned to be a cannabis retailer. It's the perfect environment to buy and consume. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/13.html#a155455" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
