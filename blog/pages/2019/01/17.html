So the elite in the US want to get good at building walls. I doubt if they care about the southern border of the US though. They're all building estates in New Zealand, as far away from the fallout as they can get. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/17.html#a173805" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a173604"></a>The 100 most important technologies according to <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/technology-ranked-1830501100">Gizmodo</a>. I think anesthesia is much more important than #85, for example. An interesting conversation-starter.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/17.html#a173604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm just deleting a folder and creating a new one. Every time I go into edit mode on S3 I realize how much time we spend there and how crude the tools are. There must be a million people who maintain data on S3. Why not invest in some great tools for us Amazon? And just think if they were user-level tools, how many more people could benefit from reliable, inexpensive, app-accessible cloud storage. What an advantage they have, and what an opportunity for a competitor. This isn't theoretical, I've created an <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/08/153359.html">object store</a> with much better user access than S3, many years ago. Nothing speculative. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/17.html#a154620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We're approaching February, then before you know it it'll be March, and you know what comes next -- April. After that we start getting ready for summer, and then Halloween and The Holidays, and another year in the bag. That's life folks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/17.html#a153617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
