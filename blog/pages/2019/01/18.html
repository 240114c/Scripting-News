<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152004"></a>Thanks to all the people who <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/02/154005.html">Like</a> my posts here. I always look to see who's checking in. True story. A friend was talking, face-to-face, about one of my podcasts. I asked why he didn't Like it. He said he did. I checked later, and sure enough he had Liked it. Ever since I've been checking them every day, sometimes more than once. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/18.html#a152004" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
