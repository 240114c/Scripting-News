<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a215717"></a>It is <i>wicked</i> <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/21/brrrr.png">cold</a> out there. Just took a 40-minute walk in the elements, and by the end the cold had gotten through all my layers. My core was getting cold. Can't remember that ever happening. (Actually the first few nights I was in Madison were like that. Then I learned how to dress in sub-zero weather.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/21.html#a215717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I wrote it up <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/20/185927.html">here</a>. It consists of 5815 pages like <a href="http://scripting.com/flickr/00372.html">this</a>.

Seattle's amazing public <a href="http://scripting.com/flickr/02859.html">library</a>. And much more. Use the Random button to find a good place, and then hit Prev to find the beginning of the sequence, and step through them with the Next button. I added a link to the Scripting News page for the day the photo was taken. Often there's a connection between what I posted on Flickr and what I posted on my blog. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/21.html#a150821" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
