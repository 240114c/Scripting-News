<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180410"></a>One thing people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/opinion/sunday/steve-jobs-never-wanted-us-to-use-our-iphones-like-this.html">don't understand</a> about Steve Jobs is that he never sold a product he didn't have. At rollout, the iPhone couldn't run apps. So at rollout it he didn't talk about them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/25.html#a180410" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182355"></a>Another thing most people don't get. Developing platforms even before you roll them out, takes a lot of time. People think about platforms as if you could imagine a movie like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)">Titanic</a> one day, and have it in the theaters in a month or two. Platforms take time.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/25.html#a182355" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It might help the libertarians in Congress understand that government actually serves a purpose.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/25.html#a155322" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
