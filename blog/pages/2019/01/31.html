<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a164041"></a>I'm rewatching The Sopranos. The first few seasons were uneven, but by the end of Season 5 it was great. The last two episodes were magnificent. Dramatic, moving, with a lot of comedy (I hadn't remembered how many laughs there were in the show). Outstanding characters. The best writing. Virtuoso acting.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/31.html#a164041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

"If, however, [the country] would like someone to lead a fatigued nation in a long exhale, it can pick a Minnesotan, at last." It's observable that every president fixes the big problem with the previous president. Carter was a saint to follow Nixon's evil. Reagan projected strength to Carter's ineffectiveness. The next president, for sure a Democrat, will allow us to forget DC politics for a while and tend to other pressing business.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/31.html#a163256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
