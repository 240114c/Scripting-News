<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a205648"></a>I ran a script that fixed all the <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/204408.html">broken links</a> to radio.weblogs.com on blog pages on scripting.com. I got tired of all the broken images. Here's a <a href="http://this.how/radioWeblogsPages/">list of the pages</a>, and a <a href="http://scripting.com/misc/scriptingOriginalFiles.zip">zip archive</a> of the original versions of the pages, as a backup in case anything went wrong.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/10.html#a205648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm using a number of car-rating sites, including <a href="http://consumerreports.org">Consumer Reports</a> where I am a member. I wanted to use their <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-prices-build-buy-service/index.htm?ep=A37">pricing service</a>, but they ask for a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/02/10/whatsYourPhoneNumber.png">phone number</a> before letting you in. This was a deal-stopper at first, but eventually I relented and entered my number. Immediately I was taken to a screen that said that a dealer would contact me <i>by phone. </i>No opt out. I was not warned this would happen. I assumed that because this was <a href="https://carbuying.consumerreports.org/register/?exteriorColorId=952534&viprMakeId=60&viprMakeName=Subaru&viprModelId=8219&viprStyleId=63359">integrated</a> with Consumer Reports website that it would treat me, the consumer, fairly. I just got a call from the dealer. I didn't take it. A waste of all our time, but most importantly a waste of CR's rep. They took a big hit here with me. Which sucks because trust is central to the service they sell. [Update: It's turning into a spamfest. The dealer, <a href="https://www.berterasubaru.com/">Bertera Subaru</a>, has called twice, sent three text messages and two emails, so far. Another update. When I asked Andrew Luzio of Bertera to stop spamming me, he responded with <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/02/10/moreSpamFromBertera.png">more spam</a>.]<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/10.html#a163049" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
