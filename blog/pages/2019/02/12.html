Medium is a "level playing field" platform where anyone can post and they're <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/medium-acquires-bold-italic/">mixing in</a> professional stuff. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/12.html#a195135" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a195356"></a>However, Medium hasn't been clear about the professional stuff and they should be. There are cases of paid-for pieces that appear to be free submissions. They're buying endorsements without being clear that's they're paid-for. The writers should insist, it doesn't look good for them either. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/12.html#a195356" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In hindsight, would it have been better to ignore Craig's List in the 90s, or should at least some of you competed?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/12.html#a194636" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
