No product is everything to everyone, a lesson learned when integration was a huge push in the software business. A better approach is to use Twitter tech to glue together a variety of apps, each with their focus on one aspect of networked communication and publishing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/15.html#a145635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
