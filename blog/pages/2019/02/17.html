<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a043138"></a>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Looming_Tower_(miniseries)">Looming Tower</a> on Hulu. Very nice. Alec Baldwin plays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tenet">George Tenet</a>, head of the CIA. Interesting to see that a good part of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vQlhWBvAwY">Donald Trump</a> imitation is actually Alec Baldwin being himself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/17.html#a043138" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a164844"></a>I have an Electron app that I use every day. Something I wrote for myself. It runs fine, perfectly fast, the performance monitor doesn't indicate any problems. But if I don't reload the app every morning then it gets really slow. I thought I knew the reason, but then I fixed it and it still needs a reload. So maybe Electron isn't perfect, but it's a very good idea, and very useful. A combination of Chrome and Node. I've invested a lot of time in taming the programming model, so I don't want to hear about how Electron is like Flash. But if you think it's too slow, don't trash it, roll up your sleeves and figure out why and submit a bug report. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/17.html#a164844" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Most of what passes for discourse is thinly disguised spam.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/17.html#a164749" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
