If journalism is about democracy, then the role it has for citizens is too limited. Give us money. We have so much more to give. Approx 6 minutes.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/21.html#a181121" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We don't think we can do anything to change, so we don't do anything.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/21/173344.html#a173351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a173627"></a>Bottom line -- paying $100 a year to the NYT doesn't do it for me. I have to do more. And the NYT is totally part of the problem. They do actually post a lot of fake news. It's so screwed up that Trump actually is right about this. I'm not saying the Times can or should change, I don't think they can. But I also don't accept that all I can do is sit on the sidelines and watch the world descend deeper into the abyss. These conferences tend to generate their own reality, as does the news industry. Problem is that reality is getting further and further from what's actually happening. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/21/173344.html#a173627" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a174637"></a><a href="http://timothysnyder.org/">Timothy Snyder</a> has good advice about this. Invest in local news. And btw, I have a lot more to invest than money. We have to get more going here than us giving money to reporters who don't listen to us. That's basically the answer the news industry has for me. Give us money. Well you have to do better than that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/21/173344.html#a174637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a145944"></a>This is an interesting idea. Not sure I'd go for it. But Twitter might have the Netflix-for-News platform.

	<li><a name="a145728"></a>Dennis Kennedy: "I try not to retweet links to articles that are on paywall or subscription sites, or that I know will run a reader through an ad maze to try to read the article. I, too, wish an automatic marking of these kinds of sites was a feature on Twitter." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/21/145641.html#a145728" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I post links to NYT stories, knowing I might be costing people some of their free stories.
