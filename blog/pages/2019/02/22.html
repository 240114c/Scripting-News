I know, too much information. I was chasing a woman who stole my heart 20-plus years ago and as then, I got her. It was truly delicious, and the memories are vivid. She's long gone but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcATvu5f9vE">dream</a> is still there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/22.html#a151650" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was about to ask people what their first car was, but then realized this is often a "security" question.
