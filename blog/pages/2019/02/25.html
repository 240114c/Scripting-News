<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a164720"></a>The best speeches in last night's Oscars were the actors, which should not be a surprise. This is what they do. They're playing a role, they've probably been coached by experts. Look at the boost <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy4GL6RtVOk">Malik</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy8z_Tq_VHo">Colman</a> got. They go from being small-time stars, to big stars overnight. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/25.html#a164720" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a164134"></a>With all the high stakes drama in the world the news should at least be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times">interesting</a>. But it isn't. Another sign something isn't working. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/25.html#a164134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154332"></a>I've come to think of Twitter and YouTube as integral parts of my blog. I am able to include tweets and YT videos as expandable elements under a blog item. If either system were to go down, the posts would still be readable, I try to write them so they'll still make sense. But there's no question at least these two systems have become integral to the web as I see and use it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/25.html#a154332" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The people are relegated to paying to read. Seems like a pretty basic flaw. And they want taxpayer funding. Hmmm. Didnâ€™t we fight a revolution over just that?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/25.html#a154141" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a155156"></a>I also would have posted it to the NYT site and the New Yorker and Wired and any other news site that allowed source postings. None do. I believe that if news is to right itself and get on a strong foundation on the web, this will seem like a silly idea in the future.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/02/25/155035.html#a155156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
