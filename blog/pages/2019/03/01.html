<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a205913"></a>Adweek is a sneaky outfit. If you go there with an ad blocker on you get <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/01/adweek.png">this scolding</a>. So if you turn the ad blocker off, you still can't read the article. This is supposed to make you do what? Subscribe? Not really, I wonder if they user-tested this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/01.html#a205913" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153133"></a>Over on Twitter, a question -- "What do you do to feel more confident?" I have an answer, but it's sort of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NSFW">NSFW</a>. So I'll post it here instead of there. Certain drugs in  your bloodstream give you confidence. Not sure if this is true for women, but it is true for me, and I'd guess for other men. So when I'm feeling frail, or sad, or lacking direction, I stimulate my body to produce this drug. It's never failed. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/01.html#a153133" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a205727"></a>Here's the thing I don't understand. How can you buy furniture online? I can't get a feel for it. This little couch is very cheap. It must feel cheap, right? But it doesn't <i>look</i> cheap.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/01/205637.html#a205727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
