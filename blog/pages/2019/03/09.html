<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a181343"></a>Yesterday I bought a house to go with my new car. (Heh actually it's the other way around.) It's a beautiful house in upstate New York, in the Catskills. It's a place where old hippies go when they want to get an advance look at heaven. I was looking for six months, considered a lot of options, and went for a place that's a bit daring, not conservative, that's what I always seem to do. As you might imagine, I'll have much more to share in the coming weeks and months. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/09.html#a181343" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a181628"></a>I appreciate what Elizabeth Warren is proposing re tech companies. But we need to do more, and do it very soon. They are destroying natural resources the way oil giants did before the government stepped in. However our political leaders, like most users, donâ€™t understand.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/09/181601.html#a181628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a181647"></a>The natural resource they are destroying is the World Wide Web, an open, unowned resource that has fostered the innovative environment that gave birth to Google and Facebook.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/09/181601.html#a181647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a181657"></a>Google is acting as if it were the government, without any checks and balances, no oversight, no redress of grievances. They say theyâ€™re doing it for the good of the net, but we know theyâ€™re a huge corporation, and thatâ€™s not how it works.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/09/181601.html#a181657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a181708"></a>Facebook is sucking the life out of the web, along with Medium (where Warren published her manifesto!). Some simple rules, if followed, would restore balance to the web ecosystem. But there are no rules here, so they run wild, and take whatever isnâ€™t nailed down.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/09/181601.html#a181708" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a181722"></a>Theyâ€™ve had a fantastic run, but itâ€™s long past time for some rules, and consequences for not respecting that we all have ownership of the resource they are foreclosing on.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/09/181601.html#a181722" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
