<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a171157"></a>Fixed a bug in <a href="http://feedbase.io/">feedBase</a> where if you upload an OPML file to a newly created account, it would lose track of its address. The <i>View my OPML</i> command in the Main menu would be disabled. It now works as it was supposed to. âœ“<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16.html#a171157" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I like that it's encrypted, and that it's open source. I'm not feeding Mark Zuckerberg. That's a plus. But today it's not working on my Mac desktop. When I launch the app it gets stuck in a loop saying it's <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/16/optimizingApplication.png">optimizing</a> the application. There is a <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/2581">thread</a> on the GitHub project about this, but the fixes are expressed in terms of a beta, which I don't think I'm running. According to the About window I'm running <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/16/signalAbout.png">v1.22.0</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16.html#a132633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165315"></a>Ken Sedgwick from Berkeley: "Recently I became aware of <a href="https://keybase.io/">keybase</a>.  It is also open source and end-to-end encrypted.  It adds some really nice features authenticating your identity on twitter, github, reddit, http etc.  It also has encrypted groups with file sharing etc."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16.html#a165315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I think there are some valid approaches. Including <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1106694336215990272">this</a> from a thread on Twitter yesterday. "Let's talk about it. I think it involves patents and trademarks. And the equivalent of the GPL for intellectual property. Prevent open shared creations from being used in silos. <i>You can't import what you won't export.</i> Something like that."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16.html#a134122" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We had a rule that every desk had to have a PC on it, which was somewhat radical for the 80s. That included our receptionist, Tammy, who was like my officemate, since my room was adjacent to the front entrance. We put a Toshiba desktop on the table next to her desk, and put a copy of ThinkTank on it, for notetaking, but she never used it. That was allowed too, the computer just had to be there. turned on and ready to go. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16/184638.html#a184646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a184806"></a>One day we got a confidential demo of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General-One">new product</a> from Data General, the first battery powered PC-compatible laptop. This was a huge deal. I brought groups of all the employees in to show it to them, including of course Tammy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16/184638.html#a184806" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a184836"></a>When she saw it she said "I would use that computer." I was puzzled. "But Tammy that computer does exactly what your Toshiba does." She replied, but it doesn't have all those wires. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16/184638.html#a184836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a184927"></a>I learned something memorable there. People find computers intimidating because of all the wires. I don't blame them, I would too. That's the great thing about iPhones I guess. No wires.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16/184638.html#a184927" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a184927"></a>PS: While we were testing the DG/One we were also testing the first Macintosh. Both used 3.5 inch floppy drives. But the formats weren't compatible. I tried to communicate to both companies, without violating the others' NDA that there was an opportunity to be compatible, but neither were interested. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/16/184638.html#a184927" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
