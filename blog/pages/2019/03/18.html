<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a020707"></a>Note to self: A freshly set up Mac has weird mouse behavior. It scrolls when you move the mouse pointer, sometimes. This is how you disable it. In the Accessibility prefs panel, click on <i>Mouse & Trackpad,</i> then <i>Mouse Options, </i>then <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/18/mousePref.png">uncheck</a> the Scrolling popup. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/18.html#a020707" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

First they had interviews with victims, then quoted the prime minister about gun control and they ended with a broad trashing of the net, specifically YouTube and Facebook. But they omit a very <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=salient">salient</a> fact about the economics of running an open content publishing platform. You can't review each video in advance, there are too many videos and employees are too expensive. There are shades of gray, but for the NYT it's black and white. Further the reporters have a huge undisclosed conflict of interest, because the net is used for more than terrorism, it's <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/06/170723.html">sources going direct</a> to interested readers. There's a new news system trying to boot up. The same features of the net that make it possible to bootstrap a terrorism network, also enable new channels of news. But <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/30/salary/">of course</a> this is never part of their discussion. They make it sound easy. Tech is bad. Tech is responsible. Implied but not said: shut it down. They are as scary as the terrorists. Think about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/18.html#a004737" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a022341"></a>It's way too early for a 2020 presidential horse race. I'd like to uncheck that box. Oh that's right, there are no topic <a href="http://scripting.com/futureNews.html">checkboxes</a> on Twitter. Somehow my car can steer itself, but Twitter can't tell a post is about horserace politics.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/18.html#a022341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a011211"></a>Journalism used to vilify Craig Newmark, then he started <a href="https://craignewmarkphilanthropies.org/">giving millions</a> to news think tanks, journalism schools, and startup news orgs.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134915"></a>I decided to try <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/pantry/info?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=223646217010&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15591104968288053328&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_7z63e8sfm8_b&hvtargid=kwd-315558576224">Amazon Pantry</a>, since I'm now living in a place where FreshDirect doesn't deliver. I just got a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/18/soup.png">notice</a> that "Progresso Soup" has shipped. I ordered five different kinds of Progresso soup, wanting to try them all. I prayed that the title of the order was just one of the items they were shipping. Nope. One can of Progresso soup will arrive in its own Amazon box on Wednesday. I can see this will be a short-lived experiment. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/18.html#a134915" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
