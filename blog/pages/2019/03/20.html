Developer tool developers should be so concerned about the cost of re-training. Lots to process for techies. I listened to the podcast driving down the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway">NYS Thruway</a> in my Forester that <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/17.html#a035213">nudges</a> you to stay in your lane. I always think, what if there's a bug in this system, it might make my car do something like what the Boeing planes were doing. But I leave it on, because I like what it's doing, at least for now.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/20.html#a183936" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a142423"></a>The new country house has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_heat_pump">geothermal heating and cooling</a>, which is something I didn't know existed until I found this house. It's supposed to be a lot less expensive. It uses electricity to move water around to transfer heat from or to a pool of underground water that's at a constant temperature of 55 degrees. In the summer, it's used to cool, in the winter to heat. Genius.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/20/142118.html#a142423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142236"></a>But just before the heat comes on it makes a very loud jarring sound, like a garage door slamming shut. It rocks the whole house. Wakes me up when I'm sleeping. There's no preparation for it, it just happens. It's basically not acceptable. I don't want to get used to it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/20/142118.html#a142236" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I've tried searching on the net for ideas about how noisy these things are supposed to be, and no one talks about this loud sound.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/20/142118.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I have to find someone to come out and take a look, but I don't know how to search for someone who does maintenance on geothermal heating.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/20/142118.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I love the idea, but this is not an acceptable situation. I may have to switch to conventional heating and cooling.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/20/142118.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142330"></a>PS: An AirBnB I rented the week before had the same problem. It was worse because the heat was going on and off all the time. So it was garage door slamming all night nonstop. Needless to say I didn't stay there the full time I had reserved it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/20/142118.html#a142330" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
