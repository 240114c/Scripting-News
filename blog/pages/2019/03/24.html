The rest of MSNBC tries to cover every story as if it's a horse race. Trump's corruption doesn't fit the horse race model very well, hence they are failing. I assume CNN is the same.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/24.html#a235635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/24/trickyDick.png"><a name="a000502"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/24/trickyDick.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">From what I hear on MSNBC, we have no idea what the Mueller report says. We only know what Barr says the report says. Reminds me of a Watergate story. Nixon didn't want to release the tapes because they would incriminate him. So he got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Stennis">Democratic senator</a> from the south who mostly voted Republican to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stennis_Compromise">listen</a> to the tapes, and he came out and said basically Nixon is right, nothing criminal here. It didn't work. The tapes ultimately were released. The more the Repubs don't want the Mueller report released, the more it says it <i>must</i> be released. No one is going to give up on this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/24.html#a000502" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If the user logs off, changes their Twitter username, then logs back into the app, the updates will go to the old username. This was a caching issue in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/twitter">davetwitter</a> package. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vincode-io">vincode-io</a> for the excellent detective work and <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedBase/issues/40">report</a>. I was able to understand the problem immediately, and it was easy to fix. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/24.html#a164643" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165908"></a>Independent of whether Congress impeaches, it would be great to have a public resource that listed all of Trump's clearly impeachable offenses, with Clinton's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton">1998 impeachment</a> as the benchmark.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/24.html#a165908" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When I was a math student, I got interested in graph theory, and wrote all kinds of Fortran apps that walked graphs, figuring out things about them. Not a great choice of language for that. Graph theory is part of at least two branches of math, combinatorics and topology. And I think there must be a mapping from topology to the structure of online communication systems. Looked at a particular way, we've been spending the whole of my career in tech, dating back to the 70s, studying, without any sense of the theory, the topology of net communication systems. Blogs are very different from mail lists, so different the could be considered opposites. List all the different rules for each of the following: Facebook groups, Facebook messages, public Twitter, Twitter DMs, Instagram, Snapchat, AppleLink, Reddit, Whatsapp, on and on. And the tools we use for managing developer groups also yield different kinds of social topology. I was just thinking about the difference between Slack and GitHub as two recent examples of development systems I've used. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/24.html#a152409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Cronkite's observation, that the war was unwinnable, turned press coverage in a different direction. The question of whether or not we should be in Vietnam was now something they could ask, and did.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/24/183722.html#a183737" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
