Here's the main idea. Users should be able to subscribe to OPML lists, not just import them. So I could use a different editor, or discovery mechanism, or who-knows-what to manage (some of) my subscription lists. Or use two different readers and have them share their lists. Having this architecture widely supported in the feed reader market would open up possibilities for higher level applications. It's a major upgrade for the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> market, something a silo can't match, without ceasing to be a silo. The challenge of open networks is that they leverage their openness. This is a remarkably easy feature for feed readers to support. I've implemented it in every feed reader I've written since 2002. It never takes more than a couple of days. If you're committed to <i>no lock-in</i> you should be all over this feature.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161656"></a>I've been peripherally aware that some browsers and operating systems support the idea of a <i>feed:</i> prefix for web addresses. However I don't know the history, where the idea originated, or how widely it is supported, and what are its intended semantics? When the user clicks on a link like <a href="feed:http://scripting.com/rss.xml">this</a> on a Mac, what's supposed to happen? This came up in a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedBase/issues/43#issuecomment-476272480">thread</a> on feedBase work.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/25.html#a161656" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But the seller says I’ll read the inspection report for you, then writes a summary that says the house doesn’t have termites (even though you can see it does) and it might have a leaky roof.
