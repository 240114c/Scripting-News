I will write more about it myself, I assume. I've been working on my move to <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/09.html#a181343">the country</a> for the last 24 hours so I've only had time to tweet about this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/28/203444.html#a203455" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a203606"></a>In this post I'll link to the tweets and to the posts I wrote during the <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/12/">maximum hype</a> over The Correspondent. I didn't care where their office was. I did object to them claiming to be revolutionary, because I didn't see any evidence of that. I come from the tech industry which indulged in this kind of hype many many times, and fortunes were made, a lot more than $2.7 million, over less than what The Correspondent had. I had high hopes for them, and in the end when I saw the plan I saw that they either didn't understand, or they punted and decided to do something pretty normal, but to hype it as if it were remarkable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/28/203444.html#a203606" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Especially appropriate since today is opening day, and the Mets won, with hits by a <a href="https://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/mets/robinson-cano-home-run-mets-first-at-bat-1.29079705">former Yankee</a> if you can believe that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/28/203444.html#a210036" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a210113"></a>Journalism has yet to win the World Series in the new world. The people who write about journalism today don't have a feel for what's possible. They're roaming around in the dark looking for inspiration, but they don't seem to know what questions to ask.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/28/203444.html#a210113" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a210201"></a>The Correspondent was a softball. Easy to figure out. Yet they all took the easy way out and just repurposed the hype. I believe they believed it. But they have to toughen up if they want to make it to the championship series. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/28/203444.html#a210201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
