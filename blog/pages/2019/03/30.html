I had never been able to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop">AirDrop</a> to work, but recently I became incentivized to figure it out. Now I'm using it for all kinds of things. In my experience it doesn't "just work," but once you get it working, it's very useful. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/30.html#a145955" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145325"></a>I just read a piece on Gizmodo saying that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/rss-is-better-than-twitter-1833624929">RSS is better than Twitter</a>. Then I had a thought, why not turn Twitter into an RSS reader. It's not too many steps. Accept an OPML subscription list. When you add a feed, call <a href="https://ifttt.com/"><span style="font-size: .95em">IFTTT</span></a> and say "map the output of this feed onto this Twitter account." When a feed disappears from the list, delete the IFTTT script. I'm not sure if IFTTT's API will let you do this. OTOH you could probably set up a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> installation to do it, but it'd be more work. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/30.html#a145325" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
