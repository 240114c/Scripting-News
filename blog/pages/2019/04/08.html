<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="tweet" data-tweetId="1115239756974174208" data-tweetUserName="davewiner"><a name="a130622"></a>When I sit down at a lovely dinner, with interesting, humor-filled friends in a beautiful spot, I am as rich as I can possibly be. A billionaire couldn't have more.  I first realized this at a sushi restaurant in Sausilito, where the chef had prepared the most amazing looking and tasting bouquet of fresh fish and rice. Literally this is as rich as you can get. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/08.html#a130622" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They keep changing these things. Once I had the speakers hooked up, I turned it on and it says INITIAL SETUP ON TV. I had no idea what it meant. So I sat down and thought. Hmm. Try hooking up an HDMI cable to the receiver's HDMI-out connection and into one of the HDMI ports on the TV. Reboot the receiver. Voila. There's a cheesy setup screen. I go through the first few pages, give it access to the net (probably a bad idea, even though I told it not to send data about me back to Japan). Then we got to ARC. I have no idea what this is. It said Your TV does not support ARC. I couldn't believe it because I have a new 4K highly recommended TV. Looked at their docs, which are better than the receiver's. I learn <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/what-is-audio-return-channel-arc/">ARC lets HDMI</a> sound flow back, out of the TV. Ahhh. No need for the optical cable I bought (glad, because it was hard to get it working with the TV). Once I told the TV I didn't have a subwoofer, the sound became incredible, I guess because it started sending the low notes to the big speakers I have. I will of course eventually get a subwoofer and rear speakers. But right now I'm glad I figured out what a receiver is in 2019. Very different from the receivers of my youth.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/08/183907.html#a183911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
