<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144056"></a>I'm going to Austin tomorrow, and thought I should have a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/04/10/austinWeather.png">look</a> at the <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=30.2676&lon=-97.743#.XK4AQRNKiX0">weather</a>. The first words that emitted from my mouth were <i>Holy Shit.</i> I'm not ready for a high of 91 (today) and only 81 on Thursday and Friday. In other news this will be my first flight from Albany via <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=41.8843&lon=-87.6324#.XK4ByBNKiX0">Chicago</a>, where there is a "significant winter storm" expected. I am totally not ready for this. What a crazy situation. I'm going through all this to talk for 45 minutes on Saturday? Probably a bunch of schmoozing too. I think I'm getting too old for this! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/10.html#a144056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
