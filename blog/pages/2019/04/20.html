	<li><a name="a151205"></a>And BTW, what restraints would there be on the next president? Maybe not such a buffoon as Trump. If we don't impeach and remove, we no longer have a Constitution that's enforced re the president. This guy has been ignoring it. We would all be ignoring it if he isn't impeached and removed.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/20/151133.html#a151205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a172507"></a>One implication of this is that all the other DoJ cases that are open now, will soon be closed. It's within his power to close them. So if you're thinking about SDNY cases, forget it. They're not going to happen.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/20/151133.html#a172507" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a172512"></a>The only thing the people control now is the House. Are we going to let the Democrats make this a partisan thing? If you're an independent, now's the time to express that independence. You shouldn't care if a Democrat gets re-elected, if they're just as corrupt at the Repubs.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/20/151133.html#a172512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a175332"></a>Trump's corruption is a moving target. He's found new people who go along with his most wantonly destructive acts, so the future offenses will be worse than the ones we're reviewing now.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/20/151133.html#a175332" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
