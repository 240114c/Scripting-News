I hope you are too." This ought to be our mantra. Disagreement is great. Suicide is not permitted.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/25.html#a214653" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a211649"></a>Another problem in letting the silos usurp the name "podcast" is they will take it places that suit them, and when it's done, the term will mean "failed get-rich-quick scheme."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/25.html#a211649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a003813"></a>Once podcasting becomes a tech battleground, it will get to be like Disneyland or HBO. I like silos as much as anyone, I prefer Fresca to some unknown local brand of soda (are there any?) but what I love about podcasting is the mix of styles and ideas. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/25.html#a003813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I have already given $100 to <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/11/23/205133.html">Amy Klobuchar</a>. I am really starting to like Elizabeth Warren. I like the confidence. But whatever happens I'm voting for whoever isn't Trump. I hope you are too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/25.html#a174258" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153734"></a>BTW, if you've ever watched Jeopardy, you should watch at least one of the current shows with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/arts/jeopardy-james-holzhauer-interview.html">James Holzhauer</a>. He's basically found a new level in the game. He is very knowledgable of trivia, but also risks a lot. And that's why he wins.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/25.html#a153734" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
