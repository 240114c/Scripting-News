<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a201908"></a>A browser JavaScript challenge. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/playingcards/">demo app</a>. Use the up and down arrow keys to move from card to card. When you get to the bottom of the screen the cursor moves to an object that is not visible. I want to scroll the window vertically to make the cursor object fully visible. If you look at <a href="http://scripting.com/playingcards/code.js">the code</a>, you'll see a routine named  <i>scrollToMakeVisible. </i>The goal is to fill in the body of that routine. I've opened a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/116">thread</a> to discuss. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/06.html#a201908" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It means an end to co-equal branches. It's a license for the executive to do whatever it wants. I wonder if people who think there's a good outcome possible from non-impeachment have thought this through. Trump may or may not be a bumbling fool with evil intent. But it's not hard to imagine a more competent fascist taking his place, and then what.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/06.html#a185523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161257"></a>I tried cross-posting but it doesn't work. I <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/04/endingAnExperiment.html">wrote</a> it up. The problem is that the silos don't support cross-posting in any direction. They really want to be worlds unto themselves. The web, as far as they're concerned, isn't worth supporting, even though they couldn't exist without it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/06.html#a161257" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
