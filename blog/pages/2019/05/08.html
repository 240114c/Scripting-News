Elizabeth Warren said it so <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/05/07/warren_defends_call_to_impeach_trump_no_political_convenience_exception_to_the_constitution.html">clearly</a> last night on MSNBC. Our moment of compromise will come when we are forced to take a loyalty oath to Trump. You may be sure you won't do it, but in the moment you will have a conundrum as to whether or not you sign the pledge.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/08.html#a154123" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150832"></a>New <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=chat">chat</a> feature. Ted posted a chat message yesterday that I didn't see for many hours. Not good. Disqus used to send me an email message when a new comment is posted. So I added that feature here. I now get an email when a message is posted. So I should be responding more quickly, if I have a response that is. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/08.html#a150832" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135906"></a><i>Meddled</i> is the wrong word for what the Russians did to the 2016 election. The proper word is hacked. The Russians hacked the 2016 election. I'm a longtime software developer and know what hacking is. This was hacking.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/08.html#a135906" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He's very persuasive and of course I totally agree. Now the Dems have been wrong too, also for decades, about not standing up to the Repubs breaking our system of government. At <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-obama-wall-street-torture.html">every step</a> they choose to ignore and overlook instead of investigating and fighting. It happened regarding torture in Iraq, the financial crisis, the Merrick Garland nomination, etc. It'd be interesting if Krugman could write one of his famous pieces about the Dems. Repubs aren't listening to him, but Democrats are. There is no option now but to stand up for the Constitution, or there will be no election to win in 2020. They can't put it off any longer, this is the end of Congress if they don't. Someone outside of government who people listen to, needs to say this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/08.html#a134806" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Every time I tune in <a href="https://www.wamc.org/topic/alan-chartock-message-president">Alan Chartock</a> is talking. He's their expert on everything, but all he says are platitudes. The first time he got my ire up he said "Everyone knows that X" and it pissed me off because X is not true (imho). He likes Joe Biden and Israel. He talks and talks and no one interrupts him, no wonder -- he owns the station (or so it seems).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/08/124434.html#a124457" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

There was a small army of his children in NYC. Not sure if it was based on a true story.
