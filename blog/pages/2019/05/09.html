We'd go up there <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Flushing,+Queens,+NY/Great+Barrington,+Massachusetts/@41.4865615,-74.1485058,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c260054dc0633f:0xfaec24d1b474281e!2m2!1d-73.833079!2d40.7674987!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e6d20ba5c5f965:0xf17f6f05a00ad904!2m2!1d-73.362008!2d42.1959798!3e0">via</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taconic_State_Parkway">Taconic Parkway</a>, and would exit at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_23">Route 23</a>, and that's where the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.2082784,-73.6345615,3a,75y,167.81h,80.2t/am=t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sDu5bvkTav7KMcfXsIjtzWw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DDu5bvkTav7KMcfXsIjtzWw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D45.264877%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656">Chief Diner</a> is. I bet my brother and I, when we saw <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/martindale-chief-diner-craryville">the diner</a>, begged our parents to stop. It was the middle of the night (or so it felt to me, then) and they must've been tired. Kids are a pain in the ass. Anyway, I was driving on 23 today and passed the diner, remembered it from childhood, so I stopped and took a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/chiefDiner1.jpg">couple</a> of <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/chiefDiner2.jpg">pictures</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/09.html#a180730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a113011"></a>People say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZybYIJtbcu0">Tuca and Bertie</a> is the next level of Bojack Horseman and it is that for sure. For example, in T&B there are people and animals, as in Bojack, but <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/plantAsACharacter.png">plants</a> also have intelligence and speak and have legs and can walk and go places (and are teenagers). Also they include little bits of non-animated <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/humanInTuca.png">human stuff</a> in it. And the snarky Easter eggs are even better. But it's also got a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> in it and trippy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away">Spirted Away</a> type stuff. I love the <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/05/tiffany-haddish-ali-wong-tuca-and-bertie-interview-tribeca-1202605920/">actors</a>. I'm only on Episode 4 and savoring every moment.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/09.html#a113011" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a114446"></a>I've been saying this for many years -- I wish as part of the publicity materials for shows, movies, even products, they produced standalone images that have a transparent background, like <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/bojack.png">this one</a> for Bojack. I love putting them in the right margin when I'm writing about your product. It's <i>good</i> for you. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/09.html#a114446" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a112821"></a>I use Facebook the same way I use Exxon. I need their product to get where I want to go. I don’t like what the products do to the ecosystem or the crazy attitude of the people who run the companies. But I don’t have any power over that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/09.html#a112821" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
