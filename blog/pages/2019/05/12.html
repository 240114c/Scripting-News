I remember one part. She's in the other room lying down reading, something she did a lot, and for some reason I called her on the phone. We hadn't spoken in a long time. She said "an angel is calling" in a very sentimental way. She never said stuff like that. This morning I wonder maybe I was the one who died? Happy Mother's Day mom, where ever you are, or where ever I am. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/12.html#a131708" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a151228"></a>New feature in the <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=chat">chat tab</a>, permalinks. If you roll your mouse over <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/12/permalink.png">the time</a>, next to the author's name, you'll see it's a link. Click the link to get to a page with just that item on it. It's a permalink to the <a href="http://chat.scripting.com/story?day=2019/05/12/&id=136">story page</a> for the item. That means you can point to a comment the same way you'd point to a blog post. It will continue to work even after there's a rollover of the chat stream (a fresh start that I'll do periodically). However story pages will not survive moderation, so this isn't a place to write a blog post. Respect the <a href="http://guidelines.scripting.com/">comment guidelines</a>. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üí•</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/12.html#a151228" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
