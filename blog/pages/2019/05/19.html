	<li><a name="a163837"></a>Alterately, Arya kills Daenerys, and Jon Snow, who likes Tyrion (going back to season 1) returns to the north to be with his <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ghost">dog</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tormund_Giantsbane">red-haired friend</a>. He could hook up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth">Brienne</a>, who is available now that Jaime is dead. There's your spinoff! He could pick up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samwell_Tarly">Samwell Tarly</a> and family (son named Jon, btw) on his way north. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/19/162205.html#a163837" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a163821"></a>It's crazy to think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendry">Baratheon bastard</a> is going to be accepted on the throne. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/19/162205.html#a163821" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162538"></a>But Cersei was a Lannister. Tyrion is a Lannister. He's the next in line if you believe Cersei was a valid Queen. And why not. Everyone knows that Joffrey was a Lannister as was Tommen.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/19/162205.html#a162538" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162607"></a>Seems old Tyrion has the best claim to the throne. And he's not a murderer, he drinks wine and likes to fuck (or at least he used to). He's been pretty good to everyone, and Sansa loves him. He would be a <i>good</i> king (you can almost hear him saying it). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/19/162205.html#a162607" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162630"></a>I don't think too many Kings Landing folk are going to be begging for a Targaryen to take the throne.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/19/162205.html#a162630" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I don't know if other people see this, but it seems reasonable to me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/19/162205.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
