Because you're about to lose all of them. You have to wake everybody up and say listen, this is it, after this point we do not have a government. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/21.html#a161717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

As we consume the life-sustaining ability of our planet, if we had <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2010/08/29/virgin.jpg">fewer people</a>, we'd consume it at a slower rate. I don't think there's any great reason to overpopulate the planet, esp when we're so resource-constrained. BTW, I'm a mystic, i.e. I believe in the mystery of it all. :-) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/21.html#a151759" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
