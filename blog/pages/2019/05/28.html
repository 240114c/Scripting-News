<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150457"></a>The Wikipedia page for podcasting still has some misleading info about how the name was arrived at. How it <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/howPodcastingGotItsName">actually happened</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/28.html#a150457" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a151108"></a>I remember watching the series finale of Mad Men realizing that one of the hundreds of fan theories I had read was right! That doesn't mean the author came up with the ending. Another analogy. I thought Apple's phone was going to be called iPhone. I didn't get credit for naming the phone, however. The naming of the podcast is very well documented, the archives all there. There's no reason for the Wikipedia page to carry this mistake forward. All the reporters echo the mistake. It's not fair to Dannie Gregoire who actually coined the term, or respectful of the open process we used to develop it. It was all very deliberate, took a lot of trial and error, hard work, cooperation, patience and creativity. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/05/28.html#a151108" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
