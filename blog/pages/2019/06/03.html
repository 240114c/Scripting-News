I finally tracked down what's going wrong, but it's a mystery. I also have an easy workaround, but before I do that, I'd like to see if anyone has an idea what might be going on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/03.html#a163303" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143829"></a>If journalism had the ability to look at itself critically, the way it looks at Facebook, they would find a smoking gun in this <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464">Les Moonves quote</a> from 2016. You could argue whether Facebook knew it was profiting from Trump trolling, but there's absolutely no doubt that journalism was. We need a Mueller report on this too. Any journalism outfit could do it, btw. They have access to all the sources. There should be a Pulitzer in it. But of course none of them will do it. it would require an integrity they don't have.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/03.html#a143829" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
