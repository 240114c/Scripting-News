This time I'm using a MySQL database. Three tables -- feeds, items and subscriptions. The folder structure is exactly as in <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/09/0995.html">River5</a>, except there is no data folder (the data is in the database). I am still a relative newbie in SQL databases, but I think this model works. I'm documenting as much as I can and of course I will release the Node.js source. I hope it serves as a basis for distributing RSS intelligence around the net. Last time around (Google Reader) we centralized. That was a mistake. If enough people run instances of this database we'll have a less interruptable base of functionality. I want to try out more new ideas as well. We've been really stuck for a long time. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/04.html#a151733" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Come on, make it easy for podcast players folks. Use the &lt;enclosure> element, and set the type and length correctly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/04.html#a143734" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
