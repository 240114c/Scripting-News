	<li><a name="a142937"></a>It bothers me, of course, that Elizabeth Warren, <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/">candidate</a> for president, is posting her position papers on Medium. I wrote a tweet yesterday, and cross-posted it <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/04.html#a174639">here</a>, saying as much. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a142937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

At first I thought, they won't know who I am, and they might not care about the open web. But then I thought, why wouldn't they care?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a151936" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true"><a name="a152125"></a>There are a lot of parallels in the ways big tech companies and banks regard their customers, and Warren has been such a pioneer in the reform of banks. It's a bad environmental decision, imho, for Warren to go with Medium, when the open web is just as easy, the results are as good, and the writing more likely to persist. It's worth a careful explanation of why the open web is a better choice for a thoughtful and futuristic campaign like Warren's. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a152125" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a150235"></a>When Senator Warren posts a position paper, it's a matter of public record. It's important that it be accessible for the indefinite future. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a150235" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155639"></a>If she was elected, her consituents would want to see what she promised during the campaign, in her own words, to see how it matches up with her policies as an elected official.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a155639" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150336"></a>And if she isn't elected, it's still good to keep the ideas accessible. The problems probably won't go away, and her proposals might be useful to a future candidate.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a150336" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a150856"></a>If Medium went out of business everything published there would go away. This has happened many times in tech, it's the norm. Even successful companies, such as Google, sometimes walk away from existing sites because they weren't profitable.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a150856" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a151214"></a>Their software is good, easy to use, and the resulting pages are easy to read. But this is the only thing that has been stable about Medium since its inception in 2012, as they <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/the-long-complicated-and-extremely-frustrating-history-of-medium-2012-present/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&source=hp&ei=0Ob3XLOzO5Hr_QbByIaQBQ&q=medium+pivots+ev+williams&oq=medium+pivots+ev+williams&gs_l=psy-ab.12..35i39.1587.1587..5947...0.0..0.125.206.1j1......0....2j1..gws-wiz.....0.rK_ZPDUKiEA">pivot</a> trying to find a profitable business model.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a151214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a151050"></a>It's not clear whether Warren's posts are behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall">paywall</a>, because their policies are not clear, and they change. Sometimes I hit a wall reading a random friend's post on Medium. The paywall is not only an irritant, but it limits access to people who have a credit card and are able to pay Medium for access. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a151050" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a151507"></a>People look at Medium and if they've been around a while, the questions above all come up, but then they see that a great progressive like Senator Warren is using Medium, so it must be okay. This is not good leadership, especially when setting up and running a blog in 2019 is so inexpensive and easy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a151507" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a151718"></a>My politics happen to align pretty well with Warren's, but even if I were a conservative Republican, I'd want to help get Senator Warren on the open web, because it's that important to have a serious presidential campaign take a leadership position on the independence of people who write on the open web. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html#a151718" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
