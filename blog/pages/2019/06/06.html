<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162301"></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/business/media/consumer-reports-craig-newmark.html">Journalism</a> has been very conflicted about Craig Newmark. Truth is he isn't responsible for anything other than making a product that people wanted. The news industry could have done it, but for some reason didn't.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/06.html#a162301" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153002"></a>There will come a day when a <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html">presidential candidate</a> will be judged by where they choose to post their policy statements. If they use a corporate silo, that will be like accepting campaign donations from Goldman Sachs. Not a good appearance.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/06.html#a153002" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144444"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a> is an amazing thing, but there are places it just doesn't work, like what we used to call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig">The Big Dig</a> in Boston. Too many levels of tunnels. GPS can't tell if you're underground or on the surface. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/06.html#a144444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
