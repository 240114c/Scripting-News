I saw him at the <a href="http://jerrygarciasbrokendownpalaces.blogspot.com/2011/09/academy-of-music-126-e-14th-street-new.html">Palladium</a> on 14th St in NYC in 1973 or so. I couldn't figure out what kind of person he was. He was dressed in a long robe, holding a staff like a god, masked, and had huge colorful feathers coming out of the top of his head. Sang all the Dr John hits. He got me interested in New Orleans, where I ended up going to college. He <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2019/06/06/new-orleans-iconic-musician-dr-john-has-died/">died</a> yesterday at 77. His music lives on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/07.html#a150251" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
