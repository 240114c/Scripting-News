Not Mozilla, btw, they generally do what Google says. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/13.html#a134647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144359"></a>At the Great Democratic Debate, one of the candidates should suggest they draw straws. Everyone who picks a short straw withdraws from the race, then and there, and endorses the candidate with the long straw. That would be the Democrats finally waking the fuck up and leading.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/13.html#a144359" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
