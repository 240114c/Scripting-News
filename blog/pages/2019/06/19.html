<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153106"></a>I'm glad to see a few <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23indieweb">#indieweb</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisAldrich/status/1141216395545305088">people</a> building on OPML. There's a lot you can do with it. For example, the native file format of <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a> is OPML. So it's really good for editing subscription lists for feed readers. And editing blogrolls. My <a href="http://storage.littleoutliner.com/users/davewiner/listicles/listicle1.html">listicle</a> tool takes OPML files as input. And <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/18.html#a164307">River6</a>, coming soon, does a bunch with OPML. There's also <a href="http://feedbase.io/">feedBase</a> which will blow your mind if you love sharing subscription lists. Yes there's a lot to discover in OPML-land and more on the way. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üí•</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/19.html#a153106" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155755"></a>I should write a howto to explain editing subscription lists in <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a>. I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/opmlHowto/dave/editorOpmlOrg/editSubscriptionLists.html">one</a> for the OPML Editor in 2008. It still runs btw, I use it, sometimes even to <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/19/nbalistinopmleditor.png">edit</a> subscription lists. Two key bits for LO2: 1. You can make outlines public. Look in the File menu. 2. And you can edit the attributes of a headline, click the suitcase icon in the left margin. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/19.html#a155755" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

She is what we want politicians to be. Not calculating about how to get re-elected, rather guiding our country and preserving our values. Being smart. Not being scared to say what's obvious.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/19.html#a152342" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It should be amazing. After yet another Knickless playoff season, it's interesting to see them back in the conversation somewhat. There were a lot of stupid dreams about the Knicks buying a contending team with their cap space. That's off the table because even Kawhi couldn't turn this team into a contender. The Knicks are in a rebuild, have been for many seasons, and no amount of dealing is going to make them a contender. Even the 76ers and Celtics who played it smart aren't contending yet. But at least they give their fans something to root for. The Celtics should be glad to be rid of Kyrie. Last year's team was much more interesting. Re-sign Horford and trade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward">Hayward</a> for draft picks. The most intriguing idea I heard for the Knicks is to pick up <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-chris-paul-kevin-durant-dennis-smith-jr-20190618-bwla5ckvffe5zehjyrmse3iqfq-story.html">Chris Paul</a> on waivers (haha not going to happen) or take on his awful 3-year deal, and get them to throw in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Capela">Capela</a>, say. In return they get a few mediocre young players that didn't work out (pretty much anyone on the current roster). And then what the hell, sign <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22carmelo+anthony%22&t=hj&ia=web">Melo</a> and let him play out his career in the Garden. It's not like anything else is going to happen here for the forseeable future. Sign <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22jeremy+lin%22&t=hj&ia=web">Jeremy Lin</a> (he can bring his new trophy) and <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/16.html#a155755">D'Angelo Russell</a>, and we might even make the postseason. It'll certainly be entertaining basketball. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üèÄ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/19.html#a145347" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
