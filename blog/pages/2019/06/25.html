Maybe we could even call the Nets the Knicks, why not, it's not as if the actual Knicks are doing anything with the name. Let Brooklyn have Dolan.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/25.html#a172408" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It was sold as a play. I thought that meant it was going to be dialog between characters, pure story-telling creating suspension of disbelief, but it was just another reading of the Mueller report, a good one. I would have thought that great actors would want to do a play, but it wasn't a play. It was actors reading a report written by lawyers.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/25/141606.html#a140445" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142916"></a>In the rest of this post I'll outline how the project, if it were to really have impact, would get started. It will be more of a commitment than last night's performance. But our world is worth it, don't you think??<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/25/141606.html#a142916" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140727"></a>A serial radio play, distributed as a weekly podcast. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/25/141606.html#a140727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143005"></a>Opening scene, a congressional hearing. A select committee of senators and representatives question (actors playing) Manafort, Flynn, Hicks, Comey, etc, who answer questions fully as they did for Mueller. The answers derive from the report, but they are not verbatim. The actors strive to present their characters in a good light. The congresspeople are all interested in getting the truth. Even the Repubs. This part of course is fiction. Artistic license. And the Democrats have the guts to ask probing, hard questions.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/25/141606.html#a143005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142959"></a>Dramatic interludes in the Oval Office, on Air Force One, golf courses and watching TV (executive time) where the president, played by Lithgow (an excellent choice to play Trump) gives soliloquies in the form of phone conversations with various celebs such as Hannity, Carl Icahn and a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarch">surprises</a>. We keep coming back to the hearing room, that's where the story is really being told. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/25/141606.html#a142959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170819"></a>The resulting radio show, a riveting drama, is released one episode a week as a podcast. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/25/141606.html#a170819" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
