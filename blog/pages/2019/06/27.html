	<li><a name="a145710"></a>Listening to Zuckerberg speak yesterday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, broadcast on Facebook (good move)..<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a145710" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>He talks about "data portability" -- that isn't what's needed, that's easy and no one uses it. It doesn't do anything to reduce lock-in. Useless.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150351"></a>What's needed is choice. And for that you need interop. Also easy. We have standards for that, which FB ignores. If they did it, then users would have choice. That's the old thing that tech czars like Zuck, Gates, Jobs etc won't give their users.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a150351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145715"></a>I guess he gets away with this because reporters don't insist on understanding how his ideas would work. He says just enough that's true to make you think the other stuff is true too. Slippery.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a145715" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150257"></a><b>What I mean by interop</b><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a150257" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true"><a name="a145716"></a>BTW, by interop -- it could be really simple. Just four things. They've already done a big part of one of the things on my <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html">prior checklist</a>, so I added another item. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a145716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a145758"></a>Support the HTML <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">anchor element</a> in posts, so I can link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">other places</a> on the web from my writing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a145758" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145833"></a>Titles for posts. Like the &lt;title> element in the &lt;head> section of an HTML document. To interop with other content systems, FB must have the concept of a post title.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a145833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145920"></a>Enclosures. Since podcasting has become such a big thing, FB should be compatible with the web and support this feature. It's so important, and really simple.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a145920" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145952"></a><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> in and out. This is the new item, now that they have simple styling in Facebook posts (bravo! were they listening?). With this, other blogging systems could fully peer with Facebook. People would have choice. It wouldn't cost FB anything to do this, they already are so dominant. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a145952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a150151"></a>If Facebook did all this, and I think they probably already have code to do most of it, they could make moderation a problem for the web, not just for them. It would get them out of the hot seat. It would a brilliant move, and also the right way to feed the web, which they used to build Facebook itself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/145702.html#a150151" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I thought Warren's opening answer was very good. She's learned how to bring the listener into her story. Too many politicians don't find a way to get people to think about themselves. That's key. Because people are always thinking about themselves. Once you get them to feel you're over there on their side, your ideas start clicking with them. They'll think you think like they do. They start to like you. And they start to listen. That's everything. I have to say that was the first time I could say that about Warren. Clearly she wants to win, that's also a big deal. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/144202.html#a144513" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144834"></a>Then it became clear it was just going to be canned speeches all night, I started nodding off and went back to reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall/dp/0394720245">The Power Broker</a>. I'm starting to get to the good part, the downfall of Moses. He really fucked NY. They should make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a>-like show about the life of Robert Moses. Get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_McRaney">guy</a> who <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/27/hearstDeadwood.png">played</a> Hearst to play Moses.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/27/144202.html#a144834" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
