Here's how. Occupy Washington DC until it happens. 100K people always present at the US Capitol on a rotating basis until impeachment. Sign up for one day. Your life goes on mostly uninterrupted. Wear comfy clothes. Bring lunch. Hydrate. Circulate. Yell, talk, cajole. Whatever, but be present. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29.html#a184530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142335"></a>I love that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/glorious-idealism-us-womens-national-team/593023/">she's</a> having a public feud with El Orange. We need a few more non-presidential candidates to suck Trump into the great void of celebrity-bashing. That's how we get rid of the mofo.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29.html#a142335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a210245"></a>One of the arguments in favor of Biden and other moderates is that they will get Republican votes and that would of course (imho) be good. If I thought of myself as a Repub, I'd be looking for a way to not vote for Trump, and still have self-respect.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29/210236.html#a210245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a210315"></a>I'd be susceptible to the argument that they're all socialists (I don't mind, I think <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/01/theWorldIsSocialist.html">we're all socialists</a> anyway, that's the way our economy works in the areas that matter). Bernie Sanders would press my buttons. I might not vote, instead of voting for either.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29/210236.html#a210315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a210335"></a>However, if they want to be served, they have to find a way to let us all know that they really are out there. Repubs who would vote for a Democrat if a moderate were nominated. Maybe start giving money to Klobuchar or Hickenlooper, for example.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29/210236.html#a210335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a154512"></a>First, I'm glad to hear you're building a public aggregator for Israeli blogs. Let me know when you're ready for people to come and I'll post a note on my blog.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29/154353.html#a154512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true"><a name="a154516"></a>Okay -- now to advice re River6.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29/154353.html#a154516" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a154518"></a>I never recommend waiting, and I also place a strong emphasis on moving forward with compatibility. A River5 installation can be converted to River6 quickly. It's just a matter of setting up MySQL, and then copying the <i>lists</i> folder from the river5 folder to the river6 folder. Then there's a variable amount of waiting for the river to fill up, but that's something the software does on its own. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29/154353.html#a154518" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154616"></a>All the changes are visible in the front end in <a href="http://river6.scripting.com/">river6.scripting.com</a> and <a href="http://podcatch.com/">Podcatch.com</a>, both of which use the new river browser. However it could just as easily be displaying rivers produced by River5. As far as I know there are no changes to that format between 5 and 6 (any that are present are bugs).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29/154353.html#a154616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154656"></a>I have several rivers that are mirrored to Twitter feeds, for example <a href="http://nbariver.com/">nbariver.com</a> is mirrored to <a href="https://twitter.com/nbariver">@nbariver</a>, using a Node-based utility that I wrote called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/riverToTweets">riverToTweets</a>. It's been running smoothly for years. I recommend it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/29/154353.html#a154656" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
