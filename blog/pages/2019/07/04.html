<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155424"></a>I have another idea for how to bootstrap the impeachment as mere citizens, now. If you're registered as a Democrat, change your registration to independent. That would surely get Nancy Pelosi to pay attention. I bet as soon as it became a thing, even just a few thousand switches, she'd tell Nadler to start the hearings and declare her intent to have a vote on impeachment. It's time to make the Dems feel the risks Trump is taking on behalf of all of us.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/04.html#a155424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
