<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a172253"></a>What a great win. Let's keep that energy flowing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/07.html#a172253" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144004"></a>I gave $100 to <a href="https://www.marianne2020.com/">Marianne Williamson</a> for president. She has a message that's totally worth listening to. We love America. We're not scared of the world, we lead the world. If we want a place in America for everyone, we need an expansive view of who we are and what our abilities. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/07.html#a144004" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/07/07/theAffair.png"><a name="a140058"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/07/07/theAffair.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I gave up on <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/05.html#a211151">Designated Survivor</a>, I even tried skipping ahead to the third (Netflix) season, where they say the f-word and there are naked butts, but it's just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(American_TV_series)">House of Cards</a>, idiotic. But the <a href="https://torontolife.com/culture/movies-and-tv/how-designated-survivor-built-a-replica-oval-office-in-toronto/">set</a> for the Oval Office is much better. After looking through HBO, I landed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affair_(TV_series)">The Affair</a> on Showtime. Finally something with an adult plot, and HBO style. One of the stars is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_West">McNulty</a> from The WIre and his asshole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doman">father-in-law</a> is the police chief who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rawls">tormented</a> McNulty. And the sex is not gratuitous, it's the plot. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk,_New_York">Montauk</a> is very photogenic as is McNulty's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Wilson">lover</a>. It got <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-affair">high ratings</a>, I'm in episode 3 of season one and there are four seasons, so I'm hopeful. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/07.html#a140058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They should only play the national anthem at the end of a match, and only the anthem of the winning country. That way they have something of honor to play for, and we only have to listen to one anthem.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/07.html#a145547" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
