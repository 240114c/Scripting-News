<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a163258"></a>I should talk with <a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/faculty/anton-zuiker">Anton Zuiker</a> more often. Today he showed me a project he's doing at Duke University to create podcasts for their community which is very expansive to include staff and the patients. It's called <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/listening/podcast/">Voices of Duke Health</a>. What an incredible project. They already have 16 episodes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/11.html#a163258" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150101"></a>Taco Bell is doing <a href="https://m.sfgate.com/food/article/Pacifica-taco-bell-cantina-alcohol-menu-opening-14082626.php?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=referral">innovative marketing</a>, not selling -- trying to nudge its brand upscale, and for me, it works. It's surprising, I always thought of TB as cheap fast food. I liked their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8sZ1DWsAHE">ads</a>. Two tacos for 99 cents. But this new approach is more effective imho than just advertising.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/11.html#a150101" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
