<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143500"></a>I want filters on Twitter that remove all messages from well-intentioned people expressing their outrage about trolls. After so much damage has been caused by trolls, at this point they are insane and suicidal. They have become second-order trolls.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/14.html#a143500" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was living in the 50s at the time, so was unaffected. We never lost power. I walked downtown to see what it was like. It felt post-apocalyptic, like visiting New Orleans after Katrina. The weirdest thing was walking north on Broadway in the dark, and seeing Times Square in the distance, fully lit. How like New York, I thought. It's a place of business first. The show must go on. But how would it feel to be living in the blacked-out part realizing that a few blocks to the north, life was going on, as if nothing happened.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/14/142503.html#a142535" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
