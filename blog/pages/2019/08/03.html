It'll probably be a Russian style election where the incumbent gets 98% of the vote. We can't afford to wait for that. Think about all the other crazy stuff the incumbent is doing, that we can see, and then the stuff that is being covered up. Depending on the election only makes sense as a distant Plan B. I think even most Republicans would see that at this time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03.html#a144656" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150623"></a>I'd like to see Melo and Jeremy Lin join up and become friends, work out, and reinvent basketball, and then approach the <i>right</i> team. They're smart, still-talented players. I think the stink on both of the comes from the crazy missed opportunity of the Linsanity period.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03.html#a150623" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a153006"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/yudel">Larry Yudelson</a>, a longtime reader of this blog has a commercial Mailchimp account and offered to let me use it to test nightly emails for the blog. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153006" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153014"></a>I get one test per day. Reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">punched cards</a> days of mainframes, only worse. Turnaround generally was less than an hour back then. It's okay though, I find it somewhat relaxing to consider Mailchimp only once per day. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153014" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153057"></a>Here's a <a href="https://us2.campaign-archive.com/?e=9b37eab71e&u=872b6dc1474d8545c737dfc44&id=89c814d14c">link</a> to the email for yesterday's blog posts.  I'm not sure how long that link will work, so here's an <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/post.zip">archived copy</a> and a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/emailtop.png">couple</a> of screen <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/emailbottom.png">shots</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153057" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a153315"></a>A few notes follow.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a153319"></a>I have been able to fix a bunch of the problems <a href="http://scripting.com/code/scriptingnightlyrss/email.css">using CSS</a>. But some I can't fix because they put the styles inline. No way to override those as far as I know. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154139"></a>If I could I'd get rid of the top two items. They repeat info included elsewhere. They're the kind of noise people rightly skip over. I like to take that kind of noise out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a154139" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153354"></a>They chose a really ugly color for links, and hard-code the font for headlines.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153354" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153409"></a>It's funny however that some of my overrides work when I view the email <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/correctRendering.png">in the browser</a>, vs <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/wrongRendering.png">in GMail</a>. In GMail their styles dominate. In the browser, mine do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153451"></a>The way my email address appears in the <i>By</i> line abuses the &lt;author> element in <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a>. If I wanted it to link to an HTML page about me, instead of providing my email address (a real mistake), I would have to break the &lt;author> element. That's fucked up. They should have a namespace that calls for exactly what they want and not force people to break RSS to get a good result. Interop isn't any use if people don't respect it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153451" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a153652"></a>Anyway, I can't make it perfect, but I can make it okay. I'm thinking of trying another service that has an API and see if I can make it perform better. They do call this blog <i>Scripting</i> News after all. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/03/152923.html#a153652" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
