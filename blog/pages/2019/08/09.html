I wasn't trying to sell you anything. I just wrote what occurred to me. He was a mainframe programmer. I've thought about that, and I'd love to understand how one can be a programmer and not <i>always</i> be searching for the truth. Unlike just about any other profession I can think of, ours depends on telling the truth.<i>You can't lie to a compiler</i> is one of my programming mottos. Garbage in garbage out. I write blog posts the same way a tester writes reviews of software. You have to be ready to hear the unvarnished truth. That's the ethos of blogging as far as I'm concerned. And it's why tech bloggers can do it better than most. Not saying they do of course. There was some real shabby blogging around HTTPS and <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google</a>, I kept wanting to ask if they debug their software with that kind of logic? (The equiv of asking a troll if they kiss their mother with that mouth.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/09.html#a191740" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145855"></a>Those were incredible times, we had tons of what I called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22blue+sky%22&t=hj&ia=web">blue sky</a>, probably more possibility for technology and humanity since the 1920s (the advent of electricity and cars).

Learned a lot. Most of the problems were with how HTML email works these days, not Mailchimp. I needed to factor it out to see that. On the other hand they do some stuff that I can't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYsw0KVRjCM">abide</a>, so this is a necessary exercise. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/09/185406.html#a185411" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a190152"></a>Don't use lists unless you want their indentation. There appears to be no way to override it. I was using lists, per standard best practices, for stories. I did a hack and replaced all &lt;ul>s and &lt;li>s with divs, and styled them the way I wanted them to look. (This will fuck up deeply nested lists in my stories. Thinking about how to avoid that. Come to think of it, it will probably fuck up this very list. Heh.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/09/185406.html#a190152" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a190322"></a>I'm using AWS to send the mail, and I'm going to have to do some kind of dance to configure it to let me send email from an address I never use. I can't use my gmail address, because I am not sending the email from gmail. That is a new architecture of the net created by who-the-hell-knows since I last did any programming with email. Not saying it's bad, it was something I had to learn about. I suspect that it will be a rejiggering of the dance you have to go to get an HTTPS server, why not use the same dance? I will be learning more about this for sure. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/09/185406.html#a190322" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
