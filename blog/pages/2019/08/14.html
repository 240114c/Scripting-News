<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155812"></a>My <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/22/baruchWiner.gif">grandfather</a> warned me about <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/14/grandfather.png">this</a>. I didn't believe him at the time, when I was a child. He <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy">used</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy">words</a> I thought were old-fashioned, but now we use them all the time. I <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/02/09/ipromisedmygrandfather.html">represent</a> him the best I can in the world he predicted so well.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/14.html#a155812" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielleDigest/status/1161416013688320006">said</a> it isn't a high priority. I've often wondered about this. Facebook lets you edit everything you write, and it hasn't seemed to affect the community in any way I can perceive. I use it all the time. Maybe the question is a technical one for Twitter. Perhaps they built their internal server network around the assumption that content can't be modified. Then it might cost a lot of money they don't have to rebuild their server setup. If this were the case I could see why they wouldn't want to disucss it publicly given how little most reporters and users are aware of how the tech works behind the curtain. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/14.html#a140150" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135803"></a>I saw Quentin Taratino's latest (no spoilers). If you love his movies as I do, you can see how an artist can play with our perceptions of the past, and how important it is to see directly what happened. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/14.html#a135803" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's mostly general ideas because none of us has the power to move the domain or the content.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/14/132503.html#a132545" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a131930"></a>The site is still accessible through the original URLs, but there's a big question about whether it will remain there much longer. Here's the background via <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/08/13/on-linux-journal/">Doc Searls</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/14/132503.html#a131930" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132603"></a>There's a consensus that porting the sit to <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> is the answer. Jon Udell, a highly respected developer says <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1161475760537817088">on Twitter</a> that redirecting to archive.org, as Doug Kaye does, is the "gold standard" for preserving sites. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/14/132503.html#a132603" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132850"></a>I've always resisted this, instead preferring that we take steps to make the web itself more <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+future-safe&oq=site%3Ascripting.com+future-safe&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.2102j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">permanent</a>. An analogy. Recently I visited the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/vama/index.htm">Vanderbilt Mansion</a> on the Hudson River. I didn't visit an archive.org snapshot of it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_Mansion_National_Historic_Site#History">1940</a> when it was given to the government by the Vanderbilt family. There was value to me that it was in the original location, with the same view of the river and the mountains off in the distance. That it wasn't air conditioned. That the same roads that went there when the Vanderbilts were in residence still go there today. It was the same place the elite played on Saturday nights in spring and fall during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age">Gilded Age</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/14/132503.html#a132850" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132720"></a>I feel the same about the web. But people seem to feel that an archive.org snapshot and redirected URLs is the best we can do. Maybe we should change our idea of what the web is. Maybe archive.org <i>is</i> the permanent version of the web. And then of course the next question is why not just publish originally to archive.org? I'm sure they've thought of this at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/14/132503.html#a132720" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
