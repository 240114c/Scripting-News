Here's a scenario. I have to make a minor change to a package. So I increment the version in package.json, and <i>npm publish</i> it. Then in the app that's using it, I do an <i>npm update. </i>The update happens. But the app doesn't get the latest version. Something is cached somewhere, because if I look in the node_modules folder, the new version is there. I've resorted to using a lib folder and keeping a copy of the package updated there. But of course I'm reinventing npm in scripts by doing this. Sometimes NPM works as I understand it should, but every so often it goes crazy like this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/17.html#a162321" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I know as a matter of math that these requirements doesn't make passwords better. Does it help people who type <i>asdf</i> as their password come up with more random strings? Also I hate sites that make me create a new password every so often. I can manage that myself. I suppose maybe they're saying hey we were hacked recently and are requiring everyone to change their passwords instead of making a public statement.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/17.html#a155942" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
