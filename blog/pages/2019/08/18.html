<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153441"></a>I read this <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190818/p2#a190818p2">VC appraisal of Dropbox vs Slack</a>, which service was going to be the foundation for groupware in the enterprise world. I was unaware of this perspective and it was enlightening. I have studied both. Slack has the API, Dropbox went it alone. I think if Dropbox had fully embraced the idea that it was a developer's platform, there were a few small doors they had to open, they would have become the storage for networked apps. Same with Amazon S3. Each had the opportunity to bridge into the others' space, but neither has. I think the assumption at Dropbox was they knew everyone who was capable of making great groupware apps. That was their mistake. It's still not too late, they are dominant and totally baked in. They should be killing instead they are flailing. One of the biggest wasted opportunities I've seen in my career. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/18.html#a153441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm looking over the review summaries <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/big-little-lies/season-2">on Metacritic</a>, and see they're all based on the first three episodes only. This was the same problem with software reviews, back when they did reviews of software (too bad they stopped). They would review the software based on a day's worth of use, if that much. But we design software so that it gets better the more you use it. We balance the tradeoffs. Of course we want the product to be easy to learn, but we also want it to be something you use all the time. It's as ridiculous to judge a serial show based on a third of a season. If I make it through the whole season, which seems likely based on the first season, I'll review the whole thing here on my blog. And I still have to relaunch <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/tv/">bingeworthy</a> so we accumulate judgements of Scripting News readers on these shows. I have an idea how to do it. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/18.html#a141617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
