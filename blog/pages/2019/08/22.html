<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134242"></a>New feature. Now you can receive Scripting News every night via email. It's still in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/125">testing</a> and there's a little more development work to do, but it's ready for people to try it out. I created my own system because I <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/09/185406.html">wanted</a> more control over how it works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/22.html#a134242" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154750"></a>It’s time for a news channel that only reports on how we’re getting rid of Trump and Repubs. If there’s nothing to report they play old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV">MTV</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0">videos</a> from the 80s.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/22.html#a154750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

A few comments. It's a bit of a loop-close because my blogging used to go out via email for years before I went exclusively web. Once <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> was up and running it seemed counter-productive to keep pushing the email channel, and for a while it made sense until Google dominated and then shut down their RSS app. Then email resurged. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/22/002502.html#a003005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a003109"></a>In May 2017 I rebooted the original style of blogging on Scripting News, with intermixed titleless posts and and longer titled posts, all on one page, archived daily and monthly. It's now stable, so it made sense to bring back the email. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/22/002502.html#a003109" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a003130"></a>I remember when I turned off the email, Doc Searls said I shouldn't do it. I never forgot that. Glad Doc is in the initial group of subscribers. I think that will affect the way I write here, for the better. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/22/002502.html#a003130" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a003155"></a>BTW, I plan to add the linkblog links for the day to the daily email. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/22/002502.html#a003155" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
