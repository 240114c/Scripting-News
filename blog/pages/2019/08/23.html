<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a020821"></a>Today I learned, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/podcasts/the-daily/1619-project.html">via  the Daily podcast</a>, that Lincoln's plan, after the slaves were freed, was that they would emigrate to another country. He didn't see an America with free blacks and whites co-existing as workable. This isn't what they taught us in grade school.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23.html#a020821" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They had academics theorizing, but none said the obvious reason why all Russian-inspired autocrats do anything -- to squeeze every dollar of value that's available to them by selling off some asset of the country. Usually at small fractions of a penny on the dollar. They don't care. Everything the country owns is ripe to plunder. Bolsonaro (and Trump et al) has enough bullshit to throw at journalists to keep them debating every reason but the real one, which for some reason no one seems to be able to say. They're looting their country. Same reason the Repubs in the US want to kill Social Security and Medicare. They want the money for themselves. .<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23.html#a162134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152754"></a>The <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/j-d-davis-singles-on-a-sharp-line-drive-to-left-fielder-tyler-naquin-michael-con">Mets</a> are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBjPm_C-53E">amazing</a>. They just keep winning. Next up is Atlanta, a tough team for the Mets.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23.html#a152754" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFa39MV07kE"><a name="a192755"></a>I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFa39MV07kE">Mets clip from 2015</a>, and remembered the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmer_Flores">Wilmer Flores</a> that was spark that lit the fire for the Mets amazing late summer and postseason that year. He isn't on the Mets anymore, he's with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Seeing his <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/23/flores.png">picture</a> makes me worry for his mental health. Here was a boy who <a href="https://deadspin.com/wilmer-flores-cries-after-learning-hed-been-traded-sta-1720990537">cried</a> when he thought he was traded. We all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiIkjt1EF3w">loved</a> him for that. This is sad.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23.html#a192755" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/23/linkblogInEmailScreenShot.png">screen shot</a> that illustrates. These are the links I publish during the day to Twitter, to the linkblog <a href="http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> and to the <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links tab</a> on scripting.com. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23.html#a184743" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

How they got the idea, how it morphed from being a studio in the town of Woodstock to an outdoor concert on a field in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallkill,_Ulster_County,_New_York">Wallkill</a>, the town limited the attendance to 5000 (there were already hundreds of thousands of tickets sold) so they had to scramble with just a few weeks to go, find a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Historic+Site+of+the+1969+Woodstock+Festival/@41.699124,-74.8813829,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1swoodstock+festival+bethel!3m4!1s0x89dca8a984798b11:0xe6d7490947a9149!8m2!3d41.7010945!4d-74.8804605">new location</a>, build a stage, etc.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23/143834.html#a143838" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144504"></a>They told story of how they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavy_Gravy#Woodstock_Festival">made</a> it such a peaceful cooperative event (it wasn't by accident). They were competent, smart, and driven -- and obviously under a lot of pressure from all sides, but they pulled it off. Remarkable and as it turns out, historic.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23/143834.html#a144504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144806"></a>When I started watching i thought I'd watch for five or ten minutes, but I went all the way through. A great story well told. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23/143834.html#a144806" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a150812"></a>They had to do a lot of stuff to prevent it from being a disaster.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23/143834.html#a150812" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a151414"></a>For example, they chartered a jet to fly in Wavy Gravy and Hog Farm to do security. An inspired idea. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23/143834.html#a151414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a151424"></a>Then the NYS governor (Nelson Rockefeller) wanted to send in the National Guard to clear the place without any thought to the scale of the event.

	<li><a name="a151443"></a>They relied on army helicopters to shuttle medical personnel in, and that started rumors (remember this was 1969, it was as much an antiwar event as it was a music festival), and the guy on the PA system had to keep everything positive. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23/143834.html#a151443" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a151406"></a>People who knew how crowds work said there's no way this won't melt down, but it didn't. A lot of forethought went into it. Worth watching the show just for that part of the story.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/23/143834.html#a151406" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
