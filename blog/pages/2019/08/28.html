My two cents. I would like to see MIT and Harvard people use their prestige to set us on a better course as a society. Most people there are too risk-averse, trying to protect their careers. What a waste. We don't live long enough for that to be a proper motivation imho. That said I'm not so cynical. I have been able to get stuff done personally at Harvard, it's actually a pretty good place to shake things up, if you don't care about getting your position renewed (which I guess I didn't). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/28.html#a180800" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Talk about small pieces loosely joined. Anyway that's done now, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">praise Murphy</a>. I was thinking after reading this <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml">piece</a> about protocols over platforms, which I could not agree with more, that I have an almost-finished JavaScript implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">XML-RPC</a>, running on client and server. Since it's my second time through this area, I did it better than last time. It's just a matter of writing docs, testing, and getting other people interested/excited, and most important updating the <a href="http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/">XML-RPC website</a>, which hasn't been touched in many years. Might be just the project for my newly powerful <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/28.html">blog</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/28.html#a172556" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174240"></a>BTW there is still one part of the Dave-via-email feature that hasn't been tested since the shakeup, the sending of nightly emails. We will find out if that works at midnight tonight. I can't test it by sending emails to everyone. The changes weren't very great, just a URL and the format of a JSON file. I'm optimistic that it will work, but since it's software, I'm praying <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üôè</span> too. If you're reading this in an email, it worked. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/28.html#a174240" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
