I watched most of the game, switching back and forth between it and MSNBC. I started to go to bed after the Mets batted in the ninth, I thought for sure the game was over, merely a formality to get the last three batters out. The Mets <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/game?gameId=401076805">were ahead</a> 10-4. The home team, the Nationals were defeated, in a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/04/turner.png">humiliatingly stupid way</a>, not just hitting, ptiching and base-running. Well by the time I got upstairs, with the game on my iPhone, I couldn't believe the score. Runners on second and third, tying run at the plate, one out. I thought well either they win or lose, I'm going to wash up, take my vitamins, brush my teeth, etc. Just as I was grabbing the toothbrush, a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/edwin-diaz-in-play-run-s-to-kurt-suzuki">walk-off home run</a>. I decided then and there that this was the end of the Mets season. It was a nice run, August was great, but there's no way a team comes back from this. Not even the Mets. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04.html#a134115" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140325"></a>BTW the <a href="https://youtu.be/LlgZfeLDFQk?t=317">moment</a> when the Mets lost was when Pete Alonso, "put the icing on the cake" with a home run to put the Mets ahead 10-4. Don't ever say stuff like that. God is listening, esp when it's the Mets. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04.html#a140325" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135740"></a>Seriously I'm glad the Mets lost the way they did last night. It reminds me that deep inside the Mets philosophy is not about winning. It's about being the Mets.

Yesterday after picking up prescriptions at the CVS in Woodstock (I get confused because the name is so similar to Woodside) as I was walking out I saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lang_(producer)">Mike Lang</a>, one of the promoters of the Woodstock festival in 1969 (where Joan Baez played, btw). Until I saw the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/woodstock/">PBS special</a>, I didn't realize what an accomplishment it was, because they did it without enough time or people or money. Of course the moment passed, I'm glad I didn't say anything because everyone should be able to stop in at the pharmacy without meeting strangers who feel they already know them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04.html#a131702" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a141036"></a>In JavaScript they have <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jS/js_let.asp">const, var and let</a> which control how things are stored. Every language has these. Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software">Frontier</a>, I got used to having persistent data storage. If I created something in the object database, the kernel took care of persisting it. I could just use it like memory that was always there, and didn't have to worry about saving it to files. I find all the time I wish that JavaScript had this. I think I may have finally figured out how that might work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html#a141036" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141156"></a>Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1168981114083598336">the idea</a>. A new storage attribute called persist. It can only apply to global objects. You could write this:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html#a141156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1">
	<li><a name="a141245"></a>persist serialnum = 0;<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html#a141245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="a141257"></a>Then you could do normal operations on it like:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html#a141257" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a141309"></a>serialnum++;<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html#a141309" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="a141313"></a>Next time the app runs it already has a value. Unlike with <i>var</i> or <i>const</i> the initialization code only runs when there is no <i>persist</i> object named serialnum (i.e. the first time the app runs with this value declared).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html#a141313" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141356"></a>It would be easy to implement this in the language interpreter. It might even be possible with proxies. I don't understand them well enough yet to know. I also think you could do it with somewhat less elegant code using an NPM package.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html#a141356" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141515"></a>Matt Terrenzio <a href="https://twitter.com/mterenzio/status/1169244024223481856">asks</a> "Persist where?" My response: Somewhere. Anywhere really. Probably in a file on the local hard drive, stored in JSON. It could be in a database or in the cloud. It should be something that the developer can override, and it should default to something simple. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html#a141515" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
