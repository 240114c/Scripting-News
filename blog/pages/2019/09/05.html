An organization at MIT focused on tech and media could do a lot of good, for very little money, by sending technologists into the world with a mission to create great open tech for the people. Instead the focus is on what percent of the world's billionaires you're on a first-name basis with, laundering their reputations by accepting their money. The work they do at the Media Lab is almost incidental. I understand why normal people feel so much disdain for the elite, because the dishonesty shines through, even if the details remain hidden. Read the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614264/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joi-ito-nicholas-negroponte-funding-sex-abuse/amp/">MIT Tech Review story</a> about yesterday's meeting to see how lost they are. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/05.html#a134822" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a000454"></a>Trump's <a href="https://www.apnews.com/416144d854fb4302a9f34cccae81b0e0">obsession</a> with Alabama is a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1169727932593561601">test</a> to see what happens if he modifies official government documents. Answer -- bewilderment. Otherwise nothing stops him.  This is how you win an election that you really lost. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/05.html#a000454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a204322"></a>I created a new Node package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/persists">persists</a>. Here's a <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/a1108dd5a394c1e1886d4fc6bbcfcbdf">test app</a> that uses it. Docs coming. I think this is the closest you get to imitating the Frontier object database, syntactically and functionally, in JS. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/05.html#a204322" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/pierrejoubert73/902cc94d79424356a8d20be2b382e1ab">how to</a> do it. If you enclose text in an XML &lt;details> element it is collapsable.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155231"></a>The other day I wrote about an <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html">idea</a> for persistent objects in JavaScript. It was dream of course because it requires a change in the language. So then I wanted to see how much of it you could implement with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy">Proxy</a> feature, which I <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/122">explored</a> with Ted Howard thirty days ago, and it turns out -- quite a bit! Here's a <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/6ca719a6c332be44e6ff6c82517a34ba">test Node app</a> that demonstrates. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/05.html#a155231" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
