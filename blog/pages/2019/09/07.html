It's going to be part of every Node app I create from now on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/07.html#a170158" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The challenge is to use your agreeable nature to protect and promote innovators who generally rub donors the wrong way. As they say in the <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA">great Apple ad</a>, they're the ones who actually get it done.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/07.html#a144855" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a141432"></a>Phil Windley, a developer friend from Utah, asks via email about the motivation for the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/persists">persists package</a>. Here's the story. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/07/141421.html#a141432" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141440"></a>I was writing a bit of example code for another package I am working on. I iterated over it, factoring and simplifying until it was really easy to see what's going on. I pride myself on really easy to follow example code, because it's what I most need when I'm trying to figure out a new package, I figure it'll help others. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/07/141421.html#a141440" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141542"></a>Then I decided to add a small feature that required a tiny bit of persistent data, a serialnum. Of course this comes up all the time, I have a standard practice for it. But in this example, the persistence code <i>doubled the size</i> of the demo, and hid the elegance and simplicity of the code I was trying to demo. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/07/141421.html#a141542" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141633"></a>In Frontier, of course, saving a scalar with persistence is simply a matter of assigning a value to it. The kernel takes care of everything else. All the years I've been working in JavaScript, I've been searching for that simplicity. The language is so hackable I figured there must be a way. And when they added the Proxy feature, it did become possible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/07/141421.html#a141633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141707"></a>That's what persists is. It makes persistent values almost as simple as Frontier. The point is simplicity and factoring overhead from your mainline code into a package. And that's a big deal. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/07/141421.html#a141707" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141753"></a>To really bring it home, here's the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/examples/mailservice/mailservice.js">example app</a> I was talking about, after I used persists. And here are the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/commit/38504e097ec2df29b2c242bac3d452ae23a808d2#diff-69efe25839c01bf1a31a1d98f9f793d9">changes</a>. And btw, I have an even <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html">simpler approach</a>, but I can't do it unless I can change the JavaScript language spec, which probably isn't going to happen. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üôè</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/07/141421.html#a141753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
