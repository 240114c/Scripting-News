	<li><a name="a144312"></a>It's why I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/01.html#a115048">here</a> a week ago that the last thing I want to see is a Netflix series on the life of Bill Gates. I know the things he did to make his money. I didn't begrudge him his initial victory. He was tougher and smarter and took bigger risks than his competitors. He stared down IBM, when they deserted him, and won. That's a story that should be told, because winning there, the way he did, was heroic. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/08/144021.html#a144312" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a144438"></a>What Gates did after he achieved dominance is where it was no longer a matter of skill and determination. It was the old layer of technology trying to prevent the new layer from booting up. As the web was growing, when the people behind it were academics with little funding and inexperienced Silicon Valley startups, he tried to kill it. And he didn't give up. It was Bill Gates vs the future. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/08/144021.html#a144438" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145320"></a>The future needed our protection, but the press and government, and yes -- institutions like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab">MIT Media Lab</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brockman_(literary_agent)">Brockman</a> -- they feed off the vast fortunes people like Gates accumulate. To them it's their blood, they operate a huge PR machine and a vanity press for billionaires, and unless the ones that make the huge money need redemption to become saints, like latter-day <a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/08/01/207272849/how-andrew-carnegie-turned-his-fortune-into-a-library-legacy">Carnegies</a>, they won't get to be the heroes that reputation launderers like Negroponte and Joi Ito create.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/08/144021.html#a145320" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Stop worshipping the billionaires, they don't know how to get us out of the corner we're in as a civilization and honestly it doesn't seem that they want to. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/08/144021.html#a145548" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
