<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/21/bloatwareBoss.png"><a name="a142432"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/21/bloatwareBoss.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A minor league football coach could figure out how to beat Trump. It requires minor collaboration between the Democratic Party and the entertainment world. We need programming to go up against Trump. The programming has to be about Trump, because he's made himself the story. But it has to tell the story he doesn't want told, in as dramatic a fashion as he tells his story. It doesn't have to be good drama, it won't reach into your soul and make you cry, it doesn't need to because Trump can't do that. What it has to do is fill you with rage. Grab and hold your attention. But it must not be done by the Democratic candidate. The Republican team only has one play. It's a game where the quarterback runs. So you just fill the field with defensive backs. When Trump moves, destroy him. When he moves again, destroy him again. With what? Acting, childish pranks and low comedy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/12.html#a142432" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When you change the password on an account, think about the apps that connect to that account, and change them too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/12.html#a082504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
