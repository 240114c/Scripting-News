It went off in a lot of directions, I brought it back to what I think is a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1172912815054737408">constructive first step</a>.

Lots of room for growth here.  ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/14.html#a164047" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
