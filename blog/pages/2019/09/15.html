The main character, a member of the British aristocracy, said he was God and spread a message of love for all. Some great jokes. It appears they have the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijd8bregkt4">whole movie</a> on YouTube, for free. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15.html#a193238" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Suppose I request a link to a story, you include a code in the url, so when you get a hit you know it came thru me. At least deduct that page from my monthly quota.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a172245"></a>It took hours of digging through various bits of software to figure out that the <a href="https://twitter.com/nbariver">nbariver</a> Twitter account had been suspended because they thought it was sharing personal information inappropriately. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/twitterComplaint.png">screen shot</a> of the report. Obviously we were not sharing personal information, just <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/tweetInQuestion.png">relaying</a> a news report from the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/13/michael-porter-jr-adam-silver-cell-phone/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dp-sports-nuggets+%28Denver+Post%3A+Sports%3A+Nuggets%29">Denver Post</a> that some sharing had taken place. This is interesting because a human obviously would be able to tell the difference, and also it's exactly what we were discussing on Twitter over the last few days, how to automate these things. I did not delete the tweet, it was completely innocent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15.html#a172245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a153035"></a>Yesterday I posted an item <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/14.html#a164047">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1172912815054737408">on Twitter</a> suggesting a collection of RSS feeds from news orgs managed by one or more universities. There were a few responses from people who believe they at least have a good start on this, so let me flesh out the idea a bit. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15/153025.html#a153035" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li><a name="a153119"></a>Think of it as a process more than a product. A list frozen in time isn't very useful. We have lots of those. The idea here is that the list is maintained, it grows and shrinks as new feeds are created, new organizations get on board, and of course some fall off. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15/153025.html#a153119" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153233"></a>I think the people should come from a university or a group of universities. It could be a student project. Lots of people flow through the project over time, and go out into the world and help build awareness of the project. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15/153025.html#a153233" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154512"></a>Having a list that no one knows about is pointless. There should be marketing activity for the project, a Twitter feed, Facebook group, what else? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15/153025.html#a154512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154514"></a>All popular feed formats are supported. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15/153025.html#a154514" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153401"></a>Feeds should be added conservatively. The quality of the feeds is very important. The list should be culled of dupilicates, different URLs for the same resource. Don't worry about including two feeds that include similar stories (for example, there is a sports feed for the NYT and also a New York news feed, stories about the Knicks would appear in both, this is not a problem, ).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15/153025.html#a153401" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154004"></a>Use the standard <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#subscriptionLists">OPML subscription list</a> format as documented. Add attributes to any item with the metadata you have for it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15/153025.html#a154004" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153941"></a>Open source all the way. MIT License for any software, and Creative Commons for the list itself. Create a GItHub repository to store the list and any associated documentation. It can be distributed in other ways of course, via a website, an internet-accessible database.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/15/153025.html#a153941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
