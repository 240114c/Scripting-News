I like that IE/Microsoft is using and improving Chromium, it also keeps Google honest." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/19.html#a153449" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141528"></a>Thanks for reading my <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">blog via email</a>. I love the comments, esp since only I see them,  there's less grandstanding, pontificating, more hey here's a book you'd like, or I listened to that podcast too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/19.html#a141528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In the evening I make orange juice from concentrate to drink, with ice, while watching the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#2">Mets</a>. I leave about 1/2 glass for the morning, when I throw in frozen fruit, a heaping tablespoon of yogurt and a bit of warm water, and zap it in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBQ1AIG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">blender</a>. Pour it into a big glass and sip it for an hour or so while I write in the morning. It's delicious, cold, tasty and nutritious. I feel very loved. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/19.html#a134048" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a132905"></a>Yesterday I got an email from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman's</a> PR person, <a href="https://www.sylviapaull.com/">Sylvia Paull</a>, who I've known for many years. She was updating me on how he had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Controversy_and_resignation_from_MIT_and_Free_Software_Foundation">lost</a> his position at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> and at the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> in recent days. Of course I had been following the story. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/19/132858.html#a132905" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133941"></a>I offered advice, in an email, which I am including below. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/19/132858.html#a133941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1">
	<li><a name="a133303"></a>I feel for Stallman. On the other hand he had a long run and was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Honors_and_awards">celebrated</a> in so many ways, given an office at MIT, had a foundation. Some of us would have loved that kind of support. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/19/132858.html#a133303" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133324"></a>As his PR person I think you can help by first learning from others' mistakes in these situations. There have now been lots of them. A mistake a lot of people make is trying to fight back or argue with the judgement. I don't think that works. If he has the money, taking some time off, writing software perhaps, fixing bugs in other people's stuff. Not being such a big guy for a while. Live a <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html">human-size life</a>. Imagine what he could come up with if he wasn't always out traveling and evangelizing? I've done it. I even write software just for myself these days, no intention to publish ever. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/19/132858.html#a133324" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133336"></a>Best advice is to slow down, set your expectations on a longer horizon, and do some self-improvement. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/19/132858.html#a133336" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
