I liked how people were asked to take a minute and introduce themselves to the people around them. Wouldn't it be great if everyone left with a task they would do to make the world better, right now, not after Warren gets elected. This is what we need, meaningful things each of us can do to make things better. We yearn to belong and to do good work.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20.html#a183420" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a202623"></a>The only reason not to impeach Trump, as far as I can see, is it could hurt the Democratic Party.

Two 1/2 hour episodes left. It is of a genre, wild misunderstood-as-crazy super-powered young woman, as much a victim of her powers as master of them. Undone is something like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/russian-doll/season-1">Russian Doll</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/killing-eve">Killing Eve</a>. I'll know more when I finish. But it's one of the best shows ever. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20.html#a152118" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The product arrives when it was supposed to and it works and that's that. But sometimes something goes wrong.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html#a130357" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a131055"></a>On July 26, I ordered an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WNEJCBE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">outdoor thermometer</a>. Not expensive, $10. But it was broken when I opened the package, and I cut my finger, it bled.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html#a131055" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143139"></a>I went to the Order page and reported that it arrived broken. I just wanted to throw it out, not wanting to handle the broken glass, possibly injuring myself again, or someone who had to handle it at UPS or at Amazon. That was the right thing to do. The Amazon rep said OK, they would credit me for the thermometer. Honestly I was surprised it was that easy. I ordered another one (which arrived unbroken and I'm using it).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html#a143139" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Well, about a week ago, I got an email saying I needed to send the thermometer back or I'd be charged for it. There was no way to respond. I got another notice a few days later saying they had charged me for it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Okay $10 isn't going to make a difference to me, but it would make even less of a difference to Amazon. And they agreed to the arrangement, and it was the right thing to do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a130409"></a>So I thought I'd write it up <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html">here</a> on my blog. Maybe someone in an executive role at Amazon will see it, and will change their system so it's easier for customers to talk to them, and make sure when they agree to something, they stick to it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html#a130409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
