That's all. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/28.html#a160528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162833"></a>So many people saying now that they knew what Trump was doing but no one listened. Anyone who was paying attention knew. The problem wasn't that no one listened, it was that no one wanted to do anything about it. We all wanted to get out of it with someone <i>else</i> taking the risk. Mueller was supposed to be our savior, but he didn't want to risk it either. BTW, the thing that changed this time is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/trump-ukraine-whistleblower-is-cia-employee-worked-at-white-house.html">the whistleblower</a>, god bless them. Someone was willing to stick their neck out for all of us.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/28.html#a162833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I have been listening. Here's my reaction -- it sounds just like Abbey Road, which is so deeply ingrained in my being it might as well be part of my DNA. In other words I can't hear any difference. I hope whoever got the money ($10 for MP3s) does something good with it. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/28.html#a155508" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
