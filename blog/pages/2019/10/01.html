<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180836"></a>Because Barr is in such a <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2019/10/01/the-dangerous-position-of-william-barr/">precarious position</a>, and he's smart, he must have factored in the risk before going out on the limb. He's betting that he and Trump et al will be able to toss the Constitution in a trash can, and govern any way they want, without oversight and inconvenient co-equal branches of government. We're at much at risk as he is.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/01.html#a180836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182232"></a>Trump is breaking the Constitution. Openly, and it'll never be repaired if he isn't cancelled. We should have fought this "civil war" a long time ago, but all the time we delay the chances of our form of govt surviving goes down.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/01.html#a182232" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The original idea, 25 years ago, was letting go of product ideas that I wouldn't be able to commercialize. It, in turn, generated ideas that would define a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">industry</a>. The big idea of blogging would turn out to be <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html">Sources Go Direct</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/01.html#a172740" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a171605"></a>In the almost-25 years of blogging on <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a>, I did take a few weeks off here and there.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140047"></a>My two cents on changing Facebook to keep its power manageable. 1. Its social graph should be a public resource. Spin it out. The APIs should be open like the web APIs are. 2. Facebook should peer with the open web, so it isn't a silo.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/01.html#a140047" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If we've learned anything about the future -- of everything -- is that it's disruptive to the way things are. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/01.html#a133515" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
