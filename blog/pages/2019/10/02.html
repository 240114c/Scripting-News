<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a002959"></a>The reporting on Ukraine misses an important point. Not only was Trump putting the squeeze on Ukraine to become part of his mob, he was also selling them out. A small relatively powerless country that depended on our protection, Trump was stepping back and letting Russia roll over them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/02.html#a002959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWiqycRVkvc"><a name="a152414"></a>Michael Moore was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWiqycRVkvc">guest on MSNBC</a> last night. It was really refreshing. He provides the perspective of a person. He thinks Biden should be leading the fight against Trump. I agreed with everything he said. Clear thinking. Totally worth watching.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/02.html#a152414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

For example, David Boroditsky checked in yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/boroditsky/status/1179081346943078400">on Twitter</a>. He sent a link to an email he sent me, which I <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/stories/DavidBoroditsky.html">posted</a> to the blog, in Oct 1996, two years after the start. He talks about the non-web features of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software">Frontier</a>. Sometimes I forget that Frontier and the blog were two sides of the same coin in the early days. All the early blogging and RSS software ran in Frontier. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/02.html#a151102" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
