His goal was to reduce the US to chaos. Our elections are now meaningless. Mass killings by people with automatic weapons. No sense of normalcy. The news people are focused on impeachment, but since just after the 2016 election have buried the big story. The US has been defeated. We're occupied. We live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_France">Vichy</a> America. The president is a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17576956/transcript-putin-trump-russia-helsinki-press-conference">Russian asset</a>. It's all out in the open, but until the whistleblower, no one, not Mueller, not the Repubs in Congress, not the Dems in Congress, nor the Dems running for president, have had the guts to say the truth out loud. We all hope someone else will take the risk. We have to fight to get out of this. It's going to be bloody. But the longer we wait the worse it'll be.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/04.html#a125734" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

My two cents. This will be remembered as the time we all waited for someone else to take the risk, not wanting to disturb our lives. The spoiled citizens of a country that fought wars without a draft, that got tax cuts in time of war, inflated our economy as we inflicted chaos on others.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/04.html#a165816" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

My two cents. This is what‚Äôs wrong with today‚Äôs net, that it‚Äôs up to one unelected unaccountable tech exec to decide if the elected president has a voice. Twitter has too much power. They endow people they like with millions of followers, and delete accounts for friends. No one has to listen to Trump. I‚Äôve had him blocked for years.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/04.html#a124341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
