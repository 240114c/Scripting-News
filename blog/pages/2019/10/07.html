<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174741"></a>Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/07/ghtfoot.png">brief editorial</a> on Trump as president.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174945"></a>On the <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">Brian Lehrer Show</a> this morning the question came up of why Trump released the "transcript" of his talk with the Ukranian president. I have a theory about that which I <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1181212175513346049">tweeted</a> to the show. It goes like this. Trump approved of its release without reading the transcript, or listening to his advisors. They wanted it released because it prevents Trump from throwing them under the bus. It's the new reality of a president who has the attention span of a gnat. Sometimes that works against him more than it works against us. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07.html#a174945" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a175646"></a>Theory why Repubs don't stand up to Trump. After the 2016 election, the Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Measures_(film)">active measures</a> campaign turned to building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat">kompromat</a> on every Republican member of Congress. It didn't take long to get each one of them in a position where they had to listen to Russia and Trump. This is one of those <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Occam%27s+News">Occam's News</a> things. Like black holes in space, you can't see them, but you can infer their presence by the way bodies behave around them<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07.html#a175646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-urltweet="https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1181249348824379393"><a name="a165734"></a>Anyway, I find myself hooking into <a href="https://twitter.com/PitchingNinja/status/1181268716056657925">videos</a> on Twitter more and more. Like this ridiculous annoying exasperating <a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1181249348824379393">interview</a> with a Bush-era Republican, shilling for Trump while trying to sound reasonable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html#a165734" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a165817"></a>More and more, news orgs are posting short bits of video to Twitter. It's growing, and that's imho good.  Further, Twitter has a good API and it's relatively stable and liberal. I've thought for a long time that their API is their big advantage. As a developer I'd like to see them do more with it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html#a165817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a165908"></a>Twitter is a new kind of TV news looking for the right user interface. I don't think Moments is the answer. I think Checkbox News is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html#a165908" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170008"></a>Here's the idea of <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/checkboxNews.html">Checkbox News</a> in an <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/07/checkboxNewsFullSize.png">image</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html#a170008" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170627"></a>I did this around the time Boris Yeltsin died and the Virginia Tech massacre. I want to watch the news while I work, or tweet while I watch the news, basically <i>news isn't the only thing I'm doing. </i>I want a bit of control over what flows through the video window. I got it, Yeltsin died. All the reports are starting to sound the same, so I uncheck it. No more news of Yeltsin. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html#a170627" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170212"></a>As media has progressed, we've learned that sometimes it's best to turn things on, and in other contexts that's too much work, I want others to do it for me, and then I need the ability to turn things off. TV news is most definitely in the latter category.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html#a170212" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170312"></a>With the flow that Twitter already has, if trusted news sources (a super important concept that should also be developed, not by Twitter) would add keywords to their video uploads, we could have Checkbox News running pretty quickly, maybe as early as next year. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html#a170312" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a161444"></a>I am lucky that the work I do can be done anywhere there's a net connection. So I've moved around quite a bit in the last 25 years. I started writing on the web in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_California">Silicon Valley</a> in 1994. In 2003 I moved to Cambridge, MA, then tried Seattle and the beach in northeast Florida (I had family there). I spent a few years in Berkeley, and then when my father died in <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/03/fathersDay.html">2009</a>, I moved back to NYC (where I was born and raised) to be near my rapidly shrinking family. When my mom passed away in <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/02/11/152545.html">2018</a>, I started looking for the next place, and this is where I landed.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/161106.html#a161444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
