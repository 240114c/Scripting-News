I ask because I found that something I pointed to, and embedded in my blog, that I felt was historic, was on an account that Twitter suspended. The tweet was no longer available. I understand why Twitter needs to suspend accounts, but do they have to get rid of all the previous posts? Does Twitter care about the web? Do they want to be part of it?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/10.html#a190648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I've settled on "founder," the term we use for people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. It's a term of greater respect, imho. I'm not finished contributing, that's why I care. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/10.html#a172934" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182622"></a>Former White House national security adviser <a href="https://www.axios.com/hr-mcmaster-trump-ukraine-election-interference-563335a9-070b-497c-b2e0-bc25dafba632.html">H.R. McMaster said</a> itâ€™s not appropriate for Trump to solicit foreign election interference, but that itâ€™s up to the American people to decide whether he did so with Ukraine. That seems fair to me. I vote yes, he did. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/10.html#a182622" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/04/25/fresca.png"><a name="a170953"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/04/25/fresca.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I had to do a lot of driving today and listened to two Daily podcasts back to back, which should be listened to together, imho. The first was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/podcasts/the-daily/impeachment-inquiry-democrats-republicans-kavanaugh.html">profile</a> of the Republican strategist who managed the Kavanaugh confirmation and who is now leading the impeachment defense for Repubs. It was infuriating, esp the way the Times reported it. In the second podcast they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/podcasts/the-daily/house-democrats-elissa-slotkin.html">followed</a> one of the pivotal Democratic reps, from Michigan, as she met with constituents at two town halls. The hot topic was impeachment. What was so fascinating is that you can hear, quite clearly, the result of the propoganda from the subject of the first podcast that is <s>informing</s> enraging the anti-impeachment voters. The rep was admirable, made me proud to be an American, a contrast to the first, who made me feel there's no hope for our country. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/10.html#a170953" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a123142"></a>NPR did it again. They repeated Trump's claim that the Kurds didn't help in World War II as if it were news, but it's not true.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/10.html#a123142" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
