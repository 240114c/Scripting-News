In your RSS feed, each &lt;item> should set the &lt;link> element to point at the landing page for the episode. Otherwise the only way to share your podcast is with a link to the MP3 which isn't good for you or them. You can see dozens of these items in my <a href="https://twitter.com/podc/">podc</a> account on Twitter. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/13.html#a171729" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We have to have a serious talk about this, because it reveals a side of Warren that is divisive and unacceptable. I'm sick of electing presidents who divide us into evil and not-evil. It's <i>the</i> sickness of our country. Honestly I don't care about marriage, anyone's marriage. I think marriage is an awful institution. It wrecked the family I grew up in. So no one has the high ground here as far as I'm concerned. And while I think Warren is the best candidate we have now, I think she needs to do some soul searching on this. If she is elected, it would be tragic if she does the same kind of BS that the Republicans do, and tries to make some Americans outcasts. After all, the question she was asked was about other people's <i>beliefs, </i>not their actions. And as president, her job would be to safeguard their rights, along with those of people she agrees with. As faculty at Harvard Law School I would think she would be steeped in that understanding, that it would run in her blood. The Constitution isn't just for people we agree with. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/13.html#a135827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a150857"></a>It happened with Obama, Hillary Clinton.  It was really humiliating because in both cases, I passionately wanted them to win, but not just the way Obama did, rather in a way that would lead to effective permanent organization of the electorate using networks. Every emailed request for money reminded me of what they thought of me. Give us money. Give us money. And give us money. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/13/150753.html#a150857" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I think <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/13.html#a135827">today's piece</a>, especially, is make-or-break for her campaign. To be doing so well up to this point and have the problem show up this early, is scary. I'm not sure that even if she wins, it'll be any better than Trump.
