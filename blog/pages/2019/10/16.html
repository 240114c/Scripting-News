How about a Democratic presidential candidate who runs as a conservative. That would blow a lot of minds imho. Here's the deal. Restore the American Revolution and the Constitution. Fix bugs in Obamacare, prepare for a national debate on further healthcare reform, to be discussed without a gun to our heads. Repeal the tax cuts passed by Republicans, they were an obvious corrupt act. Have to do something to punish the Repubs for Merrick Garland. Create a new foundation for respectful discourse in America. It's time for some honor and self-respect, America. You've been acting like a spoiled rich kid.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/16.html#a142657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a192136"></a>I'm on episode 8 of the final season of Breaking Bad, and I can now tell you why I cringe when people say it's the best TV show ever. I couldn't have said exactly why before. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/16/192128.html#a192136" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a192210"></a>I like all kinds of crime stories. I like Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction. The Godfather is the best movie ever made. The Maltese Falcon. The Departed. I love them all, and they all have one thing in common. The lead character is sympathetic. Tony Soproano is the mob boss who is seeing a shrink and has a neurotic wife whose approval he desperately wants. He's sympathetic. Would Succession be as good if Logan Roy wasn't proud of his son for being so awful? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/16/192128.html#a192210" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I absolutely hate Walter White. Every episode provides new reasons to hate him. That's the central idea of the show. How hateable can we make Walter White? I hate that so many sympathetic people die before he goes. Gus Fring was sympathetic. Mike Ehrmentraut. I forget all the characters who die (I'm going to re-discover them now). All his adversaries are sympathetic. But he's an absolute worst piece of shit he could possibly be <i>and the show is all about him. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/16/192128.html#a192346" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a192608"></a>One more thing. I'm a huge fan of Bojack Horseman. And his sidekick, like Gilligan to the Skipper, like Sgt Schultz to Col Klink, is <a href="https://bojackhorseman.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Chavez">Todd Chavez</a>. Who is played by Aaron Paul who plays Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad. And this time around, I hear Todd's voice when Jesse speaks. It's funny! Of course there's more overt satire in Bojack, even though I'm sure the Breaking Bad writers meant it to be funny in a hateful way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/16/192128.html#a192608" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a192733"></a>So I admire Breaking Bad. I am in awe of it, everything about it. But I also hate it because I have to focus on a character who I thoroughly despise. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/16/192128.html#a192733" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
