I was 14. Lived in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/29-31+170th+St,+Flushing,+NY+11358/@40.769637,-73.7970707,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c28a80780e9c3b:0xa8668e9b256999a4!8m2!3d40.769637!4d-73.794882">Flushing</a>, mowed the lawns of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets&t=h_&ia=web">Mets</a> players. Loved them when they lost, was rewarded for the trust. I’ve believed in miracles my whole life thanks to the example of the 1969 Mets. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a131116" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162944"></a>In 1995 I wrote a piece entitled <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#3">The Baseball God</a>. It was about two days. 1. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_World_Series#Game_5">day</a> the Mets won the World Series in 1969. 2. And the day of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake">Loma Prieta quake</a>, when the Giants were playing the A's in the World Series in San Francisco. I only realize now, 24 years later, that they were just one day apart, October 17 in 1989, and October 16 in 1969 (I'm writing this on October 17, 2019). Is the Baseball God sending us a message?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a162944" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There's now a <i>More</i> button at the bottom of the page, if you click it, you'll get another page from the Scripting News archive, going back as far as May 2017, when the current CMS came online. You can also vertically scroll past the end and it'll do it without you having to click the button. It's a little tricky because there's so much text at the bottom.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a161833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a130233"></a>If it ever happens that browsers refuse to browse <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">HTTP</a> sites, it's going to create a huge outage. Think about <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xwe9p/yahoo-groups-is-winding-down-and-all-content-will-be-permanently-removed">Yahoo Groups shutting</a> down in December and all the history that will go offline as a result. The web is huge, deep and <a href="http://scripting.com/autowebdocs/whatisautoweb_119.html">old</a>.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131803"></a>The web is like one of the big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_oak">live oak</a> trees in my yard in my old <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/425+Manzanita+Way,+Woodside,+CA+94062/@37.419135,-122.2471517,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa438d2e58d87:0x6c0dbc392cc6bf79!8m2!3d37.419135!4d-122.244963">Woodside, CA</a> house. Soaking in the hot tub, I would say to the nearby tree "I own you." It just laughs. If the tree could speak it would say: "I was here long before you, and I'll be here when you're gone." It's true, I sold the house in 2003. The house has been torn down, but the live oak trees are still there. That's the web. It's deep and broad. Try to break it, you might as well try to boil the ocean. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a131803" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125931"></a>I had a <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/25.html#a135230">bike accident</a> a little over 3 weeks ago. Broke a rib, am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGlo9LzmOME">getting</a> over it. It takes a long time for a rib to heal. This is the second time I've had the rib-breaking kind of bike accident. Last time I broke multiple ribs on both sides. This time it was only one rib but it really broke. I thought for a while I'd have to get surgery to repair it, but it's fixing itself. Makes breathing hard and sleep comes in spurts, I haven't slept through the night since it happened. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a125931" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
