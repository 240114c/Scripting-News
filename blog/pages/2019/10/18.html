<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140429"></a>I wish there were an Amy Klobuchar <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=klobuchar+action+figure&t=h_&iax=images&ia=images">action figure</a>. It should be a requirement for a serious presidential candidate. BTW, "action figure" is an adult-acceptable term for "doll." I like them because they have white backgrounds and therefore look good in the right margin of my blog. I'd accept a nicely-cropped publicity photo, or a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&sxsrf=ACYBGNRAn_hn0qhFy73cHX9vwDBSGIcSmA:1571407618476&q=site:scripting.com+trump+head&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjy4ZXH_aXlAhWswFkKHaO6BpAQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1139&bih=1119">disembodied head</a> like the ones I use for Trump.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18.html#a140429" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem"><a name="a145959"></a>Just noticed GitHub has a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/18/newGitHubHomePage.png">new</a> home page. A bit motivated by Twitter perhaps. I like where they're going. Can't stop to take a closer look right now, just thought it was worth a mention. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18.html#a145959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134616"></a><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/18.html">A year ago</a> I went digging around what remains of the <a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/">BloggerCon</a> website, <a href="http://this.how/bloggercon/">restoring</a> pieces like the <a href="http://scripting.com/archives/bloggerCon/I/participants/">participant list</a> and the <a href="http://this.how/bloggercon/#1539876200000">grids</a>. The first BloggerCon was 16 years ago, in 2003. It was the where the term <a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html">unconference</a> was coined. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18.html#a134616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a135910"></a>I always wonder why people disclaim that they don't like me before they point to something I've written as being relevant or important. So I won't tell you what I think of David Brooks. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/135442.html#a135910" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

He asks if it's Trump v Warren, who he, a moderate Republican, will vote for. I'll save you the suspense, it's Warren. Good, Brooks has a soul and isn't an idiot. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/135442.html#a135944" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140019"></a>Four years of Warren, who imho likely will be as ineffective a president as Jimmy Carter, is way better than four years of the accelerated lunacy of Trump. The United States, seriously, would not survive that. I don't think we'll survive another 1.5 years, which is why impeachment and removal is an urgent matter. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/135442.html#a140019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140058"></a>He says "If the party nominated one of those six, you really could see the Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence. You could see movement on a range of issues where large majorities are already stacked on one side: guns, climate change, reducing income inequality, expanding health coverage." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/135442.html#a140058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140134"></a>I agree. A lot of change would be possible with a centrist Democrat in the presidency, they might even be possible with Warren. I like the progressive ideas, and I think our chance of progress is better if we elect a moderate in 2020. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/135442.html#a140134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a163705"></a>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_goes_to_China">Nixon going to China</a>, something worth considering, a moderate Democrat could be more effectively progressive than Warren. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/135442.html#a163705" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

A very pivotal scene. Walt loses his money to the Nazis, of course Hank dies as does his friend Gomez. Walter White comes unglued. All logic says, based on previous Walter White choices, that Hank must die. The Nazi, Jack, knows it, Hank knows it. Hank, after hearing Walter offer the Jack $80 million to let Hank live, must have been touched, because his final words were: "You want me to beg? You're the smartest guy I ever met, and you're too stupid to see -- he made up his mind 10 minutes ago." It's a beautiful scene. And of course none of the events taking place wouldn't have happened if Walter weren't so blinded by his obsession with money, and his feelings about Jesse. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/171521.html#a171545" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
