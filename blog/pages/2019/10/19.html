	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a173347"></a>Most of the time Dropbox works, but today, sometime just after 11AM Eastern, it got flaky and basically stopped working. Usually it's something I did, so I started checking things out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html#a173347" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a173450"></a>I have two accounts, neither is close to out of space. One is using 178.85 GB of 2.1 TB. The other is using 11.68 GB of 2 TB.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html#a173450" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173540"></a>I thought perhaps my desktop computer wasn't synching. I tried creating a folder, and it took a very long time for it to show up in the dropbox.com file browser, but it did eventually show up. But it does not show up on the server it's intended for.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html#a173540" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173639"></a>My desktop computer says it's been synching for a couple of hours. That's when I started looking. Maybe it was going on a lot longer. I don't know. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html#a173639" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173756"></a>The way I first experienced the outage is that updates to the app I'm working on stopped appearing on the server. Before that I was making changes, and they'd take the usual amount of time, a few seconds, to appear on the server.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html#a173756" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173858"></a>I checked their <a href="https://status.dropbox.com/">status page</a>, and it says everything is good. I looked at the Dropbox support <a href="https://twitter.com/DropboxSupport">account</a> on Twitter, it says it's closed until Monday.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html#a173858" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a174142"></a>I'm kind of stuck. No idea what the problem is. Is it my problem? How can I tell. It doesn't seem like it, because if it were, all my desktop computers and servers would have to be experiencing the same problem. It could happen. But it doesn't seem likely.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html#a174142" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a141636"></a>They all work well and scale since they're static. I did one method that wasn't static, using XML-RPC. That method had problems as the installed base of Frontier grew. Static distribution is the way to go. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/141457.html#a141636" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a141750"></a>As I waited for a response to the <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/145319.html">query</a> about folder-level sync with a git repository, I went ahead with the brute force method, which works as follows.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/141457.html#a141750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li><a name="a141828"></a>When it's time to sync, first we clone the whole repo into a temp folder. Then compare the destination folder with the sub-folder of the downloaded repo, copy the new or changed files. Then delete the temporary repo.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/141457.html#a141828" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141950"></a>The assumption is that the repo is relatively small. We burn a bit of bandwidth and temporary disk space. And the job gets done. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/141457.html#a141950" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="a142019"></a>The overall system I'm working on will also support one-way sync with an S3 location and perhaps RSS-based delivery later. But right now having git-based distribution working, I can proceed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/141457.html#a142019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
