<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a211549"></a>I think a blog should be like an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Caen">Herb Caen</a> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/herbcaen/">column</a> in the SF Chronicle. A goings-on-around-town type flow of mostly gossip. Short items not essays. Caen's first columns were literally <a href="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/22/45/75/4874108/3/920x920.jpg">columns</a>.  I wonder if there are online columnists who use this style.

Eventually there will be a Murdoch version of Facebook, that’s what Zuck is trying to head off.

It fits perfectly in the door of a refrigerator. Fill the top with water, put the pitcher in the fridge. It takes a few minutes to filter the water. Next time you want a glass of cold water, just open the fridge and pour a glass. It has no taste. I used to drink bottled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poland-Springs-Bottled-16-9oz-Bottles/dp/B000CDHZEY/ref=sr_1_8?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrrXtBRCKARIsAMbU6bFGkQ7WYgMn0iV65rGZv2GbbLPiHjaxOhMqy5N7J0XH5J_RPQw0_TAaAgDNEALw_wcB&hvadid=282644276296&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1023481&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t3&hvqmt=e&hvrand=11878723364070780002&hvtargid=kwd-325874732562&hydadcr=4414_9619179&keywords=poland+springs+bottled+water&qid=1571692044&s=grocery&sr=1-8">Poland Springs</a> water, but I prefer this to the bottles.
