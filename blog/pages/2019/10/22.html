<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152609"></a>The <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html">Dropbox situation</a> has become more dire. I pretty much have to stop everything and reconceive how I work with my servers from my desktop. Something broke. I may have a workaround. The lesson is that when you depend on other people's tech, at some point it will fail, and then what will you do. It's hard to have a plan for this kind of outage. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/22.html#a152609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I can't read it because of their paywall, but it's an interesting subject. How about this -- negotiate it privately with McConnell. See if there's anything he could support.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/22.html#a162848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
