<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/14/mlk.png"><a name="a132902"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/14/mlk.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">We need a Wikipedia for news. A landing page for each story, with a summary, and pointer to coverage of all major news sites. As they all adopt paywalls I find it's hard to pick a good story to point to from pieces on my blog. Also I don't like pointing to news pages that are overloaded with crapware. Two bits of prior art. <a href="https://politicalwire.com/">Political Wire</a> and <a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/">Memeorandum</a>. I like Political Wire's synopses, and Memeorandum's accumulation of links and tweets. Merge those two ideas, and cover more than politics, that's the basic idea. And also use relatively future-safe server tech. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/23.html#a132902" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a184210"></a>We're having the fight to preserve the Constitution and rule of law, right now, today. It's debatable the extent to which the president is above the law, but certainly no one else is. Or are they? The Repubs are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/republicans-crash-secure-room-disrupt-testimony-in-impeachment-probe.html">testing</a> that today.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/23.html#a184210" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Every big news site should be an aggregator and compete with Facebook. I was pitching CNN on this in 2004, fifteen years ago.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/23.html#a170846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a132045"></a>After reading about <a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/191022/p100#a191022p100">Taylor’s testimony</a> it’s amazing that there are still people as competent, honest and brave in our government, esp one who was appointed by Pompeo. I was of the belief they had all been removed.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/23.html#a132045" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
