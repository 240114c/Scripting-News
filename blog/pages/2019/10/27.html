<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174903"></a>Very few people use the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/27/chatTabScreenShot.png">Chat tab</a>, so I took it out of the list of active tabs. I'm going to keep looking for the best form of interaction for blog readers. Right now, it seems to be Twitter. The software is still running and can be accessed at <a href="http://chat.scripting.com/">chat.scripting.com</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/27.html#a174903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a205651"></a>I'm trying to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_(TV_series)">The Spy</a> on Netflix, but I keep expecting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJZO5Hge2DY">Borat</a> to show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb3IMTJjzfo">up</a>. I'm watching for it. Anyway it's not that good. What is good that I found at random is the 1998 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Simple_Plan_(film)">A Simple Plan</a>. It got great reviews, but don't watch the trailer, it's a total spoiler.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a203441"></a>All is right with the world. The Knicks are 0-3. Some norms will never be broken, it seems. BTW, they say the last time the Knicks had a winning team was <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/11/13/jeremyLinWasACoralReef.html">2012</a>. Already a long time ago. Here's what happened in a <a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/02/25/meloLin.gif">single image</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/27.html#a203441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162943"></a>One of the many things wrong with our president is he never wins. He always feels he has to sell. Can you imagine, never a moment to relax, kick back, and savor your accomplishments?

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a204848"></a>I find that I can't watch Mike Pence on TV anymore. In my mind I've written him off. It's no longer Mike Pence season. I feel the same way about Mike Pence as I feel about Game of Thrones.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/27.html#a204848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
