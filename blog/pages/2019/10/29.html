<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/29/psychoKiller.png"><a name="a140306"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/29/psychoKiller.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A number of people in the town where I now live have blogs and do podcasts. It feels weird to me, so far from the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Columbus+Cir,+New+York,+NY/@40.7678762,-74.1215993,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258f63c9804b5:0xacca5e3d4112d7eb!8m2!3d40.767848!4d-73.9815219">center</a> of civilization, I guess there's a bit of pride, but mostly bewilderment. Like the guy who creates a new computer system in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine">Soul of  a New Machine</a> and sees someone using it and thinks you can't use this stuff. Heh. I don't play much of a role in these things anymore. Not sure I'd want to actually, though I think the software most people use for blogging is nowhere near as good or complete as what we had in the early 00s. Just a little factoring and UI reorg would make things flow much better. Podcasting has become a huge undertaking for people, with seasons and episodes, sponsors.  It should be imho like leaving a voice mail to a few friends. Nice thing is today it can easily scale up to millions of friends. That wasn't true at the beginning. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a140306" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153508"></a>I had <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/sunfrost-farms-woodstock">breakfast</a> last week with a new local <a href="https://twitter.com/markzip">friend</a> who reads this blog. He's a former DJ at <a href="http://www.radiowoodstock.com/">WDST</a>, and from that he <a href="http://www.zipsziggurat.com/">built</a> a business selling music at <a href="http://nyrecordfairs.com/">fairs</a> in the northeast. He was in the business when Napster rolled through. We shared some interesting stories. I told him what I had been hearing about <a href="https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/local-news/woodstock-site-of-wdst-and-bearsville-theater-sold-to-company/article_24d75aa4-ce5f-11e9-bdd4-db5cb1e71857.html">the</a> <a href="https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/09/06/bearsville-complex-has-a-new-owner/">sale</a> and <a href="https://bearsvillecenter.com/">reboot</a> of <a href="https://www.rhino.com/article/new-this-week-todd-rundgren-the-complete-bearsville-albums-collection">Bearsville</a> and Todd Rundgren's old studio and stage. British dude, his sports are rugby and soccer. Not much overlap with this NBA and MLB guy.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a153508" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O52jAYa4Pm8"><a name="a144717"></a>I was hoping podcasting would be more spontaneous and casual, sort of like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O52jAYa4Pm8">Talking Heads song</a> that goes like this: "When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed. Say something once, why say it again?" Of course I don't live up to that rule on my own blog. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a144717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a164734"></a>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/kyrie-irvings-volatility-makes-nets-officials-queasy/">reality of Kyrie</a> is sinking in for the Nets. I didn't used to care about the Nets, and I still don't, but I wonder why Kyrie thought we would? Their story is only interesting because of the drama. I would have preferred if they grew slowly. New York is a dysfunctional NBA city, btw, in case it wasn't obvious. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a164734" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162753"></a>I've been working on an SQL-based RSS <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+river6&t=h_&ia=web">aggregator</a> for a while. I just got it working with a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/">managed database</a> on Digital Ocean. That's a big deal because I don't want to manage databases. Now I don't have to? So far I like it though there were too many hoops to jump through for the setup. A Hello World app for Node with step by step instructions would have helped. Good docs is the thing that sets Digital Ocean apart from AWS. This time I have to say they could be better.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a162753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So from a distance you couldn't tell if it was one of his assholes or one of ours.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a233214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a235158"></a>I know this is blasphemy but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/10/11/michelle-obama-today-show-orig-acl.cnn">Michelle Obama</a> is wrong. We need rallying cries too, and demonstrations, and slogans. We've bottled up our anger, that's nice, but look where it's gotten us. What Trump's assholes are doing to America, <i>our country,</i> is unacceptable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a235158" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145218"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/bump">Robert Occhialini</a> is restoring his old blog and <a href="https://twitter.com/bump/status/1189179783722217473">reports</a> that one of the only links from November 1997 that still works is the old <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html">Frontier home page</a>. That was a good page, a lot of love was poured into it. But there was a broken image, I was immediately sure of the cause. The original server, a Mac, had unicase filenames. It's now hosted on S3 which has case-sensitive file names. So what worked when it was originally posted, now is broken, when served through S3. I guess it must be hard or impossible for S3 to offer unicase for HTTP requests. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a145218" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
