"The beauty of podcasting is that anyone can do it. It’s a rare medium that’s nearly as easy to make as it is to consume." Thank you. That was by design.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31.html#a164002" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a201147"></a>In today's podcast I talk about the 20th anniversary of the idea of podcasting. Not as soon as I thought: October 26, 2020. Having a <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/10/26.html">blog archive</a> is useful. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/31/podcastingCreationDay.png">screen shot</a> of the relevant bit.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31.html#a201147" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180158"></a>If the Repubs don't all work for Putin by now, they should be and probably are thanking the Dems, privately of course, for standing up for the co-equal branches idea at the heart of the Constitution. Without that their jobs would be meaningless. No power at all.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31.html#a180158" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The man who created it deserves respect for that. No one else did it. If anyone would minimize his accomplishment it would be me, but I'm in awe of it. Start there. How can we work together to get the most out of what he built.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31.html#a165523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155812"></a>I assume the NYT thinks that any ad that quotes the NYT is okay. But there are so many lies in the NYT. We need better grounding in truth before we can hold anyone else to only running truthful ads.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31.html#a155812" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142211"></a>In tweets today Trump is saying he's doing a good job as president. That's fair, they're half-truths and lies, but it's political speech so it doesn't have to be true. That is an American norm. The op-ed writers appear to not know this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31.html#a142211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They said the Democrats in 1998 had the same objection, which wasn't true, because then there was a special prosecutor, Ken Starr, who did his inquiry in private before issuing his public report. As far as I know the Democrats never said this inquiry should be held in public. Even if they had it wouldn't have been. There are rules about the process designed to protect the accused and the process. NPR never presented the other side, how this all looks from the point of view of the Democrats, or more importantly, the Constitution, which is really what Trump has offended. (Could they cover a story without it being totally and inappropriatey partisan?)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31/135808.html#a135842" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a140000"></a>This is why the hearings have been private. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31/135808.html#a140000" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140035"></a>Such inquiries are private to protect the accused because, if there is no indictment, they want to limit damage.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31/135808.html#a140035" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140106"></a>The Repubs also complained, through their NPR voice, that the president should have been given a chance to present his evidence. He <i>was</i> given the chance, and chose to try to obstruct the process instead of participating. Makes the Republican complaint seem hollow. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31/135808.html#a140106" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
