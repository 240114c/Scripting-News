A friend  posted a request for a referral to a cardiologist. A far-away friend was quite sick. We figured out that wasn't right, they should call 911 and get to a hospital asap. I don't know what the outcome was, but it might have saved a life.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/01.html#a142642" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a132509"></a>Most journalistic pieces about Facebook view it as an online bulletin board with nightmarish advertising that's getting worse every day. For what it's worth, that's not how I experience it. The only political ads i see are from Democratic candidates who want money. Harmless and easily ignored. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/01/131423.html#a132509" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

It's a very civil place where people do the kinds of things towns do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/01/131423.html#a132651" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132644"></a>There are quite a few Republicans, occasionally someone says something inflammatory about Trump, but that's moved out the main discussion quickly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/01/131423.html#a132644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132743"></a>I think people have an interest in civility because eventually you'll see most of them face-to-face, at the post office, grocery, in a park, on the new rail trail, a local restaurant, party. That is a real force for civility. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/01/131423.html#a132743" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132834"></a>Anyway, there's no question that it works, and it's worth it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/01/131423.html#a132834" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a150556"></a>I know it's in a silo, against my religion, but on the other hand, it's where the people are. Some things are more important than silos vs open systems. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/01/131423.html#a150556" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132921"></a>So when journalists write about FB as if it's a black and white thing, they aren't really doing their job. And their editors don't create room for other views, and they aren't doing their jobs either. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/01/131423.html#a132921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
