<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/05/dems.png"><a name="a210110"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/05/dems.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I think Sherrod Brown or Amy Klobuchar would be good Democratic candidates for president. I listened to today's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/podcasts/the-daily/whos-ahead-2020.html">Daily podcast</a> about the chances of the Demo candidates based on polling the NYT just did. It's not a good picture. They say Biden would win, but the Repubs haven't run a campaign on him yet. They're going to let the Dems tear him to shreds first, which they will. People think this is about policy, it's not. <i>People want to feel like winners. </i>I wouldn't feel like a winner, of any kind, if my president was Warren, Sanders or Biden. Ugh. Anyway if a Democrat is elected what they'll do will depend totally on the makeup of Congress. The more Repubs are left the more compromise, unless of course Trump is re-elected, then you can forget about who's in Congress, it won't matter. Our Congress will be no more consequential than Russia's. I agree with <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/poll-trump-beats-democrats-swing-state-biden-warren-sanders.html">Chait</a> that the Dems have been living in a fantasy world. None of the leading candidates will beat Trump, none of them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/05.html#a210110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a150949"></a>So much discussion in the news about impeachment, and they never talk about the #1 reason to impeach, asap. So here's a reminder.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/05/150942.html#a150949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a151024"></a>He's running the presidency as if he was a monarch. Ignoring the Constitution. And the longer he gets away with it the worse it gets. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/05/150942.html#a151024" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153845"></a>They should make a song about this. How the president is not a king. We could change the words to the Star Spangled Banner. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/05/150942.html#a153845" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
