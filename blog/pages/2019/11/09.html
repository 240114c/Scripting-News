<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a193621"></a>As a newbie in town, I have basic questions like where to shop for <a href="http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1550086702000">groceries</a>, ride the <a href="http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1550336098000">bike</a>, look at the <a href="http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1573313656000">stars</a>, which <a href="http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1551967188000">airport</a> to fly out of -- really basic stuff.  I usually post the question in the private Facebook group for the town. I keep an <a href="http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml?format=opml">outline</a> of some, not all of the questions and the best advice, <a href="http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml">on this.how</a>. It's for things that aren't blog posts, stories I want to come back to, edit, refine, add to. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a193621" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150932"></a>Did a little prototyping for the <i>tweetsucker</i> project I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/07.html#a144614">about</a> the other day, and noted that the Twitter API <a href="https://github.com/reneraab/node-twitter-api">toolkit</a> that I use is now marked as not maintained. It still works, but It seems this is something Twitter ought to maintain, or pay someone to maintain. Letting this fall out of sync with the actual API wouldn't be very good. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a150932" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was sure the Knicks would be blown away. What a surprise to wake up to find out <i><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/ntilikina-gem-in-win-over-porzingis-could-be-knicks-turning-point/">the Knicks won</a>. </i>I don't think anyone was humiliated, but there's a sadness when you realize how great the team could be now if KP hadn't demanded a trade, had found a way to work with the Knicks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's supposed to be a 2008 picture of Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Clinton. The only thing that would make it better is if Jeffrey Epstein were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photobombing">photobombing</a>. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a134623" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
