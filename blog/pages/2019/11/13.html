Lots of zipped files in various formats.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a204458"></a>If the Repubs in the Senate vote to leave the criminal in the White House that's probably okay because that's the end of the Republican Party.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131727"></a><a href="https://protocol.com/">Protocol</a> is a new tech pub from the publisher of Politico. Launching in early 2020. They announced it in a Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/politico-founder-is-launching-a-tech-site">piece</a> (paywall, lots of noisy dialogs). I'm in tech, have been reading tech pubs for almost 40 years. It's been a long time since one was worth reading, sad to say. But wouldn't it be cool if this one was different? They have a great web address. Why not start out with a blog about the creation of the pub, and when they're up and running it could transition to their "public editor" function. Take criticism from readers, new perspectives. I know it's weird but I expect tech pubs to make good use of the tech. I'd also like to know who's writing for them, the Vanity Fair piece doesn't have that info. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/13.html#a131727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

At least it affords the Democrats the chance to do that.

Oh the epic vacuousness of their diatribe. After an insipid idea is completely exhausted, they repeat it.  Once I finished vomiting in the waste basket, I decided I had to <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1194610096560582658">tweet</a> about it.
