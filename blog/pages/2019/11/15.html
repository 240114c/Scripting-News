<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a204320"></a>How fucked is the United States? Let's find out! There should be hearings <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ambassador+yovanovitch+testifies&t=h_&iar=news&ia=news">like this</a> for years, covering the corruption of the Trumps. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/15.html#a204320" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

What is the monthly fee? And what is it behind the paywall? Tech journalism is basically nonexistent these days. It does not actually appear to be a competitor of Facebook/Twitter, more like Reddit.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/15.html#a202706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a123932"></a>I'm glad that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> is getting <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2019/11/carmelo-anthony-signs-with-portland-trail-blazers-on-1-year-deal-report.html">another chance</a>. He was the face of the Knicks for many years. I was surprised to find that even though his attitude about himself and the team was the source of a lot of the Knicks' problems, after he was gone, I felt affection for him. I look forward to seeing him play for Portland and I hope the team and the fans give him a chance to get settled in. He's more than a player, he's part of the soul of the NBA. There's no doubt when he returns to the Garden with his new team, there will be a huge outpouring of affection for him. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/15.html#a123932" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124548"></a>BTW, amazingly, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/kristaps-porzingis-learns-how-the-garden-treats-its-traitors/">Knicks beat Kristaps</a> and his new team <i>again</i> last night, this time in New York.

Here's the deal. Everything the president does not only benefits him personally but it also benefits Russia. All of it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/15/130321.html#a130335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a130344"></a>So more than an impeachment, we are hearing a case study about how the Republican Party and the American president are servants of a foreign adversary. A truth most of us find hard to accept, I guess. But there's a lot more of this than has come to light. This is just the first that has been so microscopically exposed. Expect that when we peer into the Turkish invasion of Kurdistan, we will find another clusterfuck of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">your favorite country</a> and mine. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/15/130321.html#a130344" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
