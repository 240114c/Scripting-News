<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a164314"></a>American journalism is never far from falling back to the horse race in everything. Who the hell knows or cares how many senators will ultimately vote to remove. It's impossible to know, or even if the vote will ever happen. Waste of time to speculate. And it isn't even up to the senators, it's up to the voters. The senators will vote to remove if it means they feel they will lose their election. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/21.html#a164314" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141319"></a>"The Three Amigos" is now part of American political folklore after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/live-blog/nov-20-impeachment-hearings-live-updates-n1086301/ncrd1086906#liveBlogHeader">Sondland said</a> he was proud to be an amigo. You can say you were there when this happened. Also this scandal doesn't have a short name, like Watergate, Iran-Contra. I guess the Clinton impeachment didn't get a name either. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/21.html#a141319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm overloaded, watching the impeachment hearings and at the same time dealing with a server that Dropbox fails on. Moving these apps to a new server is tricky.
