Explore every nook and cranny of Republican corruption. Target Repub senators up for re-election in 2020. Draft articles of impeachment are posted publicly and kept current, registered voters can vote individual articles up or down. A full week of hearings on why Republicans are repeating Russian talking points. How about the July 4 visit to Moscow by senators. Why are Repubs so beholden to Putin? What happened in Helsinki? So many questions. Letâ€™s get the answers.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/23.html#a130721" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150625"></a>Occam's Razor says if you want to grok the hows and whys of the Republican Party,  look at how the political system of Russia works. Why do the members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assembly_(Russia)">Russian legislature</a> do whatever Putin wants? That's why the Repubs do what Trump wants. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/23.html#a150625" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The nearest department store is about 40 minutes away and it's a Walmart, not exactly my favorite place to shop. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html#a125423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a125453"></a>In the last week the UPS driver on my route decided not to deliver to my house. The reason keeps changing, but it seems there's nothing I can do about it, so I gave up. I asked the UPS people in Kingston to return the packages to Amazon. I expect Amazon will refund the purchase price. They're usually pretty good with that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html#a125453" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a125531"></a>There are no Amazon lockers nearby. But UPS has a relationship with the hardware store in town (8 minutes from my house). That's going to be my next approach. To see if there's a way for UPS to deliver my packages to the store. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html#a125531" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a125604"></a>And while the UPS people I've talked with have been professional overall this leaves a really bad feeling here for UPS. One day they deliver to your house and the next day they don't. Whatever the reason (it keeps changing) it's not cool. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html#a125604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
