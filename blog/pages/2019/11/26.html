Every story ends with the same puzzle. Why does Trump love Russia? We don't know. We just don't know. It's like the line in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Harry_Met_Sally...">Harry Met Sally</a> where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55VPeDVxsrg">Carrie Fisher</a> says "He'll never leave her, I know, I know he'll never leave her." Everyone says it at some point. We can recite it along with them. "No one thinks he'll ever leave her," says Meg Ryan. At some point you hope she gets the clue. Everyone but the reporters knows why Trump loves Russia. At some point it would be useful if the reporters would just use it in their reporting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/26.html#a192004" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Yes there must be lines, don't joke about things people have no control over, as in body shaming. But if we can't laugh at ourselves and our foibles, well what's the point of living. We are really small and live infinitesimally short lives. That's the big joke connecting all the individual ones. We don't really matter in the end. If you've ever had someone you're close to die, you know that truth. We're only here for the moment, so <i>let's have fun. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/26.html#a151419" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a142257"></a>This is something I used to do in the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22morning+coffee+notes%22&t=h_&ia=web">early days</a> of the blog. When I started work in the morning, I'd create a section for the first notes of the day. It's nice because it leaves room at the top of the page as the day goes on, and I don't have to shuffle the morning stuff off to new places.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/26/142238.html#a142257" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
