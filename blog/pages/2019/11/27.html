You wouldn't know if you (like me) are not in his base. They showed a graph with the money spent by various Democrats on FB ads. In total it's small fraction of what Trump is spending. Now I think about Bloomberg's entry into the race in a whole new way. Not only is he rich, and can afford to spend a lot on ads, he also understands tech and media. That's how he made his billions. So when people count him out based on today's polling, they're getting caught in horse-race thinking and forgetting to look at the horse itself. He won't be afraid to use Facebook. He'll have some catching up to do, but he has a mind for tech media and lots of unique experience. Trump should be concerned. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/27.html#a201206" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

My concern was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">linkrot</a>. Twitter accounts are websites, we point to them and include them, as I point to the new Twitter policy above. Jack was around when the web was very young. The idea is that we're creating a record. It's not ephemeral. It should survive us. It shouldn't matter if a site is active. Now we know that <i>users care</i> about preserving the web. Twitter is part of that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/27.html#a195807" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
