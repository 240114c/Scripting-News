Their <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-16-04">docs</a> tend to be pretty good, and I desperately want to be able to manage servers using a Mac and a Finder-like interface.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/29.html#a155315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uWCNHQgfnc"><a name="a162616"></a>I had a thought that <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-irishman">The Irishman</a> might have been a better viewing and story-telling experience, and cheaper to make, if they had used the same technique as <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/undone/season-1">Undone</a>. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uWCNHQgfnc">the trailer</a> to give you an idea. A stylized graphic rendering of real footage. It has an animated look, but it's actual actors' voices and faces.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/29.html#a162616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155429"></a>Updates on bingeing. Couldn't get into the last season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)">Man in High Castle</a>. Might try again. Instead, I watched a few episodes of the first season of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Larry_Sanders_Show">Larry Sanders Show</a> on HBO. I had heard it mentioned on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/11/778304093/judd-apatow-on-his-mentor-comic-garry-shandling">Fresh Air</a> a couple of weeks ago, and it was totally worth it. How great is a comedy show that actually both holds your interest and gets you to laugh out loud. Next up: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zen_Diaries_of_Garry_Shandling">The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/29.html#a155429" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/29/whiteRussian.png"><a name="a160110"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/29/whiteRussian.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">My favorite binges are multi-season dramas with great writing and acting, and a vision from the show runner. Few series are so great that they check all the boxes, but some do. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire">The Wire</a> was the best of all time. Mad Men had a very strong vision, but the quality of story-telling was spotty, as was Breaking Bad. Deadwood, what a great show, but it ended before it got to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota#19th_century">punchline</a>. I like intense political drama and crime stories that get you into the characters. So I'm considering re-watching a few <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls049563664/">HBO miniseries</a> that got to me the first time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Kitteridge_(miniseries)">Olive Kitteridge</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Of">The Night Of</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(miniseries)">Mildred Pierce</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/29.html#a160110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161506"></a>Also if you haven't seen the several seasons of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series)">Fargo</a>, as a TV series, go for it. It's not a replay of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(film)">movie</a>, which of course is wonderful, rather it is a series of stories told in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fargo,+ND/@46.854112,-101.3112844,6z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x52c8cb8d84677145:0x81aa30a52791aaca!8m2!3d46.8771863!4d-96.7898034">FargoLand</a>, with some overlap in plot and characters. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/29.html#a161506" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
