<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a175338"></a>There's no doubt we have crossed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/27/climate-emergency-world-may-have-crossed-tipping-points?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">tipping point</a> in the climate crisis. Part of the equation is politics. We're not only not doing anything to halt the crisis, we're accelerating it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01.html#a175338" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a163417"></a>Watched a bit of the Sunday news, and listened to NPR. Lots of Republican lies. Enough with the news that gives more than half the time to lies to keep less than half the population in line. We're deep in a hole, and need a landslide in next year's election to have any hope of turning things around. The press as usual has a bias toward keeping everything disorganized because that gives them the horse race, one of two stories they know how to cover. (The other is Watergate.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01.html#a163417" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They would have to wear outfits and have interesting names and powers. Bezos would be the guy who can get anything delivered to you when you want it. Not sure what Gates' superpower would be.  It would be a lot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy">Idiocracy</a>. This movie would anticipate the future of the species when the evolution we're currently going through has run its course. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01.html#a170639" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a171759"></a>At a dinner last night with local friends, a question came up -- What is Digital Ocean? I <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22digital+ocean%22&t=hz&ia=web">mention them</a> in my posts and the nightly email. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01/172830.html#a171759" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173922"></a>I realllly like that people read my blog even if they don't know what everything means. This is one of the big <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22ignore+what+you+don%27t+understand%22&t=hz&ia=web">principles</a> of the net -- ignore what you don't understand. But read it anyway, over time unfamiliar ideas do sink in. I was tired and too much under the influence of <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/29/214440.html">White Russians</a> last night to attempt the answer. I'll try now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01/172830.html#a173922" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a172911"></a>Think of Digital Ocean as a giant warehouse of personal computers. You can rent one of the computers for about $20 a month, and put software on the computer, even stuff that I write myself. This is a big deal because the ability to run software "in the cloud" used to be something only employees of big companies could do. Now anyone can. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01/172830.html#a172911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173005"></a>Unlike my house in the woods their computers are less likely to lose power or their net connection. Also their warehouse is in a place where your computers, and your phone, can access it. I don't want thousands of people connecting to the computers in my house. It's a security thing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01/172830.html#a173005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173031"></a>So I pay them money and they run the server for me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01/172830.html#a173031" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173041"></a>Over the years, as you might imagine, the cost goes down and the power goes up. A lot. They have competition, so that helps keep the price down and performance up. I like Digital Ocean because their software and docs are good, and I just like the company. They are by far <i>not</i> the biggest company in this space, all the major tech companies compete, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, IBM. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01/172830.html#a173041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a174134"></a>PS: This is not an ad. I pay full price for my Digital Ocean servers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01/172830.html#a174134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
