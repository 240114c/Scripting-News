She's the leader we didn't know we had. What I admire most about her is her clarity and her ability to think on her feet. Either that or she really prepared for this moment. No matter, she's just what we need right now. A strong woman to stand up to Trump. That's his Kryptonite. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/06.html#a151307" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165940"></a>McKinsey is a management consulting company.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153404"></a>Important to note the role journalism was ready to play in the Trump plot to throw the 2020 election. <a href="https://www.axios.com/fareed-zakaria-zelensky-vlodymyr-cnn-trump-probe-aff098a1-963f-466b-9572-14f767ebb4e7.html">Fareed Zakaria</a> of CNN would interview Ukraine president Zelensky, where he would say they were investigating "The Bidens" for corruption. From there, Trump would ask repeatedly, as with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22hillary%27s+emails%22+site%3Ascripting.com&t=hz&ia=web">Hillary's emails</a> what's the deal, or they're under investigation or his favorite "I don't know but people are saying." That's all that would be needed to keep the "story" alive in American journalism. Biden's rep is already tainted. In software we'd consider this a serious vulnerability, and we'd close it asap before our servers were infected again, but journalism just lumbers along oblivious, happy to be used this way. Fake stories don't just enter through the web, Facebook and Twitter, sometimes they enter through the thought-to-be-pure methods of American journalism. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/06.html#a153404" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He and I of course are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers">boomers</a>. So is Trump and Rudy G. They were both born a decade before me. Their experience and values are vastly different from mine. There aren't many things you can say about boomers that's true of all boomers except for the period in which we were born (1946-1964) and our parents had sex and a few months later we were born (just like you btw). We come in all sizes and shapes. Some have penises, others have vaginas. Some are black others are white, others are Native American, some are children of Holocaust survivors, and others are Nazis. So many things to say about this, but most importantly the only way we get out of this mess is if we <i>work together. </i>The rest of it is stuff your parents should have taught you. If they're boomers, go ahead and blame them, but don't blame me. I'm not your father. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/06.html#a145024" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
