I just booted up an old Wii on my modern 4K video setup. It looks very rough. I also have a Switch that I'm going to set up. I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports">Wii Sports</a>. I don't think they have anything like that for Switch. Plain simple bowling, golf, tennis, baseball, etc?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/13.html#a185111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a140303"></a>If you think of the United States as a company, we've had a strategic partnership with Russia for the last three years, kind of like the one Microsoft had with IBM. Russia is analogous to Microsoft. They're about to roll over us in the 2020 election. Our last gasp is the impeachment. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/13/135739.html#a140303" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Going back to the Electoral College vote in 2016. We could have briefed the electors on the misdeeds of the Trump campaign in collusion with Russia. We could have had nightly <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/16/december19IsABigDay.html">candlelight vigils</a> in the state capitals where the electoral votes would be cast. We could have at least honored the passing of a political system that kind of worked and provided us with an incredible standard of living, and hosted the development of the Internet, won the space race, and Woodstock and the Mets! Saved my family. I wouldn't exist without the US and probably neither would you. We could have been serious about resisting right from that point, instead as with all the points at which we could have acted, we hoped somehow this would blow over without us having to disrupt our lives. We're a lazy, fat culture, Russia knows and is taking full advantage. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/13/135739.html#a140354" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140523"></a>Anyway back to the tech analogy. Impeachment is like IBM shipping OS/2 and the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=micro+channel+architecture&t=h_&ia=web">Micro Channel Architecture</a>. Both were designed to rid IBM of Microsoft once and for all. But it didn't work. It was too little too late. Microsoft came out with Windows 3.0, and IBM became a global consulting company. The company that dominated the computer business left the computer business. With the US and Russia analogy substitute "computer business" with "democracy business."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/13/135739.html#a140523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140633"></a>Impeachment is the last gasp bet that the rule of law still works, even though the Supreme Court has been stuffed with Russian puppets, as has the Senate. The only places that are still following the rule of law is the House and parts of the Department of Justice. Think of it as a two party system about to become one party. The one that prevails in impeachment will have the right to anihilate the other, and must do it.  There may still be a few courageous defectors to the Rule-of-Law Party, but unless there's a great awakening in the Senate, the courts, DoJ, the military and other branches of service, Putin has the power to put down impeachment, and from there, will complete the replication of the political system of Russia in the US, where political opponents are jailed or assassinated, as with uncooperative journalists. This is about to happen in the US, but journalism and discourse on the net has yet to catch up.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/13/135739.html#a140633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140912"></a>Putin could really fuck with us (but probably won't), and instruct McConnell to have a change of heart and the Senate votes to remove Trump. What an opportunity to screw up the US for a few generations, if not longer. From this point we're never going to know what's actually going on, we don't really know now (btw), but it's going to get a lot worse. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/13/135739.html#a140912" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
