<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a173548"></a>Long ago I made a "long bet" and <a href="https://twitter.com/longnow/status/1206613725005963264">won</a>. The bet was whether or not the NYT would continue to make their product freely available on the web. I figured no matter how much they tried, they would wall it off. They still haven't solved the problem. I think they could adopt the philosophy of open source tech billionaires. Make the product free and provide a supported version (whatever that means in news) for a price. This idea has been the foundation of all businesses ever started around software, because like news, there is no physical manifestation of our work, it's all in the arrangement of bits in computer memory. The biggest fortunes of our lifetimes have been made in commercializing those bits. Both hard to believe and true. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16.html#a173548" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144127"></a>I generally do not update iTunes, iPhones or iPads unless I've bought a new Apple product that requires I do so. I am never updating Mac OS because I'm running the last version that runs the OPML Editor, which I use for mission-critical work. The only must-have feature Apple has introduced for Mac OS in the last 20 years is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250">Time Machine</a>. Everything else as far as I'm concerned is optional. Of course I will get spattered with email from people who couldn't live without X, Y or Z. I salute you in advance. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16.html#a144127" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144347"></a>That said I would <i>kill</i> for a Linux version of the <a href="http://home.opml.org/">OPML Editor</a>. Then I could just use that OS, the same one I run on my servers and that would significantly simplify life. I am willing to kick in money for the port. We've never figured out a way to do that, but I just wanted to put that out there. Ted Howard is managing the <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html">releases</a> for the OPML Editor (it's a distro of UserLand Frontier). I am forever grateful for Ted for his work on this. It has made all my work much smoother. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16.html#a144347" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145220"></a>I have a box of backup disks from my career going back to the early 80s. I would like to start backing them up if I can. I think I have a CD drive that can read the backups from the 90s, but the earlier disks which are in various size floppy disks and Iomega disks will be more problematic. Starting to <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1206589087253176323">think</a> about how I want to approach this. My goal is to get the content of the disks up to Amazon S3 or something like that.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16.html#a145220" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They have a hidden feature that changes everything when managing domains, which is what they do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html#a170216" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170233"></a>Here's the feature. They let you put a CNAME where an A record is called for.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html#a170233" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170248"></a>In other words you can use a pointer where previously you could only use a hard-coded address. This makes it possible to switch hardware without having to keep track of every DNS-based reference to it. You can point through a pointer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html#a170248" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170326"></a>There's no reason not to do this. Their server is going to respond to every request, so they can do a database lookup to find out what IP address goes with the CNAME and return that. All transparently to the requester.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html#a170326" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170347"></a>When someone told me this works, I didn't believe it at first. Now it saves my ass all the time. A feature that every DNS system should support. It's the best kind of feature, it doesn't increase the complexity of the software, and it gives the user more leverage. The rare feature with no tradeoff. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html#a170347" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a165157"></a>A number of years ago I set up a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&t=h_&ia=web">new app</a> called <a href="http://1999.io/">1999.io</a> to run my blog. Interesting project, another look at the functionality of Manila, shipped in 1999, this time in the world of JavaScript and Node, with Facebook's UI as prior art. Last time I worked in this area Facebook didn't exist. Say what you want about them, their UI is innovative. Good ideas there. "Only steal from the best," I say.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/165143.html#a165157" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a165523"></a>I feel 1999.io was and still is a significant improvement over what was there before, WordPress, Facebook, Tumblr, Ghost etc. Still works, but <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">in 2017</a>, I moved to another model, most like the one I used before Manila, based on an outliner, and have used it ever since. But of course I left the 1999.io site where it was. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/165143.html#a165523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a165624"></a>This isn't goodbye, 1999.io still runs, people still use it. Like a lot of things in a Twitter/Facebook dominated world, writing tools tend to languish on the sidelines. I still hope to change that, I have some ideas. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/165143.html#a165624" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
