It's like Lost meets Westworld meets The Leftovers. Almost done with season one. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/22.html#a021647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a164234"></a>I've noticed recently that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpjtCv4vMGA&feature=youtu.be">expanding an embedded tweet</a> is painfully slow the first time you do it on an item on the blog. I did a bit of debugging and found the bottleneck, and fixed it. So now clicking on a wedge to view a tweet should be instantaneous. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/22.html#a164234" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a203414"></a>I asked my friend Allen Holub what "Agile" means. He had a <a href="https://holub.com/what-is-agile-the-elevator-pitch/">blog post</a> from 2017 ready to go. Wow. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/22.html#a203414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180719"></a>An odd thought. The Republicans are trying to eliminate rule of law. At the same time they're rushing to appoint judges. If they're successful, judges are just people, their opinions don't matter. Why do they care so much about judges then. Also, suppose the Supreme Court says his tax returns must be released. What does he do? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/22.html#a180719" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154226"></a>The thing in tech that sucks the most. A product everyone uses won't add a feature that would open it up to new ideas by independent devs. So you have to reimplement the whole thing, and convert their user base, to try out a new idea. Which means the new idea never gets tried out. First experience was MS-DOS and its lack of a clipboard in 1985. The OS had to be scrapped, effectively, because it never adapted to the more-than-one-app-at-a-time model, even though developers were achieving great success with that model.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/22.html#a154226" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In the last week, we finished the first round, and now there are new matchups, and public opinion matters in a whole new way. And guess what, on CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC -- they keep saying the same tired and wrong things they were saying last week and the week before. It's just a horse race to them. Nothing matters but the election in November 2020. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/22.html#a151049" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

"If a Senator has said how they will vote publicly on impeachment before the trial, and said evidence doesnâ€™t matter, can the other side ask Chief Justice to strike them from the jury?"<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/22.html#a151937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
