<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162029"></a>Okay I'm in Season 3 of <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/27.html#a135542">The Newsroom</a> now, and I bet  Sorkin isn't writing it, rather it's someone trying to write like Sorkin. It's awful. Unbearable. What would make sense is a final massacre like the end of Scarface. I'd pay to watch that. Say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVQ8byG2mY8">hello</a> to my little friend. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/30.html#a162029" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I no longer am going to care about whether the world is headed off a cliff. I'm no longer going to care about anything I can't do anything about and guess what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6rE0EakhG8">I feel <i>great</i></a> now. What a relief. You know what this feels like. When I got home after life-saving emergency heart surgery in 2002 I felt like I was in a dead relative's house. Something I had experienced a few times by then. This was someone else's house. Less than a year later I sold the place and moved to Cambridge where we started BloggerCon and the podcast movement, and what a great move that was. Giving up is the best thing to do. I mean it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/30.html#a153444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
