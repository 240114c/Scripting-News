<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160552"></a>The thing that was so frustrating about the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/amp/article/156096/death-good-internet-inside-job-decade-hell">piece</a> from Jason Linkins in the New Republic is that he is the kind of user we need on the open web. They see it as we deserted them, but as a developer who needs smart driven creative and friendly users, when you guys left, and decided to pour your brilliance into Twitter and Facebook instead, you helped drive the downward spiral. <i>Users matter. </i>That's the thing I've never been able to communicate to users. Stop being sheep. Choose. It may be a little harder, you may have to give up some features at first, but if you support a creative individual developer, you could be amazed at the new power they can and will create for you. Work with developers who make tools you like. Help them.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/06.html#a160552" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a194259"></a>Sometimes on FB people say the kind of stuff you hear on CNN from opinioneers whose job it is to say something even when there isn't anything to say. You listen to these people, and it's just a word salad of non-sentences that have absolutely no meaning. Then the host that you somewhat admire (e.g. Tapper, Melber) says that's an excellent point, Pete or that gets you thinking Gloria, and you realize they're just filling time with words that really have no meaning, and you're just wasting your time, you could learn more watching a Law & Order rerun for the 18th time. At least they're getting paid to do it. But on FB, there's just no call for it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/06.html#a194259" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a153053"></a>Open <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in its own browser window. This makes it easier to go back and forth, which we're going to have to do several times. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/06/153015.html?title=sharingOnFacebook#a153053" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
