<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165141"></a>There was a great New Yorker article in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/26/president-trumps-first-term?verso=true">September 2016</a> that laid out what a Trump presidency would be like. We need to do that again. We're staring at the next level. What if Trump succeeds at fully taking over the government? What if he's acquitted? What will that be like?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/18.html#a165141" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The right way is to wait until the day is over and read all of it from top to bottom. That's the way I put it together. It's a daily cycle thing. For now <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">subscribe</a> to the email. We may need a new kind of reader that doesn't have the limits of email (I'm well aware of them, having written my own email distribution software) and RSS (ditto).  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/18.html#a153502" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152721"></a>I've heard a dozen reports about the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/15/robert-hyde-lev-parnas-099511">mystery</a> of how Parnas's friend knew the ambassador's movements and no one has said it could be because someone hacked her Google account via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a>. You don't have to infiltrate the embassy to do that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/18.html#a152721" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152241"></a>Plot for a scifi book. An alien race from a faraway galaxy visits earth. We know they're coming and where they'll land. When they show up, they walk by the humans and greet the dogs. Turns out dogs are the master species of earth. And of course the aliens are canines as well.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/18.html#a152241" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153204"></a>People are cackling over the design of the <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/17/space-force-offers-first-peek-new-camouflage-uniform.html">Space Force uniform</a>. Why do they need camouflage in space? Obviously it's not really a priority. I'm a big believer in <a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod">prior art</a>, and there's an obvious choice here. License the design of the Star Trek uniforms from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS">whoever</a> owns them. It has the advantage of looking vaguely futuristic, and it makes Star Trek downright <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=prescient">prescient</a>. That is if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force">Space Force</a> ever amounts to anything. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/18.html#a153204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
