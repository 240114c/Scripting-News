I explain in this <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/22/outliningForThe20s.m4a">25-minute cast</a> what I'm doing here and why I value the connection with Doc. It's all about creating a groove with smart people so we can keep innovating. We used to call it (as I'm sure Doc remembers) "users and developers party together." I thrive off collaboration with people such as Doc. I provide examples of other times I've benefited from the insights of others to create new uses for networks.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/22.html#a182243" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a223957"></a>The nightly email is available as an <a href="http://scripting.com/rssNightly.xml">RSS feed</a>. However I'm sure it's going to look pretty awful because, unlike email, RSS readers don't allow us to include styles. I could of course add the style definitions to the <a href="http://source.scripting.com/">source namespace</a>, where I've put my customizations. If you're an RSS user, give it a try and let me know.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/22.html#a223957" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155110"></a>This is amazing. I read a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/22/nyPostOnFairway.png">story</a> at the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/01/21/fairway-planning-to-file-for-chapter-7-bankruptcy-will-close-all-stores/">NY Post</a> saying <a href="https://www.fairwaymarket.com/">Fairway</a> is filing for Chapter 7. It's a much-loved grocery chain in NYC. I posted a link <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1142456555961748">on Facebook</a>, because I know a few people who go there and got a link to a <a href="https://twitter.com/FairwayMarket/status/1219991753752707072">Twitter post</a> from the company saying they're fine, no plans to shut down. Can't wait to find out what happened here. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/22.html#a155110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
