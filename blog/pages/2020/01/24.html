I don't care. I have a motto. "Don't slam the door on the way out." That way you know you really are going in peace, vs the passive-aggressive control freakery you're actually practicing. Now suppose for the sake of argument, I try to make you happy and dump every political idea I have. Great. You're happy. You feel powerful. But then someone else wants me to stop writing about tech ideas that come to me, because it makes them feel inferior because last week I posted one they didn't understand. Keep going, eventually there's nothing left here. So, I've been doing this for over 25 years. By now I've heard from every control freak on the planet. Heh probably not, but it feels that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/24.html#a185839" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If the Dems had run ads like this in 2016, Trump would be a Fox News analyst today, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin">Sarah Palin</a>.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/24.html#a204258" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135848"></a>I got a couple of reports from people who use the Mail app on iPhones to read the <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly email</a>. The contents of the mail only fills a portion of the window horizontally.  I am able to reproduce the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/24/emailLooksCrappy.png">problem</a> here. Apparently previously it filled the space. I've started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/146">thread</a> to gather info about this. I don't know how to debug this, but I will try. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/24.html#a135848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a190905"></a>We, as a world, should build one great venue for summer olympics and one for winter. Why? Mostly symbolic. To say to the world, to ourselves, decisively, that we can work together, and compromise, for the benefit of humanity and the planet. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/24/191413.html?title=onlyTwoPermanentOlympicVenues#a190905" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a190921"></a>Think about it this way, we don't build a new United Nations every four years.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/24/191413.html?title=onlyTwoPermanentOlympicVenues#a190921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a190930"></a>Further, no more spectacular displays of carbon consumption. Those made sense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition">127 years ago</a>, at the dawn of electricity tech. Now it's rubbing salt in the wound. And it makes clear that we can and will sacrifice for our survival.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/24/191413.html?title=onlyTwoPermanentOlympicVenues#a190930" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a190939"></a>Specifically, no more <a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/">Christmas trees</a>. And turn down the lights in Times Square. You can't air condition the outdoors. (In NYC amazingly, there are places that do.)  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/24/191413.html?title=onlyTwoPermanentOlympicVenues#a190939" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a191027"></a>Symbolism first, change the way people think, shock people out of their sense of normalcy, then rebuild our civilization around the new low-carbon-emission ethos. You can tell your children and grandchildren that you remember a day when we built a new temporary city every two years for a two week athletic competition, and <i>never used it again.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/24/191413.html?title=onlyTwoPermanentOlympicVenues#a191027" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
