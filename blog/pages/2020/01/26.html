Put the cursor in the middle of a paragraph. Press cmd-return to split the paragraph at the cursor position, creating two headlines. Simple, I do this manually all the time, with copy-paste which is more tedious and error-prone. Also going to do the inverse, cmd-backspace to merge two headlines.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/26.html#a161746" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a191506"></a>Continue to be impressed with Brian Lehrer's Impeachment podcast. Highly recommend <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/impeachment-daily-podcast/episodes/ben-wittes">this episode</a> with Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare. I was going to ask Lehrer to do a show on what the US will be like after a Trump acquittal. This episode is a good start. Before watching another hour of CNN or MSNBC, listen to this. You'll learn a lot more. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/26.html#a191506" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I think after all the rock and roll the flyover folk would like a little peace and quiet. That's what I want. Not to have to worry about the US govt blowing the world up. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/26.html#a172335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Here's one thing that really holds back progress. When I ship a new version of a piece of software, test it. If you don't know how to do software testing, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+test+software&t=h_&ia=web">learn</a>.

	<li><a name="a141627"></a>These days, even experienced developers write ridiculous bug reports. One guy sent me an email saying he couldn't unsub from the nightly email. No clue as to what he did, or what happened. He just said it didn't work and asked if I knew what the problem was. There's nothing I can do for him.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/26/141531.html?title=testingIsNeeded#a141627" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141701"></a>20-plus years ago we had a community that tested the new stuff, and gave us good bug reports. Then we could get some work done. One of them, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+terry+teague&t=h_&ia=web">Terry Teague</a>, was a one-man QA department. He worked for Apple doing testing, but volunteered for community projects like ours, in his spare time, out of the goodness of his heart.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/26/141531.html?title=testingIsNeeded#a141701" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
