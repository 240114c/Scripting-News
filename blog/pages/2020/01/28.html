<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a215257"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen">Ben Smith</a>, current editor-in-chief at Buzzfeed News is a good choice to be the new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/media/ben-smith-buzzfeed-new-york-times.html">media columnist</a> at the NYT. He has more of a bloggers perspective imho. I like that when he got his hands on the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier">Steele dossier</a> he shared it with the world. He got in hot water with other professional news people, but why would a reporter feel compelled to keep such a hot news item private? Isn't their job to make important information public? I came to like him listening to this <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/david-remnick-and-ben-smith-discuss-how-the-media-should-cover-the-president">podcast</a> with David Remnick of the New Yorker. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/28.html#a215257" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150548"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/147">Braintrust query</a>: Is there an icon like this:  <img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/28/fileIcon.png"> in the current version of Font-Awesome? I'd like to upgrade to the latest, but without this or something very close to it, I can't. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/28.html#a150548" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/10/05/goldenGirlActionFigure.png"><a name="a141700"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/10/05/goldenGirlActionFigure.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">In a recent version of <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron">Electron</a>, they grabbed the Cmd-` keystroke to do something in the system. I was using it in an app that I depend on, use all day every day, I'm using it right now as I write this. Now Cmd-` doesn't work. The command is still in a menu, but it's way more work. Every time I have to do that work I project evil thoughts at the person who did this. I understand there's supposed to be a way around it, a way to grab the keystroke back from Electron, but I spent a half-day not getting it to work. I don't have that many half-days to throw away. Now I'm seeing the same thing happen in Chrome. Cmd-` -- they must think there are no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPAs</a> that use it, or they don't care. Now I wonder what the groundrules are. Are all my keystrokes up for grabs by the system vendor? I so vastly preferred the web when the bigco's didn't throw their weight around. When they were trying to coalesce to a standard (which they did) instead of shatter the platform into bits (which seems to be happening now). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/28.html#a141700" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
