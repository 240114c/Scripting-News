I've been trying to come to grips with how the Repubs, confronted with such clear evidence of the corruption of the president, could go along with it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/31/152146.html?title=epitaphForAmerica#a152156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153759"></a>I figured it had to be blackmail or a threat of force. We now have a Russian-style government, and this is a rite of passage.

	<li><a name="a153947"></a>In Russia, the parliament has no power. That seems to be the message bouncing around the twittersphere. Congress isn't going to do anything about this. What comes next? It's new territory for Americans, really for everyone, because the last time a great power went down this path was before the internet. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/31/152146.html?title=epitaphForAmerica#a153947" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152502"></a>I've been reading the epitaphs of the thinkers I respect most on Twitter, and there do seem to be some conclusions. <a href="https://twitter.com/Occamsreznor/status/1223223229734707201">One tweet</a> in particular makes a tremendous amount of sense, a perspective that I had not considered. The terror isn't coming from the state or oligarchs, it's coming from the net. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/31/152146.html?title=epitaphForAmerica#a152502" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a152956"></a>He got some pushback over "basically decent guy." It was deserved. We shouldn't judge people as if we're god. We don't know if he's decent. But the first part sounds right, it has to be the reason they didn't go forward with the trial. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/31/152146.html?title=epitaphForAmerica#a152956" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153212"></a>First, <a href="https://twitter.com/SenAlexander/status/1223093577145864194">Alexander</a> went out of his way to say that the Dems made their case. He doesn't want anyone to blame them, though they will certainly get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing">doxed</a> or worse. The Dems most definitely did make their case, because they were thorough and courageous, and because the president made little effort to cover his tracks. Only some of the people who work for him did. Turns out they didn't need to. Unlike with the Nixon White House, they won't be going on trial or to jail. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/31/152146.html?title=epitaphForAmerica#a153212" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153246"></a>If you were writing this as a Game of Thrones type novel, you'd be able tie up the loose-ends by saying that it was technology that did in the US. It wasn't nuclear weapons, or star wars, robots or chemical or biological weapons or even better encryption. No, it was the fact that everyone has the power to publish now, and we have these incredible machines for sharing private information, and we're just beginning to learn how to use them, and we have no idea how to contain them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/31/152146.html?title=epitaphForAmerica#a153246" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-type="outline"><a name="a152655"></a>This is one of those days I've written four posts without publishing. They'll all go out at once, in various states of completion. But it's a day of ideas. I am depressed, in the same way I was the day after the 2016 election. But I had a good night's sleep, and the coffee is good. It's cold outside, but warm inside. I have all my material needs taken care of, and I have a powerful publishing platform, and the best tools, so I'm on-balance doing ok I guess. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/31/171104.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes#a152655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline"><a name="a152535"></a>Old habits die hard. I'm using an outliner that has cmd-return implemented. Yet I just split a paragraph using the old select-copy-return-paste ritual. I didn't even have to think about it. It's programmed into my subconscious at the base of my spine. It takes no conscious effort to do the keys. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/31/171104.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes#a152535" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
