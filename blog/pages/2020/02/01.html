<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155218"></a>I'm reviewing docs and little issues re the <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a> release. Looking for an example of a status center, I found <a href="http://scripting.com/status/">Dave's Dev Status</a>. Forgot I had set this up. <a href="http://lo.1999.io/2017/02/02/statusCenters.html">You can create</a> one with LO2. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01.html#a155218" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a204205"></a>I am gradually switching off Dropbox, and wrote a piece of software called <a href="http://publicfolder.io/">Public Folder</a> to sync with Amazon S3. Despite its name it works for private stuff too. I use it for all my this.how docs and a few other projects. Works great. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01.html#a204205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="tweet" data-tweetId="1223637438163292162" data-tweetUserName="davewiner"><a name="a155902"></a>When I read an article about online "bernie bros" -- I wonder if the author remembers not to trust the intent of people who tweet at them. We learned this in 2016. Trolls try to divide us, they enflame both sides. I would never trust a "bernie bro" to be an actual person. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01.html#a155902" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a201807"></a>I was wondering how the courts will incorporate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump">Senate's decision</a> into their interpretation of the Constitution. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a201807" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a203040"></a>Will they judge the executive as if the president is a monarch now?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a203040" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a201824"></a>They can't overrule the Senate, that seems clear from the Constitution.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a201824" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a201824"></a>Another question. What will the Repubs in the Senate do if/when Trump pushes the boundaries. For example, suppose he has a journalist killed. Lots of witnesses. He admits it. Assuming the House impeaches him, what does the Senate do? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a201824" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a201915"></a>A less radical hypothetical. What if he arrests Hillary Clinton for interfering with his re-election. Seems likely that will go to court. Say the Supreme Court rules this is illegal or unconstitutional. Will Trump respect that even though the Senate appears to have said it's OK.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a201915" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a202538"></a>I imagine the scholars and judges are thinking about this now. This has been a precedent-setting trial. If they actually do acquit him when no one contests the truth, it appears the only part of the government that objects is the House. It seems the question will be raised in the courts as well. It'll appear on Roberts' desk before too long. Is the president really a king?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a202538" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
