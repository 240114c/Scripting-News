I'm angry and frustrated that the NFL won't hire former Niners quarterback <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a>. I also remember the intellect, wisdom, character, professionalism, talent and luck of the Niners of the 80s and 90s. So just for tonight, I'll be a football fan again. Go Niners! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üèà</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/02.html#a223229" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a192032"></a>BTW, to tech-savvy users who are regulars here. Please pitch in and help test the new <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01.html#a174348">release</a> of <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a>. As you can see from the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150">thread</a> on GitHub, the problems tend to be technical, though the typical user of the <a href="http://cribsheet.opml.org/">outliner</a> is not. If you've looked for a way to pitch in, this is where I need the most help. Keep an outline on <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a>. When there's a new release try editing it. Do the changes stick when you reload the page? Try creating a new outline. Open an existing one. Log off and log on. Go through the menus and try all the commands. We're looking for breakage, something that used to work but because of changes doesn't work now. A lot of stuff changed in this release. But most of it isn't visible to users. Help me out. This is foundational work. I need LO2 to work for people, smoothly. Thanks.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/02.html#a192032" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Heh. And then I read that Bloomberg's spokesperson, Julie Wood (a woman, this is important) said this: "The president is lying. He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity, and his spray-on tan."  You know, this is the first time in four years Trump has been in presidential politics, talking about people's bodies and demeanor, that someone has come back at him with this line of attack, which is totally valid. When you're being bullied by someone so obviously vulnerable, give it back to him. It's even <s>worse</s> better when a woman says a man is a liar, bald, fat, and wears makeup. Trust me on that. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üí•</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/02.html#a184357" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Spoilers follow. I think they planned the second-to-last episode as the actual final episode. Had they done that I would have said who ever thought a comedy like Bojack Horseman would try something so ambitious, and even better, pull it off. But they added one more plot twist, it's really hard to parse, and the rest of the final episode is weird and repetitive, and at the end punts the ending. Still a groundbreaking show that's often LOL funny. I <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/whyYouMustWatchBojackHorseman.html">wish</a> all my friends would watch it so we can talk about it. Now I'll take some time and read the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6">reviews</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/02/190035.html?title=bojackFinaleInitialThoughts#a185629" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
