<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/05/carville.png"><a name="a150458"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/05/carville.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1224834573688766466">James Carville</a> on MSNBC last night. He speaks for me. The goal of this election is to get power. To do that we need to run a smart campaign as in 2018. He says the party needs a new chairman, who should it be -- he says Ask Nancy Pelosi. Beat the drum with talking points that rarely stray off health care, climate, education. Over and over.  Take power and get the Repubs out of the way and then do what needs to be done. Pick a presidential candidate that fits this plan. Nothing more complex. We're not electing god, we're electing someone who can lead us out of the nightmare of a morass we are now in. Wake the fuck up people who think the election is about the candidates. It is not. Once we have a plan, the candidate will follow the plan. That's all. Think like someone in a smoke filled room. We wanted that power, now learn to use it. That's what Carville said last night. Really passionate and smart. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/05.html#a150458" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150958"></a>The only criteria for a candidate: I want someone who, when a Republican who believes in the rule of law sees them, they think -- I could vote for them. Even better, I <i>want</i> to vote for them. In this election there are two sides, one side believes in the rule of law, the other doesn't. It isn't about any issue other than that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/05.html#a150958" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165956"></a>Yesterday I signed up for the Bloomberg campaign. I take him at his word, if he isn't the nominee, he will back the actual candidate with his money and organization. I hope he starts a political social network, the one I thought Obama was <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html">building</a>, not to make money (eg FB, Twitter), rather to allow us to organize politically without interference from trolls. Someone has to do this, I hope Bloomberg will.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/05.html#a165956" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a182841"></a>I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1225111846207684608">tweet</a> by Joe Biden just now where he asks if the government he was part of was a failure. When you ask the question like that, the answer is somewhat startling. Yes. The Obama government was a failure. In the same way the French government of 1940 was a failure. Sure, they passed some good laws, and the people of France were happy, but when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France">Germans marched into Paris</a> in 1940, you would have to say that the existing government of France failed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/05/182834.html?title=weLostTheWar#a182841" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a183017"></a>We were attacked in 2016, and we lost. How do I know we lost? We're not mounting a defense. We didn't counter-attack. If we had, and we had won, Putin would be gone, and Russia would be establishing an American style government. Instead, Putin is fine, and we're installing, gradually, a Russian-style government. That's the only explanation for what's happening in the Senate this afternoon at 4PM Eastern.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/05/182834.html?title=weLostTheWar#a183017" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a183157"></a>Biden, if he has any honor, will withdraw from the race. We lost. He was VP when we lost. We cannot under any circumstances go back to that approach. That would be certainly a loser. If there's any hope for us, we need a very radical departure from the previous path, and I do not mean Bernie Sanders. People who think that are as much in denial as Joe Biden was before he asked the question. Now that he has, if he has guts like he says he does, it's time to step aside. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/05/182834.html?title=weLostTheWar#a183157" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a184134"></a>PS: Is there a reason Nancy Pelosi can't be the next president? If there is I don't know what it is. In fact, she is our leader. And a very good one at that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/05/182834.html?title=weLostTheWar#a184134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
