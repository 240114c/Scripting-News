Your donations are divided between them. I just gave $100. It's a good idea, good for the country.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/06.html#a154511" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

When the Senate votes on something consequential, such as whether to remove the president, let's have a readout that shows the number of people the Yes votes represent, by state, and the number of people the No votes represent. It would measure how far our government is from being a democracy. I would love to see this as a website.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/06.html#a155954" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a231546"></a>Randall Neff did an <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/06/Senate-vote-2020-02-05.xlsx">Excel spreadsheet</a> for the impeachment trial. It wasn't as lopsided as I imagined. Roughly 52% to convict, 48% to acquit. The reps of a majority of Americans thought he was guilty, but not nearly enough to convict him. Here's the spreadsheet <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/06/Senate-vote-2020-02-05.pdf">in PDF</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/06.html#a231546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155057"></a>Why is Trump's approval rating going up? This question came up on Brian Lehrer's fantastic <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">WNYC radio show</a> this morning. Here's my theory. During the trial, Trump wasn't controlling the public conversation. So we didn't always hear about Trump's latest outrage every minute of every day. If he were to tone it down permanently, only spoke when a president would normally speak, he might be more popular.    <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/06.html#a155057" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I would definitely vote and work for her, without reservations.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/06.html#a155750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a233347"></a>It's been a while since we had an Occam's News report. Here's the latest. In the impeachment trial, if the jury could have been sure there would be no retribution for a vote of guilty, a lot more would have voted that way. A bunch of them would have voted to acquit even if there would be no retribution, because they think the US is going to privatize massive parts of the government, and they want to be in position to get some of that. Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/06.html#a233347" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
