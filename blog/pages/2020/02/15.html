<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE"><a name="a195211"></a>When <a href="https://youtu.be/aFQFB5YpDZE">Jon Stewart</a> went on CNN to plead that they give a shit. It's hard to watch because it was 2004, and it's gotten so much worse since then. Makes you realize that we wouldn't be in this mess if we had journalism instead of this garbage. Also fascinating that everyone thought he was joking, but everything he said was serious. The "news" was and is an emotional release.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/15.html#a195211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But it's only half the job. The other half is organizing the electorate so we are always mobilized and ready for action.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/15.html#a154731" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142106"></a>Questions for all Democratic candidates, esp <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/14/141155.html?title=presidentBloombergReallyADemocrat">Bloomberg</a>. Do you feel the president is above the law? If you are elected, will you use the new powers Trump has taken for himself? What will you do if Trump refuses to leave?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/15.html#a142106" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141926"></a>I don’t miss Obama. When I see Obama I think of how we lost the war and he didn’t put up a fight. I think of how he let McConnell terrorize us without trying to organize us. I think history will judge him a failure. PS: This is btw why Biden has no chance.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/15.html#a141926" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Telling a nasty asshole bully troll what you really think of them might be satisfying, for a moment, but you end up with all the nasty shit in your heart and it doesn't go away. It's hard to hold back, but you must.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/15.html#a140712" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
