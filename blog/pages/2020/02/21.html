Why not hold House hearings on what every American should watch for and be on guard against in terms of how Russia or any other foreign actor tries to influence our election?   Or maybe a network do a one hour special?  No one knows what meddling means."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/21.html#a191449" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Look at how Bloomberg is being invalidated. He's a powerful force in Democratic politics. In whose interest is it to undermine that? They have to be investing in that. The meddlers, whoever they are.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/21.html#a194007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a135342"></a>Bloomberg was NYC mayor after 9/11, during and after the 2008 financial crisis and Hurricane Sandy. The city recovered from all, though we could discuss his mistakes during all.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/21/135325.html?title=bloombergPart3#a135342" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
