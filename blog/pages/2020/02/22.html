Soon it will be an issue for everyone who lives in the US. You will have to sign a loyalty oath. We're way past the time when anyone should be working just for themselves.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/22.html#a175307" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a173504"></a>Today I learned that <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/20/144006.html?title=notesOnLastNightsDebate#a144753">Sanders</a> will be the presumptive Democratic Party nominee in eleven days, unless something happens to shake that up.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a181146"></a>I just saw pictures of a friend's teenage sons in current passport pictures. I've been following their travels via Facebook for years. They were always boys, but now you can see the men. There's a gravitas in the outward view. Thought. These boys were raised to be men. What a great word, <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/raised">raised</a>. I don't think I was actually raised myself. Maybe here and there. Fed. Sometimes cared for. Mostly left to figure it out for myself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/22.html#a181146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was surprised. I think this may be the first time I've heard him give a speech. Previously I'd only seen him in debates, where he's a prick. Sorry, that's what I see. Even so, he really never has had a negative campaign run against him, and it'll be too late for all of us when the Repubs do. I can't imagine his past is not filled with lots of really awful stuff. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/22.html#a034204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a033558"></a>Doc said he doesn't really understand how Twitter threading works.
