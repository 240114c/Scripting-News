Clearly something is very wrong. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/24.html#a010723" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

First, <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/01/theWorldIsSocialist.html">The world is socialist</a> in 2011. "Ayn Rand's philosophy might have worked in an agrarian society when people lived far apart, and couldn't pool their resources. When there wasn't much technology, so there wasn't much point in trying to fight disease or keep the trains running, because there was no medicine or trains." And <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/03/08/theWorldIsSocialistPartIi.html">Health care is socialist</a> in 2017. "We don't know who will get sick, or when. So rather than take a risk that you'll be the one who gets the expensive disease, we pool our resources to pay a share of what the treatment would cost each year." I put "issue" in quotes because it isn't a real issue. Everything is socialist, it has to be, there is no other way. So it's redundant to say someone is a socialist. We all are. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/24.html#a201753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It works pretty well. There are things that could work better, but I like it. It's a good car for where I live, in the mountains north of NYC. But it's not perfect. About the half the time the driver seatbelt gets stuck in the door. It was a hassle until now, but all the buckle slamming has broken a sensor built into the door. The car's electronics thinks the door is always open even when it's closed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/24/150127.html?title=theSeatbeltOnMySubaru#a150135" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150730"></a>Now the battery runs down overnight and the car requires a jump start. And all the alarms are ringing when I'm driving. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/24/150127.html?title=theSeatbeltOnMySubaru#a150730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150420"></a>I took the car in for service. It's still under warranty, but Subaru wants me to pay for the repair. Estimate $500. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/24/150127.html?title=theSeatbeltOnMySubaru#a150420" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a150530"></a>Seems to me it's a design flaw. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/24/150127.html?title=theSeatbeltOnMySubaru#a150530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
