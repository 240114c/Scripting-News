I have to admit, I didn't think of it at the time either, to me the function of a news org was to start fresh once a day. But this was always part of the potential of the web, create a base of info at the same time as flowing the new stuff. That's actually where we went with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+lbbs">LBBS</a> in the 80s. Did you know I was doing BBS software then? I was. Today I wish we had software that made it easy to build an index as we go. It's always in the back of my mind. I remember when we were publishing books (also in the 80s) we learned how to do indexes of paper books. The same approach would work for blogs or news.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/25.html#a160246" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154409"></a>Maybe when Coronavirus comes to our town we should all just get it, and take our chances. Get it over with quickly.

Now there's a chance to do just that. Use your advertising, rallies, interviews and debates to sound the alarm for <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus">coronavirus</a>. Demand that Trump protect the citizens.  Explain what Trump has done to put us at greater risk.  Explain how a real government functions for the benefit of its citizens.
