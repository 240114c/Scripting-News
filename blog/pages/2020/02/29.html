"HTTPS is great, but it isn’t for everything. It shouldn’t be for personal sites." There's a bigger picture. Google shouldn't try to take control of HTTP. As I say in my <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">FAQ</a>, Google is a guest on the web, as we all are. Guests don't make the rules. There are good reasons to keep HTTP simple. None of us have the right to change it. It is what it is. Scripting News will never be forced to do anything by Google, I don't recognize their authority to force anyone to do anything on the web. If HTTPS is such a great idea, there would be no reason to force anyone to do it, we'd do it because we want to. <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">More here</a>.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/29.html#a200706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
