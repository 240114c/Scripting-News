In the middle of season 2, I more or less understand who the characters are and the plot. I don't know why it took so many tries to get it. <span class="spSpoiler">I am sure that Julie Mao and Miller are melding into some kind of incredible love monster whose body is the planet of Venus. I also think their meeting was the sexiest thing I've seen on TV ever</span>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/03.html#a164943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Spoilers are now hidden behind a placeholder. This is how it works. Warning there's a spoiler in this video about how spoilers work. Not kidding. If you haven't seen The Expanse and think you might, you should avert your eyes at the right moment in this video. <i>Sorry! </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/03.html#a173306" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a030828"></a>Democrats have one goal. Trump out in a landslide. All the insiders talk about turnout, but you know what, that's up to us, the voters. I think that's the message of tonight. If he wins, Biden has been drafted to be our representative. We should organize <i>ourselves</i> so we can't be ignored after the election. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/03.html#a030828" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The economy will shrink, no way to avoid that.
