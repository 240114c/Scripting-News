<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a021810"></a>Has it occurred to you that the measures we're taking to fight the virus are also some of what we need to do to fight the climate crisis?

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154020"></a>I'm still hoping for help testing the new version of LO2. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/156">list of things you should try</a>. By testing, you're helping me think about bigger changes to the software in the future. If we don't test new versions, as a community, I can't take risks of breaking stuff. That's how it works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html#a154020" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm soooo glad they can't tell when they've been snoozed. Oops I'm probably making all my friends think it's them. Trust me, it's not you. We're cool.
