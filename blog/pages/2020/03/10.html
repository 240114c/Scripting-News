<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a173244"></a>We should make a <a href="http://this.how/virus/whatShouldBeClosed.opml">list of activities</a> that should come to a stop now. For example, movie theaters are done. In-person sports events. Offices, schools, mass transit.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174921"></a>Think about it this way. What if you got a 2-week advance notice that something really shitty was about to happen, and you actually know a lot about what will happen. I listened to a podcast with an expert on this stuff, and he said we got lucky this time. Imagine that. We got lucky, weird, but yes we did.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/10.html#a174921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

"People can leave their homes to get to and from work, a health appointment, family necessity such as food shop. Otherwise stay inside. If kids are going stir crazy they can be taken for walk. But no gatherings of people."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/10.html#a142021" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The economy is going to stop like the economy in New Orleans did after Katrina. One of the big lessons of Katrina was that once stopped, it takes a long time for an economy to reboot.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/10/144015.html?title=morningTweets#a143944" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

They're mobilized in Wash because they have the biggest outbreak in the US so far. And we are soft in the west, we can't imagine things being not-normal.   People in New Orleans however I'm sure are aware of the hazard.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/10/144015.html?title=morningTweets#a143943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
