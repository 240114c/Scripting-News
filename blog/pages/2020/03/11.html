The audiobook is the way to go because he plays his guitar while he's narrating. Many of his famous songs are all autobiographical. And his story is surprising. I didn't know anything about him. (Hold on. It's an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/02/09/803843220/james-taylor-narrates-life-before-fame-and-sings-american-standards-on-new-album">audio memoir</a>. There is no written version.

No surprise -- of course it <i>is</i> because of our attitude toward gender, and the way it forms women's public personalities. I don't know how it gets better, but first imho you have to understand the problem. Here's the story from my point of view.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/161109.html?title=whyHillaryClintonIsntPresident#a162239" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a161142"></a>I supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, so I noticed things from a woman's point of view that I normally wouldn't. In debates, Bernie Sanders yelled over her or waved his hands in her face. She couldn't respond in kind. I wanted the moderators to put a stop to it. She couldn't respond in kind because who would tolerate a woman who behaved like that. Exactly why we shouldn't tolerate a man behaving like that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/161109.html?title=whyHillaryClintonIsntPresident#a161142" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a161350"></a>When I hear people say they hate Hillary Clinton, I remember when I hated her too. I remember exactly the moment that changed. Listening to an incredibly smart and well-spoken women being interviewed on NPR and stopping the car and waiting to find out who it was. Hillary Clinton. This was in the 90s when she was First Lady. Ever since I've challenged my assumptions on why I hate a public figure. I think about it, and decide whether that's correct. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/161109.html?title=whyHillaryClintonIsntPresident#a161350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a161536"></a>The source of the hate was resentment. Who was she to have such a public voice. The bug was that of course she had earned a public voice. As wife of the president, she wasn't as she said the kind of woman who stays home and bakes cookies. She was very much part of the presidency. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/161109.html?title=whyHillaryClintonIsntPresident#a161536" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a161718"></a>So, Hillary Clinton eventually became a Senator then a Secretary and then a candidate for president. Of course I supported her. Over the years I had come to appreciate her intelligence, hard work, thoughtfulness, all the qualities you want in a president. But one. She often lacked confidence. She was incredible of course, I could not do what she did, that's not the point. You can feel confidence in another person, and hers was fragile, a surface-level thing, it's where the sense she wasn't "authentic" came from. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/161109.html?title=whyHillaryClintonIsntPresident#a161718" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a161911"></a>When she was finally coasting to victory, the wind at her back, you could feel it, she could feel it, all of a sudden it comes crashing down, with another <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/">bogus attack</a>, the kind she had been suffering her whole life, the process that knocked her confidence down so thoroughly. She collapsed. You could see it in every speech, every interview. She was doing a great job of trying to hide it, but it couldn't be hidden. She was defeated. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/161109.html?title=whyHillaryClintonIsntPresident#a161911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162026"></a>HRC had been going through this all her life. It scarred her. She tried to do something that in her time proved to be impossible. There's no shame in that, but that is imho why she isn't president. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/161109.html?title=whyHillaryClintonIsntPresident#a162026" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

And I'm sure you can go on from there. It isn't very long until everyone on the planet has had the disease. No one is immune.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/142306.html?title=ourPrecariousPosition#a142624" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

But at some point, say the 15th week, we will have completely used up all the hospital beds, and then the death rate will go way up.

	<li><a name="a142848"></a>We're venturing into the unknown. Life is always like that, but at most times we can hide it from ourselves, we go on with our usual routine. Most days are pretty ordinary.

I knew the city well because I had gone to college there. What I saw was a city that would never recover from what happened. It would continue, that was obvious, but it would never again be the city I knew. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/142306.html?title=ourPrecariousPosition#a142948" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143154"></a>There are smart things we can do, and unfortunately in the United States, we aren't doing them. Of course. We're too stupid to think these things through. Our government sees this as an opportunity to shovel more money to themselves and their cronies. No thought is put into easing the strain on the health care system. On making it easy for every sick person to get the care they need, hospitalization, or the ability to stay home when sick so they don't infect others. To increase the survival rate, and slow the spread. We still haven't gotten the message that we all lose when people among us who are sick go untreated, especially when with a viral infectious disease for which no one is immune. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/142306.html?title=ourPrecariousPosition#a143154" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143423"></a>The smart thing to do right now would be to quickly replace our government with one that is immersed in the math and logic of virality. To get Sanders off the campaign trail and in Washington to plead the case for single payer health care now, for everyone. He, unlike most Congress people, has the attention of the press. We need to close down every opportunity for the virus to infect masses of people, and treat and isolate those who do get infected. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/142306.html?title=ourPrecariousPosition#a143423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
