<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/12/purell.png"><a name="a174728"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/12/purell.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I had to drive to the car dealer today to pick up my car. Along the way, I had many opportunities to pick up the virus. First was when I crossed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston%E2%80%93Rhinecliff_Bridge">Rhinecliff Bridge</a> and had to stop to pay a toll. The toll booth operator had gloves on. I gave her six quarters and before continuing, I wiped the hand that touched hers. Her glove was accumulating all the viruses on everyone's hands who paid the toll. At the dealer, I had to sign a form to get my car back. They gave me a pen to use. I had no idea who else had used the pen. They did have hand sanitizer on the desk. I used it. Also thought about stealing it, but didn't. When I got my car, I rubbed down the steering wheel with sanitizer. Forgot to wipe the gear shift or the controls for the heating system, until after I touched them. On the way back I got a car wash. Paid the attendant $12 in cash, and he gave me change, again in cash. I thought about all the people who had touched the bills, including the attendant. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/12.html#a174728" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a190744"></a>People who think they're humane, even liberal or progressive, think they have big hearts, treat people like statistics.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180017"></a>An easy feel-good thing for Trump to announce last night. The government is giving <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=purell+hand+sanitizer&safe=off&sxsrf=ALeKk00X5m8RpdZl18JT0weV2x5HHPz1nw:1584036262618&source=univ&tbm=shop&tbo=u&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtlvr1wpXoAhUHmHIEHb-YCJQQsxh6BAgRECw">Purell</a> $1 billion to make as much hand sanitizer as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-makes-purell-hand-sanitizer-gojo-industries-coronavirus-2020-3">they</a> can.

This could be it. But if it isn't, I have some great software in mind. Funny how being this scared brings out the creativity. On the other hand if this is the time to go -- I'd rather have it be in a plot of a terrible science fiction novel than say going in my sleep. The drama of Trump's speech last night. At one point I thought he was losing it and was going to start talking like Jerry Lewis in the <a href="https://youtu.be/neEe1itDC_k?t=320">Nutty Professor</a>. I think that would have been good for everyone, but he got himself back on track. His eyes are dead. No one home. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/12.html#a143012" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
