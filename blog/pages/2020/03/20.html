They were sharp, irreverent, and the first effective pushback on Trump since he took office. Now the money goes to the DNC, to disappear into a void of nothingness.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/20.html#a151105" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

She made it to Seoul. I had a voice chat with her just after midnight Eastern. I wanted to discuss a possible twist to her travels. In Seoul, she has a good network through the University of Utah. Of course it's one of the few places where the virus is being fought effectively, the US is a somewhere between a shitshow and a clusterfuck. I wanted to suggested she skip the return to the US and just stay there for the duration. Of course she was thinking about that. She had decided to let fate determine the outcome. If her flight to Seattle wasn't canceled she would return. If not, she'd stay in Seoul, and not try to return through some other hub like Dubai. It's pretty clear now that there aren't going to be many, if any, more flights to the US from South Korea, or anywhere for that matter. At about 5AM, I got a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/20/jenplane.png">text</a> saying she was on the plane. A few minutes later it <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL198">took off</a>. I'm happy, I'd like to see her again, and I'm not sure that could happen if she had stayed there. Also, I'm not sure if Jen is better off here, but we are. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/20.html#a141448" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144354"></a>I saw a video of Trump listening to Pence speak on a conference call. People said he looked bored, but that's not what I saw. I saw he resented having to listen to Pence. What was Pence talking about? Saving our lives. Yeah. That's not important.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/20.html#a144354" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
