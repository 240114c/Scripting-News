To see what an American city was like after it was half-destroyed. What I learned would inform the people making financial decisions in DC. They're not understanding what's going to be left when this is done. Saving corporations is not a possibility. We should be focused on surviving as people and a country. In Katrina people had somewhere to evacuate to. This time we don't. On the other hand nothing we made need be destroyed. It should mostly be here when we emerge. I suppose pirates could hijack airplanes, or occupy skyscrapers in Manhattan. A question I learned to ask from New Orleans. Who's going to supply the supply chain? They had trouble rebuilding because there was no place for the builders to sleep, and no food for them to eat, and no one to prepare it because they had nowhere to live. We need really smart people there thinking and planning. Yet this is the fog of war. We have very little data on the enemy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/22.html#a185353" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true"><a name="a210841"></a>Michael Backes studies and writes about cannabis. Here's his best advice about using it "during the 2020 Covid-19 World Tour." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/22/210731.html?title=usingCannabisDuringCovid19#a210841" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulNumberedSubs">
	<li><a name="a210910"></a>Moderation - Cannabis interacts with your body's endocannabinoid system, which the body uses to regulate physiological function- from immune response to memory. Regular high-dose use reduces the density of your endocannabinoid receptors. That's a really poor choice at the moment. Three days of abstinence can restore a significant part of that lost receptor density. Good time to consider a short break. Trust me, cannabis will be there when you get back.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/22/210731.html?title=usingCannabisDuringCovid19#a210910" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a210914"></a>Find your MED - MED stands for minimum effective dose. There are still folks that think that huge doses of cannabis are a demonstration of their expertise. Sorry, Cheech. The cool folks know that massive doses quickly lead to the disappearance of the subtlest and most interesting effects of cannabis. Find the smallest MED that moves your needle and stick with it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/22/210731.html?title=usingCannabisDuringCovid19#a210914" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a210917"></a>Freeze your stash - Cannabis is more than its THC or CBD content. Cannabis flower is perishable and room temperatures degrade its essential oil content. Freeze and just take what you're going to consume. Make sure the freezer container is airtight (I recommend mason jars, as they come in many sizes and are non-reactive with cannabis.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/22/210731.html?title=usingCannabisDuringCovid19#a210917" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a210925"></a>Inhale with care - Cannabis smoke and cannabis concentrates can irritate your lungs and suppress your pulmonary immune function and response. Consider mixing it up by taking cannabis orally or switching to a flower vaporizer. An occasional puff is okay, but only if your lungs are in good shape and you're symptom free. Don't inhale if you have symptoms or have been exposed. Period.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/22/210731.html?title=usingCannabisDuringCovid19#a210925" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
