<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160130"></a>I watched the finale of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)#Season_3">season 3 </a>of The Expanse without realizing it was the last <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_3_(2018)">episode</a> before Amazon took it over. It was masterful. I'm going to have to watch it again. BTW, my favorite character is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8t4czs/drummerwhat_a_character/">Drummer</a>. I am a Belter, for sure. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/23.html#a160130" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm guessing that in the US we can't use that data even though companies like Google, Apple and Facebook have it. The context has changed, and now trillions of dollars are at stake, the existence of our economy, our lives (hope that's not too dramatic). Perhaps it's time to re-think our assumptions. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/23.html#a154211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a205517"></a>I have a rule. No online debates. Here's a reason why. Even with friends there could be a basic disconnect early in the discussion. If it's done in voice, you can hear that. In text you might not hear it until you've gone back four or five times.
