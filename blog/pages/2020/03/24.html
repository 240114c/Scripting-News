My next project is to figure out how to flow this through an RSS feed so it can be a podcast. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbrianbluestein/">Richard Bluestein</a> did the MP3.

If Trump wants to ride with them, well I'd be impressed, and would also ask Mike Pence to be ready to assume the presidency. Trump may have forgotten that at age 73, he's in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/24/viral-on-air-plea-captures-an-essential-truth-about-trump/">expendable class</a> according to his Republican (supposed) friends.

He's a <a href="http://this.how/trolls/">troll</a>, now and forever, even with our lives.

It’s our attitude, there are never consequences for Americans. That’s for other people. We have wars and tax cuts at the same time. We don’t see the coffins of our returning dead. Nothing happens to us. We can’t imagine things not being normal. The generation that grew up during World War II, who experienced the Holocaust, the advent of nuclear weapons, that generation is gone now. Everyone alive today, not just boomers, have been spoiled. We're all coming awake now from a life-long trance. For the first time in our lives, we have to deal with the mortality of our country. Don't cry for America. It's time to grow up, again. Couldn't have a more perfect person as president. It's easy to see he is our past. Now how do we move beyond that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/24.html#a193758" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a163015"></a>Went to a local supermarket this morning. It was empty of people. The shelves were pretty well stocked. I went because a friend told me there were paper products. I got four rolls of paper towels. And two packages of bacon (why not, who knows when we'll see it again). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/24.html#a163015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Think clearly about the user experience. Some sites have popups and cluttered templates, even paywalls. If technical people want to do something to help, i.e. the people who read this blog, try to simplify and ease access to your sites. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/24.html#a161922" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
