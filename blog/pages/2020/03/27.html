The economics of Coronavirus. They breezed by a huge issue. Millions of Americans without health insurance, no savings, no job, sick, homeless, hungry, plus guns. The <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/21.html#a011845">ticking time bomb</a> I wrote about briefly on March 21. The so-called stimulus Congress passed, what a joke, does nothing to address this. I would much preferred see the $2 trillion give everyone the health care they need, keep us all fed, and reboot the economy around serving the people of the country. The UK did this, by guaranteeing 80% of people's salaries for the duration. They already have a national health care system. We are headed for a big crash. Congress didn't deal with it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/27.html#a213848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140046"></a>I don't feel good about this. I was glad to hear Boris Johnson got the CV, not because I hold anything against him, but if he can get it so can Trump. And I think that would be good for Americans who are scared out of our minds about this disease esp because our president is not.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/27.html#a140046" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
