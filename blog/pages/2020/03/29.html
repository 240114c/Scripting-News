In the end I went another way, adding a long-wanted plug-in capability to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark">PagePark</a>, my labor-of-love Node-based web server. I found a really Nodey way to do it, much better imho than using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp">eval</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_vm.asp">vm</a>. I <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_modules.asp">use</a> <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html">modules</a>. A lot of people don't know they can be in files, not just distributed through NPM. It's a really nice way to do plug-ins, and it's made something cool possible with Little Outliner. More on that later. In the meantime I've written up the use of modules as PagePark plug-ins in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/158#issuecomment-605650163">thread</a> about regex.<i> Still diggin!</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/29.html#a150309" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Summary. There won't be enough testing, probably for the rest of the year. Same with ventilators and gear to protect the medical people. What's missing is national leadership, to tell people the truth, let us know what we're needed to do. We can accept that. What is killing us is the constant chaos.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/29.html#a142319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Take United Airlines for example. They would have gone bankrupt, their assets sold to pay creditors. There would still be a United Airlines. The planes would still fly. The shareholders would have lost everything. Owning stock is risky, or it should be -- especially when you don't save for a rainy day as United didn't. Same old shit. Upside is private. Downside is socialist. We need real health care, people need food, a place to live, a job. We had the opportunity now to ensure all that. Weâ€™re trying to prop up an old obsolete system. People are left to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21197279/coronavirus-us-unemployment-health-insurance">fend</a> for themselves, but stockholders are made whole.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/29.html#a141602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
