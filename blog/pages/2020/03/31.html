"I was already cautiously optimistic that the virus is milder than we realize, because of the testing bias towards very ill patients. Now there's evidence that may be true, from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-28/dutch-hospital-workers-show-insidious-nature-of-coronavirus">Dutch study</a> that would not only explain why it spreads so well, but is an argument for why 100% of the population should wear masks in public, and why we should exhaustively test healthy people as well. The more people who have already been infected with sub-clinical or no symptoms, the lower and sooner the peak will be, at least here in NYC where it's already likely to sweep the population."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/31.html#a170202" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He's setting the example for the rest of the country.

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a153001"></a>Usually I get groceries once a week, and there's nothing surprising about it, certainly nothing that's blogworthy. Today it's different. It was time to go, and I dreaded it. But I had a mask, and they have sanitizing wipes at the front door, and I had read all about how to do it safely, so I went. A few notes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/31/152954.html?title=myTripToTheSupermarket#a153001" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a153109"></a>The store wasn't empty, but it wasn't very full either. People were cheerful, as they often are in the country. I didn't think I'd be able to smile through <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/30/153915.html?title=myNewMask#a143558">the mask</a>, but I figured it out. I say hello and tell the other person that I'm wearing a mask (obviously) and smiling under it. Which of course makes my eyes smile. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/31/152954.html?title=myTripToTheSupermarket#a153109" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153220"></a>I got almost everything I wanted, and more. It's still an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World">American</a> supermarket. Filled to the brim with goodies and the essentials. I got meat, milk, eggs, veggies, bags of onions, potatoes and oranges. A 24-pack of water and my two favorite kinds of diet soda. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/31/152954.html?title=myTripToTheSupermarket#a153220" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a153327"></a>And to my surprise they had wipes! I got the last two packages. And they have a limit of <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/31/announcement.png">two per customer</a>. See the photo <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/31/152954.html?title=myTripToTheSupermarket#a155305">below</a>. This made the whole trip worthwhile. I desperately have wanted to have some of the basic sanitizing supplies at home. Now I do. And I love that they have the daily limit of two per customer. I heard about people hoarding, coming back to the store three times a day to swipe up all the paper goods and cleaners. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/31/152954.html?title=myTripToTheSupermarket#a153327" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155638"></a>The checkout station was revamped. There's a red line that keeps you from getting to close to the checkout person. There's a plastic shield separating the customer and the clerk. They don't pack your cloth bags, but they're happy to use their paper bags, which they're now giving out for free after a few months of getting us to switch over. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/31/152954.html?title=myTripToTheSupermarket#a155638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
