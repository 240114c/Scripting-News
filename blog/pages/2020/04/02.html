In the last ten minutes they finally get to the important stuff, i.e. what's coming. Now I understand the next phase of the virus much better. I'm also glad to hear they're considering the functioning of society in their plans. At some point we're going to have to provide health care to the people who can't afford it, if we ever want to come out of this. Imho the sooner the better, but Fauci has to take as a given that the president is who he is. I've never said anything was more of a must-listen than this podcast. I think they should play the last ten minutes on Maddow tonight. Everyone with a mind needs to hear this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02.html#a193712" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a181346"></a>My poor uncle, my father's brother, was <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/01/29/myUncleSam.html">murdered</a>. I think how sad that the last person he saw was someone who had just killed him. I feel the same way about watching The Trump Show on MSNBC every evening at 6PM. He's murdering us. Why  would we want to listen to him?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02.html#a181346" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

"Hong Kong and Italy got exposed to the same virus. The pandemic is not caused by a virus, it's caused by the failure of effective governance. In other words, the huge and preventable numbers of people dying currently...are dying from the effects of dysfunctional governance."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02.html#a171838" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I am once again unfollowing people who RT Trump, and I am now also unfollowing people who RT Kellyanne Conway. They make us stupid. Waste our capacity to think. Reduce everything to emotion. Trump and Conway are intellectual pneumonia. They fill your mind with emotional nonsense, crowding out your ability to think. The cure is simple. Distance yourself from them, and people who are infected with them. Even people you like.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02.html#a173423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152044"></a>I may have finally run out of things to write about! See <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02.html#a151646">below</a>. I actually write about <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=disinfecting+wipes&t=h_&ia=shopping">disinfecting wipes</a>. If you had told me, in say 1998, that by 2020 I'd be writing about wipes, I would have assumed something terrible had happened, not to the world, but to me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02.html#a152044" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Can you use them in place of washing hands? When would you do that?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02.html#a151646" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<div class="divTitle"><a name="a162221"></a><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark"><span class="spTitleLink">JavaScript plug-ins for PagePark</a></a><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
	<ul class="ulLevel0">
	<li><a name="a162227"></a>This is a technical description of a new server bridge between two apps, <a href="http://pagepark.io/">PagePark</a> and <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner</a>. It's now possible to view user-editable files through PagePark as long as they've been made public. This is how the pieces fit together. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a162227" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1">
	<li><a name="a162309"></a><a href="http://pagepark.io/">PagePark</a> is a Node-based HTTP server that has special understanding of two kinds of files -- <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">OPML</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a162309" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel2">
	<li><a name="a162352"></a>For Markdown files, it renders them in a template. So you don't have to repeat the envelope for each bit of text, and it's easy to modify, for all pages. So it's a bit of a CMS for Markdown files. It also can connect directly to GitHub repos, so it can serve from them, which is nice because Markdown is a default format on GitHub. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a162352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162415"></a>PagePark also has a special ability to render <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">OPML</a> files. I use this feature for my this.how site which I've been using to accumulate documents that I want to revise over time. Unlike blog posts, they are not ephemeral. Examples include my <a href="http://this.how/trolls/">Trolling howto</a> and the <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google and HTTP</a> doc. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a162415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162641"></a>So to sum up, what's special about PagePark, for this situation, is that it's really good at rendering OPML documents.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a162641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a163206"></a><a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner</a> is an <a href="http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/">outline editor</a> that runs in a web browser. Its native format is <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">OPML</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a163206" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel2">
	<li><a name="a163318"></a>Every file you edit with <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a> is either public or private. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a163318" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a163354"></a>I have a copy of PagePark running on the same machine as the server that runs Little Outliner. I created a bridge between the two apps, on the server, that allows PagePark to serve from each users' public folder. When you access the page, you'll see a beautifully rendered version, like my this.how documents. Here's an <a href="http://my.this.how/davewiner/example.opml">example</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a163354" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a163455"></a>This might sound complicated, because you've probably never thought of the software that runs these apps. But conceptually it's simple. There's a new bridge between <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a> and <a href="http://pagepark.io/">PagePark</a>. That bridge is a PagePark plug-in.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a163455" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a163814"></a>I've been talking about the new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md">plug-in</a> ability for PagePark. I needed that to create this connection. I've designed a lot of plug-in architectures over many years, and this is a good one. All web servers running in JavaScript should consider doing it <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md#a-plug-in-is-a-module">this way</a>. The plug-in I use for this bridge, is a bit of logic that translates a URL from the outside, to a file in the user's public folder. I've <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/a676b0da36c13576877a91fc77a34ecb">published</a> the source. As you can see, there's not much there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a163814" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="a171447"></a>To really nail it, it turns this <a href="http://storage2.littleoutliner.com/users/davewiner/myOutlines/example.opml">source file</a> into this <a href="http://my.this.how/davewiner/example.opml">rendering</a>. That's it. The next step, soon, will be to present a document that explains how to edit and view these files through the new bridge. If you have questions, post a comment <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/161">here</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a171447" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
