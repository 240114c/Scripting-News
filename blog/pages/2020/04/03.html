HonorÃ©</a> on the fiasco of the medical equipment supply chain.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154429"></a>It sucks that there isn't a wiki-type food ordering app that takes no percentage of sales. I want the money to go to the deliverers and the restaurants. The restaurant would pay a flat monthly fee. At this late date there is no justification for the money the middlemen make.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/03.html#a154429" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a151655"></a>As time goes by more of us will realize the danger we're in. Soon it will be universal. Everyone will feel it. This will have a benefit. Being right doesn't matter as much as we thought. We can be more accepting of ourselves and each other.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/03.html#a151655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a151459"></a>Another thing that will happen, is already happening. More art will flow through the net. It's now the main form of human expression. I predicted this, going back to the beginning. People thought I was nuts. We were building a platform for human expression. Communication with a Big C.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/03.html#a151459" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152449"></a>I predict that this week we will finally realize, the vast majority of Americans, that Trump is a distraction, an impediment, a sideshow. Finally the focus will be where it should have been since January, the virus.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/03.html#a152449" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

What's a few minutes compared to all the waiting we're doing now. It's funny, I could keep developing, nothing in my way, but for the first time in a long time, I can't get the excitement or even the interest to actually do the work. Not that I don't get ideas. I'm much more interested in finding a good online version of Hearts, Sorry or Risk. Or if there were a way to play Wii games online. Now that would be interesting. But I don't want to write the software, thank you very much. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/03.html#a145025" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
