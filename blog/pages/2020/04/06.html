Highly opinionated. Very loud. Didn't spend a lot of time thinking (or so it seemed to me as a child) he just burst into action. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/06/152004.html?title=rudyKiesler#a152007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a152116"></a>Jewish, he was deported in the first rounds of the Nazi regime, leaving my grandmother and mother behind. Lucie, my grandmother, was Lutheran, blonde-haired, blue-eyed Aryan princess. Why they married is something I never understood. They didn't seem to have anything in common.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/06/152004.html?title=rudyKiesler#a152116" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152856"></a>So the women were left in Germany or Czechoslavakia, I'm not clear on which, and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+rudy+kiesler&t=hy&ia=web">Rudy K</a> was in Brooklyn or Queens, setting up a garment business, which he ran until he had a stroke in the 1970s. With no heir wanting to inherit the business, he sold the company, United Pioneer, to <a href="https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/53/Salant-Corporation.html">Salant & Salant</a>. But he was always a bundle of energy, until he drifted away in a nursing home and died in the early 90s.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/06/152004.html?title=rudyKiesler#a152856" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152344"></a>He would not have liked this "stay home stay safe" thing. I can't imagine he would have done it. He was the kind of guy who couldn't stand to wait in a line at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair">World's Fair</a>, so he'd cut in front of the person at the front of the line, and when they complained, he'd ignore them (this actually happened). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/06/152004.html?title=rudyKiesler#a152344" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a151405"></a>It also no longer remembers what tab you had frontmost last time you visited the site. This was always annoying. Not a good heuristic. When I come to scripting.com 99 times out of 100 I want to see the blog. It doesn't matter what I was looking at last time I visited. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/06/151148.html?title=tabsOnScriptingcom#a151405" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
