<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a020919"></a>We can't wait until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration">2021</a> for Trump to leave office. Too many Americans will die needlessly. I don't want to be one of them, do you?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/08.html#a020919" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9GYTc53r2o"><a name="a163945"></a>According to this emergency room <a href="https://twitter.com/cameronks">doctor</a> in NYC, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9GYTc53r2o">Covid-19 is a new disease</a>. Not <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ards/symptoms-causes/syc-20355576">ARDS</a>. The disease is like being dropped at the summit of Mt Everest without <a href="https://www.mounteverest.net/expguide/accli.htm">acclimation</a>. He says the standard treatment hurts the patients.

Pornography of the future. We will watch movies of beautiful happy people in social settings with other beautiful happy people, exchanging in-person conversation, experiencing exotic smells and waves of oxytocin. Multitudes of beautiful, interesting and happy people wander by, exchanging knowing glances and suggestive smiles. No one is wearing a mask. Their faces are literally naked. In public. Naked. Va va voom. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/08.html#a135424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135319"></a>When I sit down at a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1115239756974174208">lovely dinner</a>, with interesting, humor-filled friends in a beautiful spot, I am as rich as I can possibly be. A billionaire couldn't have more. I first realized this at a sushi restaurant in Sausalito, where the chef had prepared the most amazing looking and tasting <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1115618047757254656">bouquet</a> of fresh fish and rice.

It's very bad for our country, in the spirit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE">Jon Stewart's appeal</a> to the Crossfire guys so many years ago. They never did help us, and now <i>thousands of Americans are dying. </i>What will it take to wake the owners of the networks up. And the people, why are you watching this deadly animal garbage? Don't you get it? If you didn't watch they wouldn't broadcast. Don't you care about your own lives?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/08.html#a130028" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
