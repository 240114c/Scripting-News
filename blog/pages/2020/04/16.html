Took a couple of hours all-told. The supermarket was reconfigured with new protocols for moving through the aisles and waiting for checkout. Not too crowded, and almost everything I needed was there. Pasta is now the item in short supply. They had lots of cleaning products, I chose three, but they would only let me by one. I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Freak-Cleaning-Multi-Surface-Starter/dp/B07PHL372F">Clean Freak</a> because I loved the concept and the name. Yes packaging and branding still matter, even in post-apocalypse America. The only bacon they had was maple-flavored. Never heard of such a thing. On coming home I fried some up, and now the whole house smells of maple syrup. Not a good thing imho. Also -- they had toilet paper. Everyone I saw got some. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/16.html#a124952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

My two cents. When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XKoar34gBI">Bernie says</a> "Medicare for All" -- no I don't think so. It's a bastard child. Complicated and convoluted. Obviously something that has been fought over repeatedly in Congress. And in the end, after getting educated, and coming back again and again, I did what everyone seems to, shrug their shoulders, pick a plan and hope for the best.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/16/161733.html?title=signedUpForMedicare#a161800" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a162730"></a>Medicare isn't that. It's way better than I what I've had up till now, ObamaCare, which was a vast improvement over what I had before that (I'd call it Maybe I'm Covered We'll Find Out When I Need It-care). It feels like graduating, finally I get treated like I matter, a little. And I'm pretty sure that if I get in deep shit medically I wll be helped. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/16/161733.html?title=signedUpForMedicare#a162730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a132302"></a>The opening scene has soldiers marching slowly across a very very very long bridge.
