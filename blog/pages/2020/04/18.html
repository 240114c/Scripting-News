It's now the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/18/thelmaLouiseEnd.png">header</a> image <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18.html">here</a>. I didn't like the picture that was there <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/26/lake.png">before</a>, but spring hasn't happened here yet, and until then I have nothing to replace it with. Thelma and Louise should be the default header here, as it is the permanent one on my <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">Twitter feed</a>. BTW, I've been meaning to say this, if you want to get the most out of this <a href="http://scripting.com/">blog</a> you should have an account on Twitter so you can, for example, go there and vote in the polls. Twitter has a useful set of functionality, and they let me use their API and identity system for $0. Pretty good deal. You don't have to do it of course. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üöÄ</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18.html#a141839" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a211117"></a>Look at the units on the Y axis of this <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/18/graph.png">typical graph</a> of the rate of deaths in various countries. If it were drawn to scale, you'd barely be able to see the ones near the bottom.

My mom is on the right, grandmother on the left, brother with his back to the camera. My father probably taking the picture. This was at my college graduation in 1976 at <a href="https://www.commanderspalace.com/">Commander's Palace</a> in New Orleans.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143731"></a>I understand we're at risk of losing journalism. I propose something grand, like what we're doing with the economy. Merge all the different news orgs in America, like the states are linking up at governor level, and then put your heads together and stop doing stuff that makes the problems worse, and get busy with the new reality. Stop duplicating efforts, chasing gotchas, going through the loops with Trump, and making users give each of you their information just to give you money. Reduce friction, build a new journalism we can all be proud of. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18.html#a143731" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a154717"></a>Okay so I decided what my next step would be in my exploration of Glitch, get <a href="http://pagepark.io/">PagePark</a> running there. And I did, and it took about five minutes. I keep trying to get Glitch to put up some resistance, but it doesn't. It really does run Node code, unmodified. When I get it working so quickly I'm dazed and need to retreat a bit and think some more as if I had hit obstacle after obstacle. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18/154707.html?title=glitchDay4#a154717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a154928"></a>I just put a random OPML file there, and it just worked, as it should.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18/154707.html?title=glitchDay4#a154928" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154942"></a>I lied. I did have to make a small mod. After reading the config.json file, I had to add a check to see if process.env.PORT was defined, and if so use that port, instead of the default port. That's how Glitch tells you what port to run on, same way Heroku does. I will add that to the PagePark distribution so it'll run without mods.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18/154707.html?title=glitchDay4#a154942" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155118"></a>Okay so now I know what I want to do next. Find out if they have an API so I can use my own editor to write for this site. And all of a sudden I will have something useful that is shareable. Not bad. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18/154707.html?title=glitchDay4#a155118" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
