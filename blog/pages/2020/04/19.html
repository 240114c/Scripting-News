<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a194602"></a>My <a href="http://pagepark.glitch.me/">server</a> on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18/154707.html?title=glitchDay4">Glitch</a> keeps on rolling. Even with the startup delay it's nice and snappy. Still thinking about where I want to go next. I have to figure out how to get more bits of code running on one instance. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/19.html#a194602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a123905"></a>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html">next in a series</a> of eye-opening NYT pieces from Donald McNeil about the coronavirus. It's mostly about the long miserable slog it's going to be, with one bright spot. "In the movies, viruses become more deadly. In reality, they usually become less so, because asymptomatic strains reach more hosts. Even the 1918 Spanish flu virus eventually faded into the seasonal H1N1 flu."

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a213050"></a>A couple of nights ago I dreamed I was still a smoker, and felt guilty about lying to everyone that I had stopped. In the dream I'm going from store to store looking for my brand. It's so weird, I quit 6519 days ago. Not one cigarette in all that time. So why in my subconscious do I feel like a loser for cheating?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/19.html#a213050" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I thought on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/08.html">March 8</a> it must not be here yet. I had a dinner party that night. Lots of touching, no social distancing. Some people from the small town I live in, some from NYC. Should have been more careful. But it's now 41 days later, and all the guests at the party are well. So I guess we dodged a bullet. On that day.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/19/134046.html?title=isTheVirusHere#a134051" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134125"></a>Nowadays, when I go for a walk, or go to the market, I ask the same question and assume the answer is yes. The virus is here. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/19/134046.html?title=isTheVirusHere#a134125" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a134333"></a>In server programming there's this idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking">tainted text</a>. If it came from outside the server, it could contain executable code. That's how hackers get into our systems, through tainted text. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/19/134046.html?title=isTheVirusHere#a134333" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135053"></a>Now I think about packages from Amazon the same way. I have a physical-world untaint function. I leave them alone for 24 hours. I've heard that the virus will die on cardboard in 24 hours. I assume whatever is inside the box is not dirty, but I think of it as tainted too. It came from outside. It's tainted. I wash my hands after handling it. Then at some point I shrug my shoulders and bless it as part of the house, and not tainted. It's how I maintain a level of sanity. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/19/134046.html?title=isTheVirusHere#a135053" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
