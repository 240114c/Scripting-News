<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160810"></a>Chuck Shotton suggested I look at the Node package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/require-from-string">require-from-string</a> as a good basis for plugins for Node apps. I had done <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md">something similar</a> with plain old require. Here's a <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/3e5454f2b7a10029dfc301d7deabb576">Hello World app</a> I wrote to get an idea how I might use it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/20.html#a160810" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's like the mass shootings. They only count those who were killed. But some people are so damaged they never get to resume anything like a normal life. We'll be living with the (still unknown) after-effects of Covid-19 for a long time to come. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/20.html#a125350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a172010"></a>I record shows I love so I can binge-watch them on my own schedule. Last night I watched the first episode of season 5 of <a href="https://www.amc.com/shows/better-call-saul">Better Call Saul</a>. It was good of course, but the commercials are so dated. Like reading a magazine from the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&sxsrf=ALeKk02kN35WVDHANRMb7Mf6B6dTtrvR0w:1587403615144&q=magazine+from+the+1950s&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwin5eGkw_foAhV8hXIEHUqjAQgQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1256&bih=884">1950s</a>.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134042"></a>Shake Shack returning the $20 million is like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/sports/baseball/chicago-cubs-fans-throw-back-home-run-balls.html">Cubs fans</a> throwing opposing team home runs back on the field. It's American. It will make you beloved. Keeping the money is unfortunately also American.

	<li><a name="a131013"></a>The big failing of the press is they are making an excellent issue of Trump's failure to act in January and February, meanwhile it's almost May, and Trump's government is <i>still failing to act. </i>Which has bigger impact?
