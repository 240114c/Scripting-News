Kobol is the homeworld of the Twelve Colonies in Battlestar Galactica. I've watched the full series twice. But the synopsis on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica">Wikipedia page</a> is riveting. I often forget how simple and beautiful the overall structure of the plot is. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/21/bsgplot.png"><span class="spSpoiler">BSG plot</span></a>. And of course the execution. I'd have to say, even though it has cheezy sets and special effects, it's pretty much a perfect multi-part scifi drama. I just watched The Expanse, which is also good, but BSG is still tops with me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/21.html#a143735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It was in the mid-late 70s when people were still creating new systems in COBOL. It was one of the first attempts to make programming like English instead of like programming, so managers could do it, you wouldn't need programmers. To anyone who really knew about programming, it was obvious that this would not work. People would want features for which there were no human language equivalents, like looping and recursion, nesting, local variables, procedures, closures, objects, async, etc etc. We keep discovering new concepts for which you can't say "this is just like.." COBOL may have been the first programming language to reject programming, but it was not the last. Later attempts include Hypercard and AppleScript. I'm sure there were many others. I've always been most comfortable with Algol-like languages, C, Pascal, JavaScript. My own invented language, UserTalk, is Algol-like. There is a grammar somewhere for UserTalk. I'll find it later. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/21.html#a145110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true"><a name="a191751"></a>This narrative comes from listening to expert explainers on MSNBC last night, mainly <a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-pandemics-path/">Laurie Garrett</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html">Donald McNeil</a>, who was also yesterday's guest on the the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus.html">Daily</a> podcast. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown#a191751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a191830"></a>First, establish strategic testing. Do statistical sampling to form virus outbreak "weather reports," like tracking tornados. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown#a191830" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a191833"></a>If you are in an area where there aren't active outbreaks, you can do a covid-aware resumption of business. Strict limits on size and density of gatherings, so new outbreaks, which will happen, are limited. Makes contact tracing possible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown#a191833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a191836"></a>Where there are outbreaks, do intense contact tracing. Full lockdown except for essential services. Locate people who are infected, and isolate with other spreaders, not with their families. Until the outbreak subsides, then go to 2. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown#a191836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a191844"></a>The testing is never of the whole population, always sampled, and to support contact tracing. Testing forms the basis for the weather reports. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown#a191844" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

This is similar to what they do at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/politics/">538</a> to predict election outcomes. It's also similar to what they do with TV program ratings for advertising, and gathering meteorological data to support weather forecasts. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown#a191845" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
