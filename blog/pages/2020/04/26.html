<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154211"></a>I recently found out there was a season 3 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos_(season_3)">Narcos</a>. Wow. That goes on my list. Also, I thought this season was the last for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul_(season_5)">Better Call Saul</a>. Imagine my surprise when I got to the end, and nothing was resolved. Okay, I'd better survive this virus thing so I can find out what happens to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalo_Salamanca">Lalo</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a32248797/better-call-saul-stars-why-kim-isnt-in-breaking-bad/">Kim</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26.html#a154211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144843"></a>On April 14, a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/26/handSanitizer.jpg">single bottle</a> of hand sanitizer arrived via USPS at my local post office. Ordered via Amazon on March 14. $11.99. Shipped via <a href="http://yjcx.chinapost.com.cn/qps/english/yjcx">China Post</a>, China's equivalent of the USPS. It arrived in Hawthorne, CA on March 24 on its way to my kitchen in upstate NY. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26.html#a144843" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-type="outline"><a name="a182141"></a>I had a pretty terrible <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/24/171231.html?title=dropboxIsKillingItself">Dropbox outage</a> here since Friday, but with <a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Stuck-on-quot-upgrading-dropbox-quot/m-p/414171/highlight/false#M92358">help</a> from Daniel Bradley, I was able to get most of my servers connected to Dropbox again. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/211718.html?title=dropboxLo2Outage#a182141" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a211807"></a>I just noticed that the server for <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">LO2</a> got completely trashed in the process. I have no idea how, but I had a backup from yesterday, which I am now restoring. It may take about an hour or so. Any work done between the outage and the restoration will be lost. Sorry. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/211718.html?title=dropboxLo2Outage#a211807" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a211817"></a>I'm going to have to stop depending on Dropbox. Obviously the Linux version is not a priority for them, it's breaking a lot these days. I've been a Dropbox user since the beginning. But it's been obvious for a few years that this is no longer a good match. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/211718.html?title=dropboxLo2Outage#a211817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline"><a name="a183507"></a>Update: Well that was pretty good <a href="#a182141">outage</a>-wise. Less than 15 minutes. But data <i>was</i> lost. It seems fortunate this happened after I added the <a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1586885920000">backup</a> command. No excuse for not having copies of your files. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/211718.html?title=dropboxLo2Outage#a183507" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a155602"></a>HIV has a very high mutation rate, it's a constantly changing target, very hard to vaccinate. Fortunately this corona virus is highly conserved (stable), there are many stable proteins you can target. We don't see a reason why that <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2012889?query=featured_coronavirus">stability</a> would change as it's already spread around the world. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a155352"></a>I wanted to offer a few reasons for limited, cautious optimism, and one reason for a little bit of pessimism.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a155404"></a>Nobody ever "gets better" from HIV on their own. Our immune systems can't beat it. So it's hard to make a vaccine that teaches our immune systems how to beat it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155404" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155415"></a>We do get better from the flu on our own. But the problem is that the flu is a "modular" virus that can be recombined, so there's always a new version. So flu vaccines work, but there's a new vaccine every year.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155418"></a>Our bodies can beat the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. People usually get better in a few weeks, if they don't die.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155418" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155421"></a>Many people who caught the original SARS-CoV virus in 2003 still had antibodies ~10 years later.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155421" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155407"></a>The SARS viruses are unusually complex, and in order to replicate correctly, they have pretty good proofreading. So they mutate much more slowly than HIV or the flu.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155407" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a155523"></a>But there's also one reason to worry:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel2 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li><a name="a155409"></a>There are four other coronaviruses that cause about 15% of cases of the common cold. We build immunity to these viruses but it usually doesn't last forever.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#a155409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>So as I understand it, the biggest question with SARS-CoV-2 isn't whether we can teach our bodies to beat it. It's how long our immune system will remember. And whether we can find a low-risk vaccine that doesn't cause other problems.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/26/155144.html?title=myLatestFishingExpedition#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
