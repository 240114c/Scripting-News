But <a href="https://twitter.com/American_Bridge/status/1255975047308759040">this</a> is worth quoting. "Our death totals, our numbers, per million people, are really very, very strong.

Science is really good at that these days. Weather reports are amazingly accurate these days. We have to get just as good with tracking virus outbreaks.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/30.html#a235512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a231955"></a>I did a little checking after posting <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/28.html#a220729">this</a>, and it seems <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">request</a> is <i>not</i> being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">deprecated</a>. Rather, they are <a href="https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142">freezing</a> it. Totally legit. But it's safe to keep using it, which is exactly what I plan to do. If they ever take it out, I'm just going to fork it and add it back. I have enough complications to manage in the <s>messes</s> functionality I've created. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/30.html#a231955" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a234454"></a>BTW, if you're writing a Node app that needs to read a feed, I recommend <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread">davefeedread</a>. I wrote it, and I use it. It's stable and pretty well debugged. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/30.html#a234454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135435"></a>Earlier today I went grocery shopping and was surprised at how well-stocked the store was. They actually had <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/handSanitizer.png">hand sanitizer</a> and Lysol cleaning stuff. And I was sure all the meat would have gone, given the problems with meat processing plants, but not so. The <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/checkoutLine.png">checkout line</a> was ridiculously long, but moved quickly. All in all a gratifying experience. PS: I was really scared to do this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/30.html#a135435" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/voila.png"><a name="a142426"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/voila.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">On Twitter it was <a href="https://twitter.com/bloatedlesbian/status/1255697398485180418">suggested</a> that I change the titles of the items in the Cuomo Briefing podcast <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml">feed</a> so each item has a unique title, that it might start working properly in Apple's podcasts app on my iPhone. Note the items in the feed have <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/feedHasGuidsAsYouCanSee.png">proper guid elements</a>, so there should be no need to use the title as a guid, but it seems that Apple's podcast app does, because when I changed the titles of the five most recent episodes, voila -- they show up in the Apple podcasts app. This was suggested on Twitter by <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/og/">OG</a> podcaster <a href="https://twitter.com/bloatedlesbian/status/1255697398485180418">Madge Weinstein</a>. Bottom-line: there appears to be an easy-to-fix bug in Apple's podcasts app on iOS.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/30.html#a142426" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
