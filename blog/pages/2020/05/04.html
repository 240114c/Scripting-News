<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135849"></a>My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live">SNL</a>-awareness is spotty. I didn't learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_McKinnon">Kate McKinnon</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hader">Bill Hader</a> until they had already been on the show for years. Same with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey">Tina Fey</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Poehler">Amy Poehler</a> and so many others. Well, over the weekend, I discovered the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=whiskers+r+we+snl&t=ha&ia=videos&iax=videos">Whiskers R We</a> series. OMG. They're so good. Two lesbian cat rescue ladies, a different partner for McKinnon's character, <a href="https://snl.fandom.com/wiki/Barbara_DeDrew">Barbara DeDrew</a>. every <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=whiskers+r+we+snl&safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&sxsrf=ALeKk00QqZkqKxzHdEIHuVllMw1PVMUFhQ:1588601142929&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjiiMG2sJrpAhUrheAKHSzNBl8Q_AUoAXoECAQQAw&biw=1473&bih=1165">time</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/04.html#a135849" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a133601"></a>Obama put it in context, honestly, sympathetically, passionately, forcefully and presidentially. We need a moment like that, for gender. To validate the grievances of women, but also to test every accusation carefully, with justice, in the way envisioned by our Constitution.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/04/130449.html?title=letsNotSelfdestructThisTime#a133601" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a131118"></a>In something as consequential as a presidential election, there has to be a time when you must speak or forever hold your peace. To make the accusation at the point when it can do the greatest damage not just to the candidate, but to the country, even to the world, we can't allow that. Even if Biden did what he's accused of, the choice of timing, when it was sure to do the greatest damage, is a much greater abuse with much larger consequences. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/04/130449.html?title=letsNotSelfdestructThisTime#a131118" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

With all the death and disease and economic hardship, all the fear and a complete void of leadership in the US government, we can't ignore our own interests. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/04/130449.html?title=letsNotSelfdestructThisTime#a133425" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133923"></a>We have to stay on course to at least have a chance to right this by November if not sooner. This is not the time to stop and self-destruct. We have to be smarter and more willful than that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/04/130449.html?title=letsNotSelfdestructThisTime#a133923" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
