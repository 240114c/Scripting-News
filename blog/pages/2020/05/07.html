First the air pollution was gone. Then there was the spring that never came. Snow in May. Next up, the coral reefs come back to life, occupied by alien beings. It's the first we learn that we aren't alone. They would like to speak to our leader.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/07.html#a162317" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131610"></a>A robocall. "I am calling to speak with David Winer. Are you David?" A computer voice. I hung up. If you want your computer to contact me, use email. (Postscript: I looked up the number, and holy shit, it was a hack. They want to record you saying Yes. Good thing I didn't fall for it.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/07.html#a131610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a133912"></a>I had a storage unit in Berkeley with all kinds of random stuff in it. When I moved to the new house in the mountains, I had a lot of room, so I had the storage unit contents moved out here. There were a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/diskbackups1.png">couple</a> of <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/diskbackups2.png">cartons</a> of backups from Living Videotext and UserLand in the 80s and 90s.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/07/133907.html?title=myBackups#a133912" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134210"></a>I don't have hardware to read any of them, but I'd love to back them up somewhere like the Computer History Museum, or Stanford or MIT, or where ever it makes sense. Happy to make it all open source. I always intended to leave a record behind of some kind. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/07/133907.html?title=myBackups#a134210" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134124"></a>Send me an email if you have any pointers. I would be willing to drive to Boston or NYC if people know where there's hardware. Of course when it's safe to do so, from a virus standpoint. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/07/133907.html?title=myBackups#a134124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134215"></a>This reminds me of a project we did with <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/15/uncleArnosBooks.html">Uncle Arno's books</a> a number of years ago. We did find a home for them at Portland State University. This is different, this is all digital stuff. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/07/133907.html?title=myBackups#a134215" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
