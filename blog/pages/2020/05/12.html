<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182016"></a>In the Supreme Court I love how they talk about the president's massive todo list. This president just eats, farts, watches tv, and throws his poop at the wall.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/12.html#a182016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a120626"></a>There was a <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/05/10/heads_up_to_rss_reader_authors">kerfuffle</a> in the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> world yesterday when it appeared that Apple wanted aggregator developers to get written permission from sites whose feeds they include as defaults. It appears this was an error, or Apple changed their mind. Also, I love the word <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=kerfuffle">kerfuffle</a>. Surprisingly, it's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kerfuffle">not the first time</a> I've used it, according to Google. I'm surprised. But it appears to be the first time <i>in 13 years. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/12.html#a120626" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a120123"></a>As you <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-fauci-cdc-director-testify-in-senate-hearing-on-how-to-safely-return-to-work-and-school">watch</a> Fauci today imagine if he were on every day.  Maybe it's because I'm a former entrepreneur that I see <i>tons</i> of ways to do this.   Biden, for example, could give Fauci a pulpit. I've tried this idea out of people inside the Democratic Party, they say this just isn't done. And that's a reason not to do something? Bill Gates could do it. He's entrepreneurial. It doesn't have to be Fauci himself, any affable avuncular scientist who tells the truth. As Trump fades into oblivion we should fill the airwaves with facts. That's a good way to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&t=h_&ia=web">save my life</a>. ðŸ˜‡<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/12.html#a120123" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
