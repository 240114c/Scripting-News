<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145623"></a>It seems fair if a news org can keep us from reading their articles, that we should be able to tell Twitter orX Facebook not to show us their links.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a214053"></a>Maybe only "essential" workers should have jobs, everyone else could get a government grant monthly and hang out and read books and learn to play the guitar.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125730"></a>Someone should be working on a virtual political rally where people in the audience can make noise, clap, laugh, chant etc. I think the net is up to it.

The first half is a pretty good dramatization of Covid, then it goes off the rails. I do not like the blogger, btw, or Elliot Gould who says bloggers aren't writers. It's probably not his fault, someone wrote that line for him. A writer, of course.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/14.html#a125800" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

For some reason when I linked to this piece <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1260726497532354563">on Twitter</a>, it got a relatively large number of RTs and Likes. For some reason people found this interesting. I'm trying to link to more local Ulster County news, as more people in the area are tuning into my blog.

	<li><a name="a130241"></a>I went for a ride yesterday along the <a href="https://ashokanrailtrail.com/">Ashokan Rail Trail</a>, a very nice bike and walking trail, alongside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashokan_Reservoir">Ashokan Reservoir</a>, which, believe it or not, is part of NYC. 1/6 of the water for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_water_supply_system">city</a> comes from this <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/101552.html">body</a> of water.

I was wearing a mask, I actually like the warmth and moisture. I also like the civics of it. But it pisses me off when people don't reciprocate. It means their viruses are spewing all over everyone else, including me, and possibly into my body, and might possibly cause me to get sick or worse.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/14/130229.html?title=unmaskedOnTheRailTrail#a130317" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a130541"></a>This trail is just 15 minutes from where I live. I have a nice bike rack on my car, so it's easy for me to get there. That said, I think the riding where I live is better. I live in paradise even compared to another nearby paradise. And most of the people around here wear masks and they keep them on their faces!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/14/130229.html?title=unmaskedOnTheRailTrail#a130541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
