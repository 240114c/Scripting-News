<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a132610"></a>In news everything is a race between two political parties. The reds and the blues. There are other perspectives, for example I have the perspective of a citizen: voter, taxpayer, juror, soldier (according to the president), and now -- possibly infected, transmitting, part of a death toll. Yesterday's <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/politics/coronavirus-whistleblower-testimony/index.html">testimony</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bright">Rick Bright</a> wasn't just a scandal, as much of journalism characterized it, it was also a clear statement that the US government isn't doing anything to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&t=h_&ia=web">save my life</a>. That should have been the headline. We are being rolled over by a killer. <i>No one is driving the bus. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/15.html#a132610" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a212928"></a>Perspective is everything. I'd love to see just one publication adopt the perspective of the people even if just for a little while. Do something shocking. Report from the perspective of the voter, taxpayer, governed. Always say what the news means to us.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/15.html#a212928" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's only a horse race if you choose to view it that way. Sometimes there are other more important perspectives (see above).  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/15.html#a132924" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a005146"></a>Trump's promise about the vaccine recalls promises about his tax returns. The end of the year is also after the election. At that point, either way, he'll have no need to follow-through on this, as with the tax returns. He'll say he never thought there was going to be a vaccine.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/15.html#a005146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
