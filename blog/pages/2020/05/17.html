<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a222716"></a>There's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/17/cuomoPodcastImage.png">new graphic</a> for the <a href="http://this.how/cuomo/">Cuomo Briefing Podcast</a>. I thought about putting some text on it, but decided a simple color picture of the governor was sufficient. If people want to give it a try, send me your version. I'm totally open to improvements. BTW <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/04/cuomoBriefing.png">this</a> is the original version. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/17.html#a222716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a172254"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/172">Braintrust query</a>. I'm getting what appears to be an internal error with NPM. Others have reported same problem. Looking for a fix or workaround. Help much appreciated. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/17.html#a172254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
