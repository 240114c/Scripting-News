<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180651"></a>Taking it easy today, not much writing or programming. The weather has turned gorgeous, real upstate NY summer weather. After a long winter and an even longer almost-spring, including snow on May 9, and a pandemic, it's pretty ecstatic weather, luxurious, great-to-be-alive type weather. It's the contrasts that make the eastern part of the US so much more livable than the west, say I, a native son of the east who spent many years in the west.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/24.html#a180651" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/24/homecoming.png"><a name="a180909"></a><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/24/homecoming.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm always looking for a good binge, and I found one. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming_(TV_series)">second season</a> of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/homecoming-season-2-review.html">Homecoming</a> is out, on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085SW2PFQ/?ref=dvm_us_dl_sl_go_ast_522HO|m_2aaNnzkwc_c436988553276&gclid=CjwKCAjwtqj2BRBYEiwAqfzur97nIZDGWdlC1jUutPGDdtug_T52f__inue8ztQOoGDGkQsFlYfKrBoCP3oQAvD_BwE">Amazon</a>. I started it the other night instead of watching the news. I had forgotten most of the plot of the first season, I remember liking it, but it didn't leave much of an impression. The second season is nicely done, has a Mr Robotish feel, there's a constant stream of twists and surprises, it's fun and so far intellectually gratifying, and it reviews the plot of season 1 as it goes. We have an inkling of how it will end because the first episode is about how it ends, or so we are led to believe. I don't know otherwise because I still have a few episodes to go. But nothing in this show is a straight line, and as I said it's well done. I especially like the end of each episode. They end with a twist, but they stay wtih the scene as the credits roll. I had not seen this technique before. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/24.html#a180909" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I've been working in Node for seven years so far and it hasn't affected me yet. So they must not be heavy earth-shaking things.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/24.html#a215929" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
