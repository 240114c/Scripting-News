			<description>If you get a chance, please listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1224428088953581569&quot;&gt;Adam Schiff's closing speech&lt;/a&gt; in the impeachment trial. I have a feeling a lot of people didn't hear this historic, passionate plea for America. The Repubs in Congress aren't listening, but we imho must. It's really right up there with JFK's inauguration speech in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy&quot;&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Schiff and the House Democrats for standing up for America.</description>

			<description>Complaining that Bloomberg is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbc-contributor-clashes-with-bernie-campaign-co-chair-nina-turner-after-she-blasts-bloomberg-as-an-oligarch/&quot;&gt;oligarch&lt;/a&gt; in the age of Citizens United is like (I was trying to think of an analogy and failed) ridiculous. Of course he's an oligarch. And his ads are good Democratic values ads. He knows how to market. Kick back and thank god someone does. (This was the beginning of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1224522337288171522&quot;&gt;long rant&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. Enjoy!)</description>

			<description>I used to call for presidential candidates to try to work with Repubs, but that's changed since Friday's vote re evidence for impeachment. They are complicit, as corrupt as the president. There is no working with any Republican who is in Congress at this time.</description>

			<description>Over on Facebook Terry Heaton &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/03/terry.png&quot;&gt;posted a screed&lt;/a&gt; in support of Jennifer Lopez in last night's SuperBowl halftime show. To me it was a big meh. I find those kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows#1960s&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; unimpressive, the music not interesting. I came to watch football, not dance. I'm not kidding. Even Prince, the Stones, Bruce, etc didn't get me off. I was in the kitchen during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrobe_malfunction&quot;&gt;wardrobe malfunction&lt;/a&gt;. But -- Terry's post is noteworthy because he ends it with this line: &quot;America is facing the destruction of our democracy, and we're worried about this?&quot; We should make a button out of that. Tatoo it on our forehead so we see it in the mirror. We need to be &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; to each other, find ways to combine our power, not minimize it. Let's go Mets! and thanks for listening.</description>

			<description>It turns out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150#issuecomment-581407743&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; of the problem that a user was experiencing with the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/privacybadger&quot;&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; from EFF. I gather it's something that a user can disable, so if you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; and you're running Privacy Badger, you should disable their distrust of scripting.com and then LO2 should work as it should.</description>

			<description>What's really sad is that the user doesn't get an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/03/privacyBadgerMessage.png&quot;&gt;error message&lt;/a&gt; that they can pass on to support so we can avoid having the user go to the JavaScript console (an unnatural act for most of our users) to find the error that's causing the app not to load.</description>

			<description>I have to say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&quot;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; has been a constant bummer and pain in the ass. For an organization that I should be able to support (and have, see below), they are always doing shit like this. When they sued the guy who claimed to have invented podcasting, they didn't respond to my emails or blog posts begging them not to take the approach they took. I felt it's important to get on the record how media types like podcasting come about. They didn't care. So much for being on the electronic frontier. It seems to me we should be on the same side in everything, and when we're not we should listen to each other. I gave the EFF $5K, which was then and is now a lot of money for me, when they were founded by Mitch Kapor, John Gilmor and John Perry Barlow, in 1990. I believe in the mission, but often do not believe in the implementation. Thanks for listening.</description>

			<description>The only football team I've ever been a fan of, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers&quot;&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;, is in tonight's SuperBowl. I'm angry and frustrated that the NFL won't hire former Niners quarterback &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick&quot;&gt;Colin Kaepernick&lt;/a&gt;. I also remember the intellect, wisdom, character, professionalism, talent and luck of the Niners of the 80s and 90s. So just for tonight, I'll be a football fan again. Go Niners! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🏈&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, to tech-savvy users who are regulars here. Please pitch in and help test the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/01.html#a174348&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub, the problems tend to be technical, though the typical user of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cribsheet.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; is not. If you've looked for a way to pitch in, this is where I need the most help. Keep an outline on &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. When there's a new release try editing it. Do the changes stick when you reload the page? Try creating a new outline. Open an existing one. Log off and log on. Go through the menus and try all the commands. We're looking for breakage, something that used to work but because of changes doesn't work now. A lot of stuff changed in this release. But most of it isn't visible to users. Help me out. This is foundational work. I need LO2 to work for people, smoothly. Thanks.</description>

As you can see from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub, the problems tend to be technical, though the typical user of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cribsheet.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; is not. If you've looked for a way to pitch in, this is where I need the most help. Keep an outline on &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. When there's a new release try editing it. Do the changes stick when you reload the page? Try creating a new outline. Open an existing one. Log off and log on. Go through the menus and try all the commands. We're looking for breakage, something that used to work but because of changes doesn't work now. A lot of stuff changed in this release. But most of it isn't visible to users. Help me out. This is foundational work. I need LO2 to work for people, smoothly. Thanks." created="Sun, 02 Feb 2020 19:20:32 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/02.html#a192032"/>

			<description>Trump is picking a fight with Michael Bloomberg, re his height. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ginasmith888/status/1224037007673815040&quot;&gt;Gina Smith&lt;/a&gt; points out that Bloomberg is an inch taller than Putin. Heh. And then I read that Bloomberg's spokesperson, Julie Wood (a woman, this is important) said this: &quot;The president is lying. He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity, and his spray-on tan.&quot;  You know, this is the first time in four years Trump has been in presidential politics, talking about people's bodies and demeanor, that someone has come back at him with this line of attack, which is totally valid. When you're being bullied by someone so obviously vulnerable, give it back to him. It's even &lt;s&gt;worse&lt;/s&gt; better when a woman says a man is a liar, bald, fat, and wears makeup. Trust me on that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Bojack finale, initial thoughts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Quick thoughts on the finale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6&quot;&gt;Bojack&lt;/a&gt;. Spoilers follow. I think they planned the second-to-last episode as the actual final episode. Had they done that I would have said who ever thought a comedy like Bojack Horseman would try something so ambitious, and even better, pull it off. But they added one more plot twist, it's really hard to parse, and the rest of the final episode is weird and repetitive, and at the end punts the ending. Still a groundbreaking show that's often LOL funny. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/whyYouMustWatchBojackHorseman.html&quot;&gt;wish&lt;/a&gt; all my friends would watch it so we can talk about it. Now I'll take some time and read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What about the courts?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering how the courts will incorporate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump&quot;&gt;Senate's decision&lt;/a&gt; into their interpretation of the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Will they judge the executive as if the president is a monarch now?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They can't overrule the Senate, that seems clear from the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another question. What will the Repubs in the Senate do if/when Trump pushes the boundaries. For example, suppose he has a journalist killed. Lots of witnesses. He admits it. Assuming the House impeaches him, what does the Senate do? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A less radical hypothetical. What if he arrests Hillary Clinton for interfering with his re-election. Seems likely that will go to court. Say the Supreme Court rules this is illegal or unconstitutional. Will Trump respect that even though the Senate appears to have said it's OK.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagine the scholars and judges are thinking about this now. This has been a precedent-setting trial. If they actually do acquit him when no one contests the truth, it appears the only part of the government that objects is the House. It seems the question will be raised in the courts as well. It'll appear on Roberts' desk before too long. Is the president really a king?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="They can't overrule the Senate, that seems clear from the Constitution." created="Sat, 01 Feb 2020 20:18:24 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a201824"/>
				<source:outline text="Another question. What will the Repubs in the Senate do if/when Trump pushes the boundaries. For example, suppose he has a journalist killed. Lots of witnesses. He admits it. Assuming the House impeaches him, what does the Senate do?" created="Sat, 01 Feb 2020 20:18:24 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a201824"/>
				<source:outline text="A less radical hypothetical. What if he arrests Hillary Clinton for interfering with his re-election. Seems likely that will go to court. Say the Supreme Court rules this is illegal or unconstitutional. Will Trump respect that even though the Senate appears to have said it's OK." created="Sat, 01 Feb 2020 20:19:15 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a201915"/>
				<source:outline text="I imagine the scholars and judges are thinking about this now. This has been a precedent-setting trial. If they actually do acquit him when no one contests the truth, it appears the only part of the government that objects is the House. It seems the question will be raised in the courts as well. It'll appear on Roberts' desk before too long. Is the president really a king?" created="Sat, 01 Feb 2020 20:25:38 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01/201752.html?title=whatAboutTheCourts#a202538"/>
