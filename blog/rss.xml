			<description>Dear &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1212954848666234880&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is ridiculous. Why can't we use the native text capabilities that all our computers and mobile devices have? This is an embarrassment not just for Twitter, but for the entire tech community. We &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to do better than this.</description>

			<description>I was asked what I said in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/03.html&quot;&gt;March 2003&lt;/a&gt; as the war in Iraq started. That's why I have a blog. Not only can you see what I said, but I included what lots of other people said too.</description>

			<description>I want to clear something up. I do not equate the net with Facebook. However a lot of people do.  That's where you have to meet them. If you want to go forward with them, Facebook is where they are. Why do you rob banks? That's where the money is. ;-)</description>

			<title>When we talk about Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/04/05/HailThis.html#2&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The press only knows three stories, Apple is dead, Microsoft is evil, and Java is the future.&quot; In 2020, Apple is alive, no one worries about Microsoft's character, and Java is no longer the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Facebook? According to journalism, Facebook is a bad place. Facebook is a place you don't want to go. Reality is as the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/yogi_berra_100418&quot;&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt; said: &quot;No one goes there anymore, it's too crowded.&quot; That's Facebook. It isn't any one thing, it's everything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The scale of Facebook is hard to imagine. To say Facebook is like a low-life bar (something one of my correspondents on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/olivermarks/status/1213146774996541440&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;) would be like saying NYC is a low-life bar -- ridiculous -- NYC has 8.6 million people. It has art museums, libraries, great restaurants, office buildings, millions of homes and families to go with them. Two baseball stadiums. Two airports. Dozens of schools and universities. It's a big place but Facebook is much much much bigger. Let's say Facebook has a billion users. That means it's 125 times the size of NYC. The people who go to Facebook are not low-lifers, they're your friends and family, colleagues, classmates, people in power, retired people, rich and poor, from every continent. What is happening on Facebook? Does anyone have the slightest idea? Even the Facebook company probably only has a very aggregated view of what goes on there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a hunch that Facebook is where journalism is rebooting. I know we're supposed to scoff at the idea of people doing it for themselves, helping each other get the info they need, but if there's going to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjr.org/local_news/american-news-deserts-donuts-local.php&quot;&gt;local news desert&lt;/a&gt;, something has to fill the gap. Just because professional journalism is leaving localities (which includes non-geographic locales like industries and professions), does that mean we must live without journalism? I think not. We need journalism, and we'll have it, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Professional journalism does not respect online. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/social-media-2020.html&quot;&gt;Farhad Manjoo's latest&lt;/a&gt;. What a trip. Some of my friends in Woodstock don't use Facebook for the reasons he outlines. Why? Because they heard it from him, or another NYT reporter or columnist, and believed it. My friends didn't find this out themselves, because if they looked, asked for pointers from friends (for example me), they would have found their people there. If they hang out with evil people, that's probably what they'd find. Or if they live with aging hippies (as in the place I live now) then that's what they'd find. Billions of people can't all be as bad and stupid as a columnist in the NYT says they are. And remember that Manjoo has reasons to want you not to like Facebook. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something&quot;&gt;salary&lt;/a&gt; depends on it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Inline images in Old School</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Wherein I report a new feature added yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yesterday I added a new image type to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;, the blogging platform I use to publish &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. I can now add an image to a post that is not in the right margin, it's centered on the page, above the text that serves as its caption. This is an example of such a post. Then I added a nice border, and padding, and made the text a bit smaller to be more like a caption. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism has some people believing that there's nothing good about online. That they should stay away from Facebook. It's not safe. But it's where people go now. Billions. I'm not happy about that, but it is what it is. Saying online is dangerous is like saying the subway is dangerous. But if you live in New York, you probably want to take the subway. Driving is dangerous. Everything is. Life itself isn't safe. It's a mix. You have to learn to discern. But most people are good, and most people are on Facebook. And it pisses me off that a few of my neighbors won't use Facebook, and when I ask why, they repeat the talking points of the journalists, almost verbatim. We perceive the world of today as being more dangerous than the world we grew up in. In fact, today's world is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/14/theres-never-been-a-safer-time-to-be-a-kid-in-america/?noredirect=on&quot;&gt;much safer&lt;/a&gt;. Perceptions that come from listening to journalism too much. It seems, knowing this, it would be responsible to temper their promotion of fear. It creates an obstacle we have to overcome. But they keep at it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/social-media-2020.html&quot;&gt;Stay away little person&lt;/a&gt;. Online is dangerous. Better to stay safe.</description>

			<description>If the NYT covered NYC as they cover FB they would never run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/sports/carmelo-anthony-knicks-trailblazers.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; like this about the Knicks. What they fail to convey in their reporting, probably because they don't feel it, is that FB is much larger than NYC. And as diverse and interesting.</description>

			<description>Speaking of Facebook, yesterday I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1123011587906245&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; intended to be wistful and introspective that some people took as a cry for help. Funny how that works. I said this: &quot;Honestly I never thought Iâ€™d make it to 2020.&quot; Now it's 100 percent my fault there was confusion. Going back to the 1960s, when we had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_cover&quot;&gt;duck and cover drills&lt;/a&gt; in school, we all thought for sure we'd die in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust&quot;&gt;nuclear holocaust&lt;/a&gt; long before 2020. If you had asked me then what were the chances I'd be alive in 2020, I probably would have said &quot;No one will be alive in 2020.&quot; But here we are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Soon we'll be able to write the epitaph of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; as a basketball player. If I were to write it today it'd go like this. Melo is not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;LeBron&lt;/a&gt; and he's not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Smith&quot;&gt;JR Smith&lt;/a&gt;. LeBron is a general, a warrior. JR Smith is a joker, prankster, doper, partier. All three can shoot like nobody's business. Melo is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever&quot;&gt;Black Lab&lt;/a&gt;. He's a pet. He should have been teamed up with LeBron or someone like him. He'd make a great #2. But he was miscast as the hero of the Knicks, so the Melo Knicks were losers. But because he's so sweet and he has a great shot, New York loves Melo.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;This cartoon comes closest to describing the dismay of people who did not vote for Trump about people who did. No matter what you may believe, how could crashing the country possibly be better than trying to work together? I'm not talking about parties working together, or news networks, I'm talking about people, American-to-American.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
