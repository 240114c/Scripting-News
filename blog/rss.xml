			<description>New version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/publicfolder#readme&quot;&gt;publicFolder&lt;/a&gt;, a Node app that runs on your desktop and keeps an Amazon S3 location in sync with a folder on a local disk. It's available as an NPM package and an Electron app. I use it to publish this.how, and am starting to use it in place of Dropbox. Much lighter weight, and I have all the source (and so do you).</description>

			<description>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Forester&quot;&gt;Subaru Forester&lt;/a&gt;. Nice car. But every so often the rear door refuses to open. Three beeps. So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=subaru+forester+open+rear+gate&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=subaru+forester+open+rear+gate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l6j69i61.12667j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt;, have trouble finding an answer. So confusing, they talk about buttons my car doesn't seem to have. Anyway it turns out if you hold the touch point for six seconds it'll open the rear door. Software glitch of some kind. From then on it works as normal. Wonder what the logic is. If it has the means to reset itself why doesn't it just reset itself without me having to jump through hoops?</description>

			<description>On Maddow last night an interesting observation as to why meat packing plants are even worse than we thought. Recall that enclosed spaces with lots of humans present for long periods of time are bad. The virus has plenty of time to become dense, which it needs to be infectious. But meat packing plants are also loud, lots of machinery, so people have to yell to be heard. And when an infected person yells they emit more virus, contributing to greater density, therefore more transmission.</description>

			<title>Virus in summertime?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+matt+ocko&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Matt Ocko&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattocko/status/1263795877103071233&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it's hot in Brazil and they have a lot of virus there, so the virus must do okay in heat, so therefore no reprieve during the summer in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether the virus does better or worse in summer months, but saying it's doing fine in Brazil doesn't add much data about how it will do in the US in the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the virus doesn't care about the heat, but humans behave differently when it's warm. We spend more time outdoors, and the virus isn't as infectious outdoors, because it's the virus &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1263787622859771904&quot;&gt;load&lt;/a&gt; that determines how infectious it is. At least that's what we currently think.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Human bodies are generally in better shape in the summer. That might make us better able to fight the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Brazil is a different place from the US and is responding socially to the virus differently, so it's hard to conclude anything about what happens in the US based on what happens in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course the US is a very varied country, so what happens in NYC is different from what happens in Calif, is different from other parts of New York State for that matter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't see the point of a presidential campaign. There's no way it can rise above our focus on the virus. Everything in the campaign should go to saving lives, just as journalism wastes our attention on the horse race. The war is &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; American now. This isn't some far-away thing. It's killing Americans. Now.</description>

			<description>I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; in the month after my father's death in 2009. I call that event &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/03/fathersDay.html&quot;&gt;Father's Day&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. Anyway, I know someone who lost her father last week, to CV, and wanted to share my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt; of a talk by Bruce Sterling. It's about the big moments in our life when change is more than something we dream about. It seems this is a door that's opening for all of us now, so why not post it publicly. And thanks to Sterling for putting this idea out there, so eloquently.</description>

			<description>Gatekeepers pass on ideas from people they respect and not people they don't. It's natural. I do it too. But I've been wrong a number of times this way, and then missed out on important ideas. So I try to pay attention to unusual thinking whether or not I like the person doing the talking. It can be hard to overcome judgement, but it's often worth trying.</description>

			<title>State of the virus</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's where we're at with the virus in mid-May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Top line: It makes no sense to &quot;reopen&quot; from the lockdown in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the lockdown was to freeze everything so we could get our act together. To monitor outbreaks of the virus the same way we track the weather. It's not the testing itself that's so important, it's the weather report. There are other methods, like sampling the sewage a community creates. We have to know where the trouble spots are so we can respond. It's like the map of battlefields in a war. We can't respond if we don't know where the outbreaks are, and right now, we don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once an outbreak happens we lock that community down, the same way people would shelter if there were tornoados forecast or a blizzard, or fires like the ones they have in California and Australia. How long do they stay locked down? Until the outbreak is over. People need to be ready for this and that's accomplished through communication and trust. In the US our leaders are not trustworthy and they are removing channels of communication.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to isolate people who are infected. Sending them back to their family just means the family members are likely to get infected, feeding the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the US, none of this is working. We can't track outbreaks, there is no weather report. We can't isolate people who are infected. We're still at the beginning, more or less where we were in March, though the virus is distributed all around the country now. Most people don't know how dangerous the virus is. The communication field is flooded with lies from the government. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're going to have to hit the wall repeatedly until the people understand how this works. Countries in Asia had an advantage, they had to deal with recent pandemics that never made it to the US, presumably because our health systems and political leaders kept us safe without us being aware. We can't seem to learn from their experience, we will have to go through it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're reopening because we don't know better. Our government included. There will be new spikes, more sickness, suffering, incapacity, death. The economy will go into a deeper recession, which will be harder to recover from. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was talking with an old software developer friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22don+park%22&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Don Park&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. First project we did together was in 1988. He did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/15.html#a141614&quot;&gt;Mac INIT&lt;/a&gt; that enabled interprocess communication. It was part of the foundation we built &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on. We got around to JavaScript and he said I should make packages anyone can use. I said Don I do! No one knows about them, he said. Yeah, but I tell them. Heh. Maybe I should be doing PR. Finding the bloggers who are most influential about new packages that make JavaScript developers lives' easier and more interesting. Anyway, to start, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1262801291597791235&quot;&gt;sent&lt;/a&gt; Don a pointer to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread&quot;&gt;davefeedread package&lt;/a&gt;. It's a Node package that makes it &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt; and fast to read a feed. Any flavor of RSS or Atom. GIve it a URL and it calls back with a JavaScript object for the whole feed. Includes a simple example, sort of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedRead/blob/master/examples/readurl/read.js&quot;&gt;Hello World of feed reading&lt;/a&gt;. What you do from there is up to your imagination. It's the easiest way to read a feed in Node. A good place to start. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

To get infected there has to be a high density of virus and you have to be there for a relatively long time. Distance isn't the only important thing.

He says yes, it's the area under the curve that determines the infection rate.</description>

			<title>JavaScript is getting away from worse-is-better</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been programming almost exclusively in JavaScript since 2013. I’ve mastered callbacks, have no use for promises and most of the other fancy new stuff. I believe in minimal languages. The bloat in JavaScript is undermining what was attractive about it, it was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/chinesehouseholdrevisited.html#5&quot;&gt;consensus platform&lt;/a&gt;. Having a common syntax for programming cuts costs, makes it easier and therefore more likely to share ideas, and avoid the setbacks that come from reinventing the wheel. Now it's splitting up into a lot of different syntaxes. We're getting close to where we were before everything coalesced around JavaScript. It takes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;worse-is-better&lt;/a&gt; language to be the consensus. As a messy hairball that means different things to different people, it doesn't serve much of a purpose at all. However, I am invested, and am sticking with the core syntax I use, maybe others will do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Viruses in both worlds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Viruses on computers and viruses in the real world are interesting to compare. Right now I don't know if my computer, a Mac, has a virus, but there are no obvious symptoms of it being infected. That does  not mean it's not infected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When there's a virus going around, it screws up everything. Back in the 00s when viruses were running wild on Windows machines, I was a Windows user. Over time you learned how to defend against them. For example, when they offer you an ad-free version of an app, you say no. That was just the beginning. We were always trying to keep our computers virus-free, but eventually the viruses would figure out a way around our defenses, and we'd be spending all our time fighting it, until we got our machine uninfected, or at least without symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, the way we're dealing with the new coronavirus is the way computer newbies deal with computer viruses. I know because I have supported a virus neophyte, my mom. The current US govt is behaving pretty much the way she would. She didn't want to learn the rules, and she wanted to pretend it was okay, get back to business as usual (checking her email, writing a blog post). All the while she's got something watching and recording her every move and looking for a chance to infect some other computer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Programming milestone</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just got something neat working, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; integrated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foreversd/forever#readme&quot;&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt;. So now I can create a sub-folder of the domains folder, and put a Node app in it. PagePark will see it when it boots, and launch the app with Forever, running as a package, with no UI. PagePark tells it what port to run on via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-process-env-PORT-in-Node-js&quot;&gt;process.env.PORT&lt;/a&gt;, which is a standard. That's how PagePark, which is foremost an HTTP server, knows how to route requests to the app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always suspected this is where Forever belongs, but it took a few iterations over a couple of years to get to this place. The pieces all snap in place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further, I did it on a server without Dropbox running on it. The Linux version of Dropbox appears to be an unmaintained mess. It feels so much more solid not depending on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>An observation about servers on Node.js. Node is optimized for servers that handle millions of requests an hour -- to run services like Google and Facebook. Billions of users. But Node is most often used by services with far fewer users. Tradeoffs are everything in software. There should be popular server software, based on JavaScript, that creates more reliable, debuggable, easier to write servers, for the loads most people really have.</description>

			<title>Examples of #savemylife journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spoke for an hour yesterday with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nakedjen.com/&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; in Salt Lake City. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic there is very different from how it is where I live. Even though I moved to the country, I still live very much in the influence of NYC, which has suffered greatly. Massachusetts is less than an hour away by car, has been hit hard too. But in the mountain west, where Jen lives, a Republican territory, they &lt;i&gt;aren't&lt;/i&gt; hunkered down like we are. Jen and her family of course are. They're smart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My conclusion has been this: we're going to have to hit the wall a couple more times before everyone understands how frightfully scary and unknown this virus is. It would help if the US government were leading, but that wouldn't be enough. People who were terrified by 9/11 certainly have the capacity to understand the danger of the virus, they just haven't seen it yet. They will, I'm sure of it, because there's no other way out of the conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think everyone should read three bits of writing before they risk their lives or those of others before trying to resume their former lives. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/opinion/coronavirus-young-people.html&quot;&gt;Mara Gay's first person account&lt;/a&gt; of getting and &quot;surviving&quot; the virus in the NYT. She's young, fit, got the disease in mid-April, and it's destroyed her health. That's not too strong a word based on her account. People may not know this isn't binary, you don't just live or die. Some people survive and have lingering incapacity. How long does it last? &lt;i&gt;No one knows. &lt;/i&gt;We are exploring uncharted territory in the US because other countries halted the pandemic before they got to the stage we're at. I hope she fully recovers. I'm worried that she won't. She tells a powerful story. Uses her position on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/opinion/editorialboard.html&quot;&gt;Editorial Board&lt;/a&gt; of the Times in a noble way, in a blogger's way, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of bloggers, you should also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zeldman.com/2020/05/16/its-a-good-day/&quot;&gt;Zeldman's account&lt;/a&gt; of getting Covid-19 in mid-February and still is incapacitated. His daughter has it too. He's going through the same thing, though he's considerably older than Gay. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A random thought. We're hearing about younger people, some very young, who are having horrific experiences. Why aren't we hearing these stories from older people? Possibly the older people don't survive to become incapacitated. Maybe Covid-19 is long-term a young person's disease after all. Remember it isn't binary. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more must-read piece -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/amid-the-coronavirus-crisis-a-regimen-for-reentry&quot;&gt;Atul Gawande's checklist&lt;/a&gt; of how medical personnel in Boston are avoiding getting the infection. It's not any one thing, they do it by carefully incorporating the techniques the CDC recommended before they were silenced by the US government, the ones followed by the winners, South Korea, Taiwan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/02/145311.html?title=coronavirusInVietnam&quot;&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, China. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All three pieces fall strongly into the category of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt; journalism. Rather than inciting fear, Gawande shows us how to calmly and systematically increase our odds of not getting the disease. If I could make reading these pieces a requirement to continue reading my blog, I would. I want the smartest readers. Being smart is an investment, you learn what others are learning and think and do what you have to to protect yourself and others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Stay safe and wash your hands! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/17/cuomoPodcastImage.png&quot;&gt;new graphic&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo Briefing Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I thought about putting some text on it, but decided a simple color picture of the governor was sufficient. If people want to give it a try, send me your version. I'm totally open to improvements. BTW &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/04/cuomoBriefing.png&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the original version.</description>

			<title>Bike ride notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Huge number of sirens near my house in the country earlier this afternoon. Really frightening and weird. Later on my daily ride, I figured out what it was. There were signs on the road about a birthday celebration. Obviously all the emergency vehicles were wishing the person a happy birthday. It was a huge demonstration. I speak from having lived in midtown Manhattan, how surprising to hear something so loud, like that in the country. When I was trying to figure out what it was earlier the only thing I could think of was that there had been a terrorist attack, a very large one. But here? In the middle of nowhere? It's not a good thing to disturb the peace like that, especially in such a peaceful place.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4ev-H_XBQQ&quot;&gt;ride&lt;/a&gt; today I came across a lot of walkers and riders, I was the &lt;i&gt;only one&lt;/i&gt; wearing a mask. That's not a good feeling, gotta say -- I did my part to protect them, but they didn't reciprocate. Not one person wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's not a good thing to disturb the peace like that, especially in such a peaceful place." created="Sat, 16 May 2020 21:18:42 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/16/bike.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/16/211821.html?title=bikeRideNotes#a211842"/>

That's not a good feeling, gotta say -- I did my part to protect them, but they didn't reciprocate.

			<description>In news everything is a race between two political parties. The reds and the blues. There are other perspectives, for example I have the perspective of a citizen: voter, taxpayer, juror, soldier (according to the president), and now -- possibly infected, transmitting, part of a death toll. Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/politics/coronavirus-whistleblower-testimony/index.html&quot;&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bright&quot;&gt;Rick Bright&lt;/a&gt; wasn't just a scandal, as much of journalism characterized it, it was also a clear statement that the US government isn't doing anything to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;. That should have been the headline. We are being rolled over by a killer. &lt;i&gt;No one is driving the bus. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Trump's promise about the vaccine recalls promises about his tax returns. The end of the year is also after the election. At that point, either way, he'll have no need to follow-through on this, as with the tax returns. He'll say he never thought there was going to be a vaccine.</description>

Air enters in the ceiling and exits through the floor.
