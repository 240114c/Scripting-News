			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tone-deaf&quot;&gt;Tone-deaf&lt;/a&gt; means something in music, but in politics it's bullshit. There are lots of points of view. Saying something is tone-deaf means you don't agree. Why can't you just say it that way? Why do you have to insult the person? To me it says you're not really confident in your own beliefs. In speech the only thing that's really tone-deaf is saying some else is tone-deaf.</description>

			<description>Blocking people from reading things posted publicly is weird. You can always get around it by viewing the same page in a different browser or an incognito tab. Something is public or not. If it's public it seems everyone should just be able to read it without phony barriers.</description>

			<description>One of the great things about having the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email service&lt;/a&gt; in place is that I'm hearing from friends who are now reading my blog, maybe for the first time. Anyway I heard from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon&quot;&gt;Chris Lydon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/03/07/scott-love-the.html&quot;&gt;Scott Love&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/08/144021.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's piece&lt;/a&gt; about the hero-making of big-dollar academic institutions for the reputational rehabilitation of billionaires. I've collaborated with both &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)&quot;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, on successful projects, decades apart. They know what can be accomplished with very little money. The money can buy you the illusion of creativity, the actual creativity is invisible to the eye, but is reflected in the product of the work. There's an inverse relationship often between appearances and what comes out the other end of the innovation assembly line.</description>

			<description>BTW, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/tarantinos-9th/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of Chris's podcast is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Hollywood&quot;&gt;Quentin Taratino's latest&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't listened to it yet, but I'm glad to discover that Chris is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino&quot;&gt;QT&lt;/a&gt; fan, as I am. It's perhaps similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Simpson&quot;&gt;Lisa Simpson&lt;/a&gt; being a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Itchy_%26_Scratchy_Show&quot;&gt;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&lt;/a&gt;. Why do nice people love violence in video so much? A mystery.</description>

			<description>Joi Ito is here to stay on the web. How do I know? Earlier today I was searching for a reference to my longtime friend Scott Love. Scott worked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt;, the outliner and presentations company I started in the 80s. He went on to write his own outliner. Joi used it. How do I know? Joi is a blogger. He wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/03/07/scott-love-the.html&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, the way bloggers do. He told you how he heard about it, what it was like talking with Scott, and what the product was like. His body of work is there and useful.</description>

			<description>If you find yourself having a strong emotional response to something you see on the net, take a step back and remember there's a good chance you're being programmed. You don't have to take the bait. And you shouldn't accept emotional appeals at face value.</description>

			<description>I'm starting to catch up on binge-watching. I saved the whole of season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt; to watch in a binge. It was good. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdZTGj3xag0&quot;&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/a&gt;, omg. I won't spoil it, but she plays a character from my neighborhood growing up. Something bad happened in her life, and we'll never know what role she played in it. The story is just as gripping as the previous season, and the acting superb. In other binges, I've started to work on season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;, just watched the first episode. I'm going to savor this show. One of the characters reminds me of Jason Calacanis for some reason. Just as the main character of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despicable_Me&quot;&gt;Despicable Me&lt;/a&gt;, Gru, reminds me of Mike Arrington, even though he looks nothing like him. But I digress. I still have to do something about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black&quot;&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;. I stopped watching toward the beginning of Season 5. I have no idea how to get back up to speed. Same with the third season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Counterpart&lt;/a&gt; -- both of which were very entertaining, but complex. Getting back up to speed in multi-season shows is hard. It might be a good idea to have a digest, maybe in written form, to help you get rebooted in these shows.</description>

			<title>The heroes machine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where are we left after Joi Ito &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/190907/p8#a190907p8&quot;&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; yesterday from positions at MIT, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/knightfdn/status/1170465388372594693&quot;&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/macfound/status/1170443088055144448&quot;&gt;MacArthur&lt;/a&gt; Foundations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NYTimesPR/status/1170461340768645120&quot;&gt;the NY Times&lt;/a&gt; and Harvard?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The scandal exposes how money is used by the very rich to help erase reputations they got as they got so rich.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's why I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/01.html#a115048&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; a week ago that the last thing I want to see is a Netflix series on the life of Bill Gates. I know the things he did to make his money. I didn't begrudge him his initial victory. He was tougher and smarter and took bigger risks than his competitors. He stared down IBM, when they deserted him, and won. That's a story that should be told, because winning there, the way he did, was heroic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What Gates did after he achieved dominance is where it was no longer a matter of skill and determination. It was the old layer of technology trying to prevent the new layer from booting up. As the web was growing, when the people behind it were academics with little funding and inexperienced Silicon Valley startups, he tried to kill it. And he didn't give up. It was Bill Gates vs the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The future needed our protection, but the press and government, and yes -- institutions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab&quot;&gt;MIT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brockman_(literary_agent)&quot;&gt;Brockman&lt;/a&gt; -- they feed off the vast fortunes people like Gates accumulate. To them it's their blood, they operate a huge PR machine and a vanity press for billionaires, and unless the ones that make the huge money need redemption to become saints, like latter-day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2013/08/01/207272849/how-andrew-carnegie-turned-his-fortune-into-a-library-legacy&quot;&gt;Carnegies&lt;/a&gt;, they won't get to be the heroes that reputation launderers like Negroponte and Joi Ito create.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is too dirty that their help can't be bought to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And what suffers?

			<description>Ultimately, imho -- the people who rise to the top of academic institutions are the ones who make donors feel good.

			<title>The motivation for persists</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Phil Windley, a developer friend from Utah, asks via email about the motivation for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/persists&quot;&gt;persists package&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was writing a bit of example code for another package I am working on. I iterated over it, factoring and simplifying until it was really easy to see what's going on. I pride myself on really easy to follow example code, because it's what I most need when I'm trying to figure out a new package, I figure it'll help others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to add a small feature that required a tiny bit of persistent data, a serialnum. Of course this comes up all the time, I have a standard practice for it. But in this example, the persistence code &lt;i&gt;doubled the size&lt;/i&gt; of the demo, and hid the elegance and simplicity of the code I was trying to demo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Frontier, of course, saving a scalar with persistence is simply a matter of assigning a value to it. The kernel takes care of everything else. All the years I've been working in JavaScript, I've been searching for that simplicity. The language is so hackable I figured there must be a way. And when they added the Proxy feature, it did become possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what persists is. It makes persistent values almost as simple as Frontier. The point is simplicity and factoring overhead from your mainline code into a package. And that's a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To really bring it home, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/examples/mailservice/mailservice.js&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt; I was talking about, after I used persists. And here are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/commit/38504e097ec2df29b2c242bac3d452ae23a808d2#diff-69efe25839c01bf1a31a1d98f9f793d9&quot;&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt;. And btw, I have an even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html&quot;&gt;simpler approach&lt;/a&gt;, but I can't do it unless I can change the JavaScript language spec, which probably isn't going to happen. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🙏&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you have questions about persists, this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/persists/issues/1&quot;&gt;good place&lt;/a&gt; to post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think I've got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/persists&quot;&gt;persists&lt;/a&gt; wrapped up pretty well. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/persists#readme&quot;&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/persists#a-simple-app&quot;&gt;simple app&lt;/a&gt;, and I walk through it explaining what it does. And a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/persists/blob/master/examples/lotsofobjects.js&quot;&gt;complex app&lt;/a&gt;. Finally solved the puzzle, how to get object database-like persistence using native JavaScript objects, using JavaScript object syntax. The key idea is that the objects are shared between the levels. One level takes care of persistence, the higher level keeps track of its data and doesn't care how it persists. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/15/0640.html&quot;&gt;pestering&lt;/a&gt; friends about this for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+persistent+javascript&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awbjs&quot;&gt;Allen WB&lt;/a&gt; said look at proxies.

			<description>It's remarkable how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614264/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joi-ito-nicholas-negroponte-funding-sex-abuse/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; the MIT Media Lab is in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/190905/p22#a190905p22&quot;&gt;obsession&lt;/a&gt; with money from billionaires. An organization at MIT focused on tech and media could do a lot of good, for very little money, by sending technologists into the world with a mission to create great open tech for the people. Instead the focus is on what percent of the world's billionaires you're on a first-name basis with, laundering their reputations by accepting their money. The work they do at the Media Lab is almost incidental. I understand why normal people feel so much disdain for the elite, because the dishonesty shines through, even if the details remain hidden.

			<description>The other day I wrote about an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; for persistent objects in JavaScript. It was dream of course because it requires a change in the language. So then I wanted to see how much of it you could implement with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy&quot;&gt;Proxy&lt;/a&gt; feature, which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/122&quot;&gt;explored&lt;/a&gt; with Ted Howard thirty days ago, and it turns out -- quite a bit!

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://deadspin.com/mets-ninth-inning-bullpen-implosion-special-even-by-met-1837857317?scrollnorefresh=1&quot;&gt;The Mets lost&lt;/a&gt; last night in an unbelievable way. I watched most of the game, switching back and forth between it and MSNBC. I started to go to bed after the Mets batted in the ninth, I thought for sure the game was over, merely a formality to get the last three batters out. The Mets &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/mlb/game?gameId=401076805&quot;&gt;were ahead&lt;/a&gt; 10-4. The home team, the Nationals were defeated, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/04/turner.png&quot;&gt;humiliatingly stupid way&lt;/a&gt;, not just hitting, ptiching and base-running. Well by the time I got upstairs, with the game on my iPhone, I couldn't believe the score. Runners on second and third, tying run at the plate, one out. I thought well either they win or lose, I'm going to wash up, take my vitamins, brush my teeth, etc. Just as I was grabbing the toothbrush, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/video/edwin-diaz-in-play-run-s-to-kurt-suzuki&quot;&gt;walk-off home run&lt;/a&gt;. I decided then and there that this was the end of the Mets season. It was a nice run, August was great, but there's no way a team comes back from this. Not even the Mets.</description>

Of course the moment passed, I'm glad I didn't say anything because everyone should be able to stop in at the pharmacy without meeting strangers who feel they already know them.</description>

			<title>Persist -- a new data behavior?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jS/js_let.asp&quot;&gt;const, var and let&lt;/a&gt; which control how things are stored. Every language has these. Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, I got used to having persistent data storage. If I created something in the object database, the kernel took care of persisting it. I could just use it like memory that was always there, and didn't have to worry about saving it to files. I find all the time I wish that JavaScript had this. I think I may have finally figured out how that might work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1168981114083598336&quot;&gt;the idea&lt;/a&gt;. A new storage attribute called persist. It can only apply to global objects. You could write this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;persist serialnum = 0;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then you could do normal operations on it like:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;serialnum++;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next time the app runs it already has a value. Unlike with &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;const&lt;/i&gt; the initialization code only runs when there is no &lt;i&gt;persist&lt;/i&gt; object named serialnum (i.e. the first time the app runs with this value declared).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to implement this in the language interpreter. It might even be possible with proxies. I don't understand them well enough yet to know. I also think you could do it with somewhat less elegant code using an NPM package.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Matt Terrenzio &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mterenzio/status/1169244024223481856&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Persist where?&quot; My response: Somewhere. Anywhere really. Probably in a file on the local hard drive, stored in JSON. It could be in a database or in the cloud. It should be something that the developer can override, and it should default to something simple. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>More and more I use Twitter to write the first drafts of posts that I then write more fully &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/03.html#a142736&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. It really is becoming the context for my blogging, a very different role from what it played a few years ago. The 280-char limit is a very important change, but I think other things matter too. People are taking Twitter more seriously? Each of us sees &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant&quot;&gt;something different&lt;/a&gt; of course.</description>

			<description>Going forward with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;XML-RPC in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; project. I realized I &lt;s&gt;should&lt;/s&gt; must include an HTTP server in the package. It's nice that you can use the protocol over any transport, and use JSON in place of XML, but there is a standard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html&quot;&gt;RPC over XML via HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. So this is what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/43fc83d0cbfe811dcac284fa3890f291&quot;&gt;typical server&lt;/a&gt; looks like with those assumptions. Much simpler than it would otherwise be, which of course is the point of using XML-RPC. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😁&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Yet as they say I never heard about him from reading the news. I think basically he doesn't get reported because news people read only each other, and they aren't writing about him. It's a closed loop. I don't think they mean him harm, it's just their network has a bug. He's definitely worth listening to and learning from. He has good ideas. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Yet as they say I never heard about him from reading the news. I think basically he doesn't get reported because news people read only each other, and they aren't writing about him. It's a closed loop. I don't think they mean him harm, it's just their network has a bug. He's definitely worth listening to and learning from. He has good ideas. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 03 Sep 2019 14:14:58 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/02/mrFrog.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/09/03.html#a141458"/>

			<title>How the NY Times came to support RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: I posted this &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/02/09/how-the-ny-times-came-to-support-rss/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on a wordpress.com site in 2006, but it should be part of the scripting.com archive. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The history of RSS is usually told only in one dimension, it’s the story of geeks fighting with geeks, so they say, but in my humble opinion, that’s really not the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the vocal people on the mail lists, blogs and wikis are more fans than creators. It’s as if we confused baseball players with people who sit in the stands watching a baseball game. Sure, both wear caps and want their team to win, but one actually does something about it, while the others expresses an opinion. There are a lot of fans, but relatively few people who actually do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mike Lopez, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/#comment-1302&quot;&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on this blog yesterday recalls a story he heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195825&quot;&gt;on NPR&lt;/a&gt; about basketball great Wilt Chamberlain and his relationship with fans. Chamberlain’s philosophy: it’s easier to humor them than to argue with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Analogously, in the age of Wikipedia, fans can give themselves credit not just for being there when Wilt had his amazing 100 point game, but they can actually claim to have had the 100 point game themselves. Welcome to the Internet. Community participation is both its strongest and weakest point. And those who say I’m a consistent supporter of the medium miss that I am as frequently its victim. Sadly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NY Times is not a sideline player in the history of RSS, as I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/20/rss-came-from-the-publishing-industry-2/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, they played a central role, first denying us permission to use their content, then allowing it, and in doing so, providing an example for the rest of the publishing industry, which followed their lead without undermining them, without reinventing the technology, to their credit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was on this day &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/02/09.html&quot;&gt;in 2001&lt;/a&gt; that I received a call from a “Rights and Contracts manager” at the New York Times, she asked us to stop reading their XML newsfeeds. I complied with the request. A colleague who will remain nameless had snuck me a link to an unprotected directory where the feeds, in a proprietary XML-based format, resided. I then repurposed the information and published it on a UserLand server. Truth be told, I expected to be shut down, but in doing so, I also expected to get the attention of higher-ups at the Times (who I knew read my blog) and it surely did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then early in 2002, I had a dinner with Martin Nisenholtz and Times board member Dave Liddle and two San Francisco-based Times reporters, where I pitched them on two things: 1. Publish in RSS, and 2. Give blogs to every Times reporter. They took me up on #1 and in April we published the Times content, but not in RSS (although we were permitted to by our contract), instead using the Times’s proprietary format. Why did we do that? Well I figured that if we pubished in RSS 0.92, which was then our most advanced format, it would drag the Times into a format war and they might think it’s not worth the trouble and ask us to stop publishing their content. So I decided to ease them into the community, first publishing invisibly to the people on the mail lists, and then, once their presence was cemented, we switched over to RSS 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the loud and obnoxious fans on the mail lists shaped the story, a little. Instead of confronting their loudness, we side-stepped it. Now the Times may or may not be seen as the “tipping point” more widely, but I see it that way. Without the Times, we would have remained in disagreement, stuck in mail list hell, never achieving the promise of the technology. We all owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude, and should learn the lesson well, don’t look for leadership in standards to the netizens or to Silicon Valley, look to users who have a stake in making the technology work. Imho, that’s the key to getting things to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
