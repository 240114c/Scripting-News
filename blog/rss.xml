			<title>It helps to know something</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR -- everyone in tech could benefit from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science&quot;&gt;semester&lt;/a&gt; of Computer Science, to help them understand how the products are created. Just like someone in the auto industry should know a bit about how cars work, or in the wine industry how grapes are farmed and turned into wine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was just telling a story to Kevin Tofel over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KevinCTofel/posts/10157548873102082&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; about my first experiences dealing with analysts in the tech industry in the 80s. Kevin is a journalist and a consultant for tech companies. He plays a similar role to the early analysts, in today's context. He's taking Computer Science classes. I've been following along, remembering when the concepts he's learning now were fresh for me. It was a great time of discovery, I love how computers work, then and now -- and it's gratifying, in a way, that they still teach the same basic data structures. I guess they never change? I like that. Linked lists, balanced trees, hash tables and the like. I hope they have him build a compiler, that was the last mystery for me. Once I understood that there's no magic to it, I was ready to learn everything about computers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it amazed me when I was starting out in tech that the expensive analysts had never taken a class in computer science. Didn't understand the basic components of a computer. I wasn't sure how to talk to them. I wanted someone to understand how our outliners worked, and how we had tried two internal models before finding a third that had the good qualities of both and none of the bad. I thought one of the analysts should understand how the increasing capabilities of PCs made these decisions easier, and how we were planning future products based on further expected improvements. When you come down to it, the algorithms Kevin is learning now were important performance considerations for the software we were making, especially in the 80s when computers weren't as capable as they are today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I sold out to a medium-size tech company and they did their strategic planning by inviting one of the analysts in, asking what they should do, and then doing what they said. It was as if you ran a $100 million software company by asking Norm what products you should make. (Norm is Kevin's dog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMMhZu6-zCM9bc-4Tc6AJP46Hx1tiS-A9BEHNUfFy0YQsp8tlynNOauUt_dy8VVVA?key=RTlfWVQ0T21IbTVnZE9laGMtak55dWR4cVdNV01R&quot;&gt;cute&lt;/a&gt; and opinionated, but not too knowledgable about the economics of software.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I learned is this -- you have to relate to the analysts based on feelings. They have to feel as if you know what you're doing and then they'll echo what you say in your press releases to reporters looking for a quote. Another way to get them on your side was to pay them, by subscribing to the newsletters ($495 per year) and going to their conferences (another $2K per), and if you really were rich you could buy their consulting services (I suppose that the company I sold out to did). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What was interesting/funny is that they sometimes found the trends that mattered even though there's no earthly reason they should have. Maybe they tapped into some thread of knowledge that I didn't. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Enclosed here as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/04/audioResponseToATweet.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. It's so twisted. But listen to it, I think you'll find there's a loop in how news deals with tech. It would be better if we could break out of the loop of course.</description>

			<description>A guest on Ari Melber last night (I think it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamalSimmons&quot;&gt;Jamal Simmons&lt;/a&gt;) said what I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/05/21.html&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; about the 2020 election. It'll probably be a Russian style election where the incumbent gets 98% of the vote. We can't afford to wait for that. Think about all the other crazy stuff the incumbent is doing, that we can see, and then the stuff that is being covered up. Depending on the election only makes sense as a distant Plan B. I think even most Republicans would see that at this time.</description>

			<description>I'd like to see Melo and Jeremy Lin join up and become friends, work out, and reinvent basketball, and then approach the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; team. They're smart, still-talented players. I think the stink on both of the comes from the crazy missed opportunity of the Linsanity period.</description>

			<title>Mailchimp testing results</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yudel&quot;&gt;Larry Yudelson&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime reader of this blog has a commercial Mailchimp account and offered to let me use it to test nightly emails for the blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I get one test per day. Reminds me of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card&quot;&gt;punched cards&lt;/a&gt; days of mainframes, only worse. Turnaround generally was less than an hour back then. It's okay though, I find it somewhat relaxing to consider Mailchimp only once per day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://us2.campaign-archive.com/?e=9b37eab71e&amp;u=872b6dc1474d8545c737dfc44&amp;id=89c814d14c&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the email for yesterday's blog posts.  I'm not sure how long that link will work, so here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/post.zip&quot;&gt;archived copy&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/emailtop.png&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of screen &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/emailbottom.png&quot;&gt;shots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few notes follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have been able to fix a bunch of the problems &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/scriptingnightlyrss/email.css&quot;&gt;using CSS&lt;/a&gt;. But some I can't fix because they put the styles inline. No way to override those as far as I know. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I could I'd get rid of the top two items. They repeat info included elsewhere. They're the kind of noise people rightly skip over. I like to take that kind of noise out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They chose a really ugly color for links, and hard-code the font for headlines.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's funny however that some of my overrides work when I view the email &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/correctRendering.png&quot;&gt;in the browser&lt;/a&gt;, vs &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/wrongRendering.png&quot;&gt;in GMail&lt;/a&gt;. In GMail their styles dominate. In the browser, mine do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The way my email address appears in the &lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; line abuses the &amp;lt;author&gt; element in &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. If I wanted it to link to an HTML page about me, instead of providing my email address (a real mistake), I would have to break the &amp;lt;author&gt; element. That's fucked up. They should have a namespace that calls for exactly what they want and not force people to break RSS to get a good result. Interop isn't any use if people don't respect it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I can't make it perfect, but I can make it okay. I'm thinking of trying another service that has an API and see if I can make it perform better. They do call this blog &lt;i&gt;Scripting&lt;/i&gt; News after all. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/02/listeningToUsers.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about journalism and listening to users, based on a ridiculous Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1156925544421908482&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about journalism and listening in which of course the journalists didn't listen. Imho that's why our political system is so out of whack. The public is never heard, their perspective is never represented, and we are never allowed to interject our two cents. I only shared it with Ken Smith, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://clas.iusb.edu/english/faculty/smith.html&quot;&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; friend from Indiana. He says he was nodding in agreement through the whole thing. Okay, considering that, I decided I should publish it. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. If you're a journalist you probably won't but you should listen anyway. No pain no gain, as they say.</description>

			<description>I don't think the NBA works &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/8/1/20749687/carmelo-anthony-comeback-nba&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;, though emotionally I would hate to see Melo's career end now. Same with Jeremy Lin. I think Melo being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/02/meloLin.png&quot;&gt;stinker&lt;/a&gt; put Lin and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D%27Antoni&quot;&gt;D'Antonio&lt;/a&gt; on the road. I'd like to see Melo apologize to Lin, and make a condition of his restitution that his buddy JL has to be included in the deal. Both role players. Melo a bench forward, Lin a bench guard. They work out together and make something new out of their respective talents.</description>

			<description>It'd be interesting to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;BloggerCon-style&lt;/a&gt; mini-conference on grounds for impeaching Trump, with a note-taker, organizing the ideas into an outline in real-time. I see so many ideas, ones that would force Repubs in the House and Senate to vote against Mom and apple pie. One random idea you never hear in the news -- how about impeaching him for hate crimes, inciting violence against blacks, to begin with. Never mind that it would be a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_out_the_vote&quot;&gt;GOTV&lt;/a&gt; tactic, and also for fund-raising, it would force Repubs to admit they are Nazis. The sooner they decloak, imho, the better. (BTW, I don't think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/moscow-mitch-mcconnell.html&quot;&gt;Moscow Mitch&lt;/a&gt; can table impeachment. The Senate has to actually vote. Key point people overlook.)</description>
