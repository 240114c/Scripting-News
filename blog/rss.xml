			<description>I'm doing an interesting project, reviewing all the top-level pages on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; spec, checking every link to see if it's broken. For those that are, I try to come up with a suitable replacement, usually the archive.org snapshot taken around the time the page was written. If it isn't broken I don't do anything. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/rss2specbrokenlinks.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; with all the links I've found. Most of the external links are gone, but there are some surprises, sites that have been well-preserved, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000967.html&quot;&gt;Jeremy Zawodny's&lt;/a&gt;. I just came across a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://static.userland.com/gems/backend/gratefulDead.xml&quot;&gt;first podcast feed&lt;/a&gt;, it's still there. I'm not sure how, but it is. This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration&quot;&gt;restoration&lt;/a&gt; project, started because there was breakage caused by the move to HTTPS on the server. That breakage has been fixed. I also changed the line-endings from carriage-return to linefeed, which now is the almost-universal standard. At the time, 2003, it was still kind of muddy. As a result you can now read the source of the pages in a current browser. The site is a relic. It's a good idea to fix the broken links every 15 years or so. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'll probably continue to post notes here as I go along. There were two crucial broken links on the home page of the spec: 1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc822.html&quot;&gt;RFC 822&lt;/a&gt;, and 2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thetwowayweb.com/payloadsforrss&quot;&gt;Payloads for RSS&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are integral to the format. I tried to find a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt&quot;&gt;solid link&lt;/a&gt; to the RFC that would stand the test of time. And I discovered that I had copied the Payloads doc, which was originally on a domain that I let go, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/payloadsForRss.html&quot;&gt;the RSS site&lt;/a&gt;. So I'm going to use that link, instead of an archive.org link.</description>

			<description>This project gives an idea of how important archive.org is going to be to web restorations. Their snapshots are invaluable. Most sites are very temporary things. A great example, I did a project with Jim Moore and Nicco Mele at the Dean campaign in January 2004, an aggregate of a lot of the Dean blogs in RSS format. The Dean campaign was a seminal event in the bootstrap of political blogging. Dean was the first &quot;Web Candidate,&quot; certainly not the last. All the websites that the Dean people started are gone today, including the project I did with them, but they're all there on archive.org, so I was able to do a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/howChannelDeanCameToBe.html&quot;&gt;decent restoration&lt;/a&gt; of that project. (Note the updated links are not present on the site yet.)</description>

			<description>Impeach Trump for violating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_of_Nobility_Clause&quot;&gt;Emoluments Clause&lt;/a&gt;. He's obviously doing it. Nothing could be clearing grounds for impeachment than violating the Constitution. It's hardly a technicality. Simple to prove. An Congress doesn't need a court to approve its standing.</description>

			<description>I was 14 years old in 1969, at summer camp, on a trip to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.setlist.fm/festival/1969/newport-folk-festival-1969-13d6e58d.html&quot;&gt;Newport Folk Festival&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11&quot;&gt;moon landing&lt;/a&gt; happened. I remember being part of a huge group of people huddled in front of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2&quot;&gt;VW minibus&lt;/a&gt; with a small &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;biw=1133&amp;bih=940&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=BnszXfjjGaSq_QaLmLegDQ&amp;q=portable+b%26w+tv+sixties&amp;oq=portable+b%26w+tv+sixties&amp;gs_l=img.3...12523.13721..14115...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz-img.0H8gj3AGQbY&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4_tq_rMTjAhUkVd8KHQvMDdQQ4dUDCAY&amp;uact=5&quot;&gt;B&amp;W TV&lt;/a&gt; on top, and somehow we all saw the landing.

We ought to pick the most boring and coherent presidential candidate -- the most plain and uncontroversial person on the stage. Nominate him or her, and then get ready to fight. I agree with Friedman, the things they agreed to in the debate were &lt;i&gt;insane. &lt;/i&gt;They handed the election to Trump. We need to grab it back.

Trump is funny. He's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caricature&quot;&gt;caricature&lt;/a&gt;, a funny &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqyQfjDScjU&quot;&gt;impersonation&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini&quot;&gt;strong man&lt;/a&gt;. People who love him think he's hilarious. Entertaining. I've been saying &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/20/1203.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/28/1224.html&quot;&gt;since&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/09/0815.html&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to counter-program the rallies, which the Democrats, if they had an ounce of ambition, would have done from the start, what you need are old-style standup comedians. Unfortunately the good ones are dead. Joan Rivers (who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN2C6ctpOhg&quot;&gt;liked&lt;/a&gt; Trump, she was a real &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-5Q7yuaXjM&quot;&gt;asshole&lt;/a&gt;, she didn't just play one on TV) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qofdWFv7m0U&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MecU2keW54I&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLODGhEyLvk&quot;&gt;George Carlin&lt;/a&gt;. But there must be others. Get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH_-9hD2xBY&quot;&gt;Bill Hader&lt;/a&gt; to do a Joan Rivers impersonation. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glamour.com/story/kate-mckinnon-best-celebrity-impressions-on-saturday-night-live&quot;&gt;Kate McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can leave the &lt;a href=&quot;https://elizabethwarren.com/&quot;&gt;Democratic nominee&lt;/a&gt; to talk about health care, securing the borders, the basic values of America. Let Trump compete with the comedians, which is appropriate because that's what he is.</description>

I've been saying &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/20/1203.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/28/1224.html&quot;&gt;since&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/09/0815.html&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to counter-program the rallies, which the Democrats, if they had an ounce of ambition, would have done from the start, what you need are old-style standup comedians. Unfortunately the good ones are dead. Joan Rivers (who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN2C6ctpOhg&quot;&gt;liked&lt;/a&gt; Trump, she was a real &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-5Q7yuaXjM&quot;&gt;asshole&lt;/a&gt;, she didn't just play one on TV) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qofdWFv7m0U&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MecU2keW54I&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLODGhEyLvk&quot;&gt;George Carlin&lt;/a&gt;. But there must be others. Get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH_-9hD2xBY&quot;&gt;Bill Hader&lt;/a&gt; to do a Joan Rivers impersonation. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glamour.com/story/kate-mckinnon-best-celebrity-impressions-on-saturday-night-live&quot;&gt;Kate McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can leave the &lt;a href=&quot;https://elizabethwarren.com/&quot;&gt;Democratic nominee&lt;/a&gt; to talk about health care, securing the borders, the basic values of America. Let Trump compete with the comedians, which is appropriate because that's what he is." created="Thu, 18 Jul 2019 12:42:30 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/07/18/greatDictator.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/07/18.html#a124230"/>

			<description>I am having an allergic reaction to the idea that those monsters at Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article232776672.html&quot;&gt;rallies&lt;/a&gt; are Americans. I desperately want to join with others to say that the America I was born in doesn't belong to any one race or religion. I think every few generations we have to renew this very basic idea, that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum&quot;&gt;union&lt;/a&gt;, out of many, one.</description>

			<description>I've had contractors and workers coming through my house this week, lots of them. Where I live there's no cell service, so the ones who had smart phones could hook through my wifi. But a few of them didn't have phones and many of the rest, esp ones over 40, couldn't set up a new wifi access point. (I set it up for them.) Can you imagine doing a job that requires you to be away from the office most of every day without the ability to communicate? A reminder that not everyone is on the net, even in the US, in 2019.</description>

			<title>Manhattan blackouts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of NYC blackouts, there was a blackout in Manhattan, below 23rd St, in the weeks &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/threads/november2012.html#noMarathon&quot;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; Hurricane Sandy. I was living in the 50s at the time, so was unaffected. We never lost power. I walked downtown to see what it was like. It felt post-apocalyptic, like visiting New Orleans after Katrina. The weirdest thing was walking north on Broadway in the dark, and seeing Times Square in the distance, fully lit. How like New York, I thought. It's a place of business first. The show must go on. But how would it feel to be living in the blacked-out part realizing that a few blocks to the north, life was going on, as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>With all the progress being made in machine learning it's a wonder that the quality of phone calls is so bad. My brain can do the filtering to compensate for weak signals and even interpolate short outages. But it's a strain. Isn't this something software can help us with??</description>

			<description>In 1995 I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Software is a process, it's never finished, it's always evolving. That's its nature. We know our software sucks. But it's shipping! Next time we'll do better, but even then it will be shitty. The only software that's perfect is one you're dreaming about. Real software crashes, loses data, is hard to learn and hard to use. But it's a process. We'll make it less shitty. Just watch!&quot; So it occurred to me that the Beatles song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGlo9LzmOME&quot;&gt;Getting Better&lt;/a&gt; would be a great song to teach computer science students. Sing it before every class. &quot;Getting so much better all the time.&quot;</description>

			<description>My home heating system needs work, so I went to the website for the heating guy, and had a choice of contacting them by phone or through a web form. I went with the form. I was impressed with how well-designed it was, except it required an &quot;evening phone&quot; which is the same as my day phone, i.e. my iPhone. Probably shouldn't even ask for two phones these days, it's kind of an obsolete concept. Anyway, my gripe is this. After carefully composing the message, I spaced out on copying it to the clipboard, a time-honored defense against buggy software, it just cleared the form after I clicked the Send button, which was a WTF moment for me. Much better would be to confirm that the mail was sent, both on-screen and via an email. Now I'm in a place where I don't know if the email was sent, certainly don't want to re-write the message, and in case the other one &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; sent, it'll look like I'm crazy for sending the same message twice, but with different words. Show empathy for the user, and confirm so they can relax.</description>

			<description>Taco Bell is doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.sfgate.com/food/article/Pacifica-taco-bell-cantina-alcohol-menu-opening-14082626.php?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=referral&quot;&gt;innovative marketing&lt;/a&gt;, not selling -- trying to nudge its brand upscale, and for me, it works. It's surprising, I always thought of TB as cheap fast food. I liked their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8sZ1DWsAHE&quot;&gt;ads&lt;/a&gt;. Two tacos for 99 cents. But this new approach is more effective imho than just advertising.</description>

			<title>Kurt Vonnegut was right</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I came up with a title for my book of memories on my bike ride. I found a simple idea that ties all my observations together. It goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kurt Vonnegut was right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. If you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan&quot;&gt;Sirens of Titan&lt;/a&gt; you'll know what I mean. The ending. And pretty much every other book he wrote, all were so funny because the truth is funny, that is if you believe what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut&quot;&gt;Vonnegut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut#Works&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; which I do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A media hack is different from a software hack. Podcasting is a media hack. Sure, there was a little software needed to get the bootstrap going. But the innovation was the combination of HTTP, MP3 and RSS. It's like a S'more, which is a &quot;cookie hack.&quot;</description>

			<description>As a paying user of Dropbox who uses the web interface rarely, when I need to restore a file that's damaged, I don't appreciate them trying to make Dropbox into a lot more than it is, and thus making it hard to quickly find what I need to get my server back online.</description>

			<title>Twittertube&amp;trade;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I ran Twitter, I'd create a developer toolkit for creating setups like screen2.io. You'd specify a YouTube video. The chat part of the interface would just be Twitter, so your Twitter followers would read what you're saying (or not, it would be a preference). Now I'd have a way to watch live video feeds from YouTube in Twitter. And of course the &quot;developers&quot; wouldn't be super techie devs. They would be people who are good discussion leaders, and people who are good at keeping spammers out. You could share revenue with them to make it really grow. You could call it twittertube. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism and jury duty. I agreed strongly with what Emily Bell said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilybell/status/1148298094146129921&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Jury duty is a powerful idea, and it works. It's the basis for our justice system. I've written about jury duty many times, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/08/whyShouldYouJoinAJury.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/whatILearnedFromJuryDuty&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/29/juryDutyDay2.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/03/01/juryduty.html&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Observation. If you're going to use a CDN that doesn't let you overlay your own domain name, and your code is coming from an S3 bucket, it's much easier to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com&quot;&gt;s3.amazonaws.com&lt;/a&gt; and no less independent of another entity. I imagine this is okay with Amazon because it's lock-in. But this is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/code/nbariver/index.html&quot;&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; that works over HTTPS, the URL Is uglier than shit, but it works. It's an important milestone because my users have legit reasons to want to make rivers accessible via HTTPS.</description>

			<description>Ever notice that mostly what people post on Twitter is designed to get attention for the author. I think that's due to the award incentive of the system. Flow == more followers == power and prestige. I wonder if there's a way to reward people based on the depth and originality of ideas they post, or RT. Zero points for repeating a talking point from a random hack on Meet The Press. Huge points for an idea that makes people want to consume less.</description>

			<title>Self-sovereign howto?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if anyone has written a *simple* developer flow for self sovereign identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Use-case: I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt;. I currently use Twitter for identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Could self-sovereign be plugged in as a replacement for Twitter&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Would it be more or less complicated for developer?

			<description>I gave $100 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marianne2020.com/&quot;&gt;Marianne Williamson&lt;/a&gt; for president. She has a message that's totally worth listening to. We love America. We're not scared of the world, we lead the world. If we want a place in America for everyone, we need an expansive view of who we are and what our abilities.</description>

			<description>I gave up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/07/05.html#a211151&quot;&gt;Designated Survivor&lt;/a&gt;, I even tried skipping ahead to the third (Netflix) season, where they say the f-word and there are naked butts, but it's just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;House of Cards&lt;/a&gt;, idiotic. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://torontolife.com/culture/movies-and-tv/how-designated-survivor-built-a-replica-oval-office-in-toronto/&quot;&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; for the Oval Office is much better. After looking through HBO, I landed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affair_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Affair&lt;/a&gt; on Showtime. Finally something with an adult plot, and HBO style. One of the stars is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_West&quot;&gt;McNulty&lt;/a&gt; from The WIre and his asshole &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doman&quot;&gt;father-in-law&lt;/a&gt; is the police chief who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rawls&quot;&gt;tormented&lt;/a&gt; McNulty. And the sex is not gratuitous, it's the plot. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk,_New_York&quot;&gt;Montauk&lt;/a&gt; is very photogenic as is McNulty's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Wilson&quot;&gt;lover&lt;/a&gt;. It got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-affair&quot;&gt;high ratings&lt;/a&gt;, I'm in episode 3 of season one and there are four seasons, so I'm hopeful.</description>

			<description>Idea. They should only play the national anthem at the end of a match, and only the anthem of the winning country. That way they have something of honor to play for, and we only have to listen to one anthem.</description>

			<description>Interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2019/07/05/feature/haunted-by-the-reagan-era/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; says the current Democratic leadership is haunted by Reagan. Here's what I think happened. Nixon. Watergate. The country needed to cleanse itself so it elected a Mr Rogers type, Jimmy Carter, who we knew for sure wouldn't do the nasty stuff Nixon was doing. He came into DC thinking he could change things, instead DC ignored him, and everyone could see it/feel it, and then the hostage crisis, the failed rescue, America was mostly over Nixon and we wanted to kick ass and Reagan came along and said Let's Kick Ass and people looked at Carter, talking about a great national malaise, and there were gas lines, and the world was pushing us around so we said Fuck yeah. So the Repubs found something that worked, and the Dems never caught on. So maybe AOC et al are right, the Repubs are buffoons and criminals, and everyone knows it, including most voters, so what a Democrat has to do is say we kick ass, but we're a team and we have to work together. I don't know, it could work. I think the most convincing character running for president is Jay Inslee, believe or not. And if we could get Gavin Newsom to run, he's the closest we have to a Democratic Reagan.</description>
