			<description>I am listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdEQkRq_xrw&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; a lot these days. &quot;Burn down the mission If we're gonna stay alive. Watch the black smoke fly to heaven. See the red flame light the sky.&quot; A theme song for this era. We're going to have to burn it down. We've been putting it off for too long and now are living with the consequences. That's why this hurts so much, we created this moment as much as the Tea Party people did.</description>

			<description>It took about a half hour to realize the thermometer I got in the mail today was not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvs.com/shop/kinsa-quickcare-smart-digital-thermometer-for-all-ages-prodid-2180122&quot;&gt;Kinsa thermometer&lt;/a&gt; and that's why I couldn't configure the Kinsa app to talk to it. D'oh. God is goofing on me today. I ordered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085Y6H3CZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;thermometer&lt;/a&gt; in March as a test to see if the world would still be here in May. Haha joke's on me, it is. PS: It got here a month early.</description>

			<description>I have mixed feelings about our demonstrations for health care workers. It could be interpreted not so much as appreciation as &quot;please save us.&quot;  The health care worker might resent this. I would. Why couldn't you heed the warning sooner? But it's good because it's a reminder to ourselves that there will be no simplistic solution to this problem. The applause is for us, for having the resolve and discipline to stick with it. And knowing no matter how painful it is for us, we have it easy.</description>

			<description>There's a myth that every dollar the government spends is from taxes, i.e. &lt;i&gt;taxpayer money. &lt;/i&gt;Far from it, It's at least partially invented money or borrowed money, esp when it comes to bailouts and pointless wars. It's all good when the money is invested in a positive way, that creates growth, or value for the citizens of the country, now and especially future. Education is one great example, health care, and esp public health (as we're learning now). When we burn the money by blowing up far-away countries, or give the money to big companies for no reason, or the super-rich, it does nothing for us, or really for them. It's like scattering the money to the wind.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.this.how/davewiner/howtos.opml&quot;&gt;new service&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; users. Use this kind of outline for documents you want to add to or refine over time. FAQs, guidelines, instructions, screeds. Definitely not for blog posts, since there's no time element in it. There's lots of depth to this kind of outline, and it's easy for me to add new features. So that's an extra bonus. If a small community of writers develops here, I will have incentive to show you how to use the other features, and perhaps add new ones.</description>

			<description>I chose this route for rolling out rendering for outlines very deliberately because it &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; include blogging features. It's focused on writing. There are already countless ways to blog. But there's a common feature set between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/&quot;&gt;this.how&lt;/a&gt; docs and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;Old School blogs&lt;/a&gt;, so any skills you pick up here can work for blogs too, if there's ever a need to go that far. I have found this format useful even though I have a blog. So when you think -- I should write some guidelines for this, or a FAQ or directions for cooking a type of bread, writing that isn't of-the-moment, then you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; to write and revise it, and send people the URL of the my.this.how rendering of it.</description>

			<description>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/164&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; about Apple podcasts. The new &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; podcast shows up in my iPhone podcasts app. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/10/cuomoScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. It also shows as having updated. But when I look at the page for the podcast it only shows episodes through Tuesday. Today is Friday. Is there something wrong with my feed? I want to get this working properly. I also noted that Sunday and Monday are missing too. They are most definitely in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Testing and contact tracing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Testing and contact tracing is central to turning the lights back on before there's a Covid19 vaccine. Since the US government isn't doing it, we have to do it. We can't afford to wait. Lives and livelihoods are at stake. Too important.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Testing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Testing is doable. Since the FDA is a bottleneck maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-09/california-declares-independence-from-trump-s-coronavirus-plans&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Masachusetts and any other state who cares about its people can break free, or work with the US government's FDA to loosen things up so we can get say 10 million tests done per day for the forseeable future. You should be able to get one whenever you want one.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I heard on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer Show&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/how-testing-will-help-us-get-back-regular-life/&quot;&gt;morning&lt;/a&gt; that the testing part apparently is doable, we can scale it up. It'll cost $100 billion to start, but if it got us out of this mess a month sooner it would be a good investment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact tracing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/10/831200054/cdc-director-very-aggressive-contact-tracing-needed-for-u-s-to-return-to-normal&quot;&gt;Contact tracing&lt;/a&gt; is easily solved, very quickly. It's more of a political problem than a technological one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://privatekit.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT has an app&lt;/a&gt; for contact tracing. It has the right privacy configuration, the information isn't shared without you sending the data somewhere. By default it never leaves your phone. But the MIT app is on very few phones. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Apple and Google and others have &lt;i&gt;very good&lt;/i&gt; data for contact tracing and their apps are widely deployed. World-wide. We wouldn't just be solving the problem for the US, we'd be doing it for everyone everywhere who has an iPhone or Android phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they are reluctant to even say they can do it for fear of the backlash. It's time to have this conversation. Maybe the surveillance aspect of the new technology is worth supporting if it saves lives and can easily be turned off, by the user, when we're no longer in crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt; is the expert on this. I'll ask him what he thinks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after this piece was posted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology&quot;&gt;Apple and Google announced&lt;/a&gt; they're going to work together on contact tracing. Wow. That's quick turnaround! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I remember how hard it was to stop smoking in the years before I actually did. I would make a little progress, and feel okay I can have one now, I've been good, and then I go right back to two packs a day. Getting rid of the virus is going to be like that. Just when we feel like we have it licked is when you have to double-down on the commitment. It's so easy to let up, relax. And go back to the thing that was killing you.</description>

A non-smoking story at the Bowie concert last week. As I'm walking out I see people lighting up everywhere. Smell of smoke all around. It smells good. I really want one. In my mind I outline the steps it would take to be smoking and the amount of time it would take. I would ask someone if they could spare a cigarette. If they said no I'd offer them $1. Oh hell, just offer $1 to begin with. Whoo, where would I get a match. I'd ask for a light. Take a drag. Estimated time, 15 seconds to one minute to first nicotine rush. My heart started beating faster. I felt scared like you feel on a NY subway platform as a train is entering the station and you're standing on the platform and in the instant before it passes you think how you could end your life by leaning forward.&quot;</description>

			<description>A couple of months ago it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/08.html#a184531&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to bug me that I didn't have a DVR for my TV, haven't had one since I gave up my TiVO when I left Massachusetts in 2004. Now my cable setup is Spectrum, because that's the only cable supplier where I live, and their TV package, including HBO, Showtime, and the rest of the stuff. I used it mainly for HBO, MSNBC, Law &amp; Order and the occasional Knicks game. I set out on a quest for an alternative, and the best I came up with is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; which I am now subscribed to. The other choice was Hulu, which I have used and liked. Not sure which is better. Anyway, I got my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder&quot;&gt;DVR&lt;/a&gt;, so I can watch last night's Maddow when &lt;i&gt;The Trump Show&lt;/i&gt; is on in the early evening. And I don't need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insider.com/when-sports-return-from-coronavirus-hiatus-nba-mlb-nhl-2020-3&quot;&gt;sports&lt;/a&gt;, because there aren't any. And I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://channelstore.roku.com/details/8378/hbo-go&quot;&gt;HBO app&lt;/a&gt;, along with Netflix and Amazon. It's a good setup.</description>

			<title>Biden can make a difference now</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Biden can assemble a panel of scientists and medical doctors to keep the public informed. An hour a day, press conference style. What the CDC would be doing if Trump weren't president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And he (Biden) would step back, an example for what Trump should do. Let the doctors and the military manage it. Stop campaigning while thousands of Americans are dying. Biden wouldn't even have to say it. It would make Trump look immediately tone deaf which he most certainly is.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea so appealing right now is that the governors are linking up and sharing resources. Someone should be providing the science for them. The government is failing. But there's plenty of unused talent out there, it just needs to be managed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another reason -- it would mean that in order to compete, Trump would not only have to enable his scientists, he would also have to start using the US government money as it must be used, not for whatever bullshit he has planned. If he doesn't why should anyone listen to him? By giving him TV power the networks have made it unnecessary for him to use the government's economic and military power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When I sit down at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1115239756974174208&quot;&gt;lovely dinner&lt;/a&gt;, with interesting, humor-filled friends in a beautiful spot, I am as rich as I can possibly be. A billionaire couldn't have more. I first realized this at a sushi restaurant in Sausalito, where the chef had prepared the most amazing looking and tasting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1115618047757254656&quot;&gt;bouquet&lt;/a&gt; of fresh fish and rice.

			<description>I'd like to see one of the cable channels continue their regular broadcast without airing The Trump Show every night. It's very bad for our country, in the spirit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE&quot;&gt;Jon Stewart's appeal&lt;/a&gt; to the Crossfire guys so many years ago. They never did help us, and now &lt;i&gt;thousands of Americans are dying. &lt;/i&gt;What will it take to wake the owners of the networks up. And the people, why are you watching this deadly animal garbage? Don't you get it? If you didn't watch they wouldn't broadcast. Don't you care about your own lives?</description>

			<description>When I edited yesterday's piece about my grandfather &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/06/152004.html?title=rudyKiesler&quot;&gt;Rudy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;, I stumbled across a reference to him as a &quot;German Jewish communist,&quot; on a page about &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimili.com/en/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, who was my grandmother's brother, Rudy's brother-in-law, my mother's uncle and my great uncle. I thought that was super interesting. Because if you met Rudy you'd have thought he was a Republican, at least today you would. But he wasn't at all. He was super liberal. Our whole family was. It never occurred to me that he was a communist, but he might have been, esp from the point of view of Uncle Arno (who I never actually met).</description>

Apparently Salant shut it down when they went bankrupt in the 80s, they must have sold the name to Bernie Braverman, who worked for Rudy. I remember him, since I worked in the office one summer (the summer of the Watergate hearings). United Pioneer, amazingly, still exists, but they wrote Rudy Kiesler out of the story. I've seen this happen many times, even with my own work. It must run in the family. Anyway the web is amazing, the trails are there for all of this, you just have to look, and now this is part of the story too.</description>

Didn't spend a lot of time thinking (or so it seemed to me as a child) he just burst into action. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was the 13th of 13 children, born in the land between Poland and Germany, sent off to fend for himself as a very young boy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jewish, he was deported in the first rounds of the Nazi regime, leaving my grandmother and mother behind. Lucie, my grandmother, was Lutheran, blonde-haired, blue-eyed Aryan princess. Why they married is something I never understood. They didn't seem to have anything in common.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the women were left in Germany or Czechoslavakia, I'm not clear on which, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+rudy+kiesler&amp;t=hy&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Rudy K&lt;/a&gt; was in Brooklyn or Queens, setting up a garment business, which he ran until he had a stroke in the 1970s. With no heir wanting to inherit the business, he sold the company, United Pioneer, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/53/Salant-Corporation.html&quot;&gt;Salant &amp; Salant&lt;/a&gt;. But he was always a bundle of energy, until he drifted away in a nursing home and died in the early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He would not have liked this &quot;stay home stay safe&quot; thing. I can't imagine he would have done it. He was the kind of guy who couldn't stand to wait in a line at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair&quot;&gt;World's Fair&lt;/a&gt;, so he'd cut in front of the person at the front of the line, and when they complained, he'd ignore them (this actually happened). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/22/kieslers.gif&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/09/22.html#l60a1aad9dbba17d33466766294610e29&quot;&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; in Rockaway probably in 1961 or so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was a legend. Still looms large in my mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Tabs on scripting.com</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I changed the way tabs work on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; home page.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are three tabs: Blog, Links and About.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click on a tab, you are redirected with a url of this form:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;http://scripting.com/?tab=&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; is the name of the tab you're going to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That way you always have a link to the tab in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the browser's Back button works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It used to do it all with JavaScript without redirecting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also no longer remembers what tab you had frontmost last time you visited the site. This was always annoying. Not a good heuristic. When I come to scripting.com 99 times out of 100 I want to see the blog. It doesn't matter what I was looking at last time I visited. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/139&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago, has been on my todo list ever since, and I finally got around to doing it. It's even worse than it appears. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Highly recommend this week's Radio Open Source interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/the-pandemics-path/&quot;&gt;Laurie Garrett&lt;/a&gt; who is an eloquent expert on the pandemic. I had heard her interviewed elsewhere, this time &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Garrett&quot;&gt;she&lt;/a&gt; gets all 50 minutes, and she's brilliant, deeply informed and passionate.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/covid19/covid-counter.html&quot;&gt;This is great&lt;/a&gt;. Stanford University is setting up a network of Americans around the country to track their symptoms and exposure to people with CV. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/23.html#a154211&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; traveled through Seoul on her way home, she had to install a mobile app to keep a diary of her symptoms, if any. This is how they do containment, and it's great to see a similar system starting in the US, from a credible institution like Stanford. We're on the road now. Every American reader of this blog should sign up for daily reminders, and do it. If I could make it a requirement, I would. America being smart.</description>

			<description>I am old enough to remember what was left after polio. Not old enough to have gotten it myself, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine&quot;&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; already existed when I was born. But there were kids in my school that had been crippled by it.</description>

			<description>I'm okay with people going to church as long as we can lock the doors after they're all inside. They should not be allowed to re-enter society after being so reckless with their own health. On FB they're saying they should stay inside for 14 days and those without symptoms be allowed to leave. I am reminded of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/05/never.png&quot;&gt;New Yorker cartoon&lt;/a&gt;. I think &quot;never&quot; is a better time to let them out.</description>
