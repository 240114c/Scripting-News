			<description>I had to drive to the car dealer today to pick up my car. Along the way, I had many opportunities to pick up the virus. First was when I crossed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston%E2%80%93Rhinecliff_Bridge&quot;&gt;Rhinecliff Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and had to stop to pay a toll. The toll booth operator had gloves on. I gave her six quarters and before continuing, I wiped the hand that touched hers. Her glove was accumulating all the viruses on everyone's hands who paid the toll. At the dealer, I had to sign a form to get my car back. They gave me a pen to use. I had no idea who else had used the pen. They did have hand sanitizer on the desk. I used it. Also thought about stealing it, but didn't. When I got my car, I rubbed down the steering wheel with sanitizer. Forgot to wipe the gear shift or the controls for the heating system, until after I touched them. On the way back I got a car wash. Paid the attendant $12 in cash, and he gave me change, again in cash. I thought about all the people who had touched the bills, including the attendant.</description>

			<description>I had anxiety about Covid19 for the first time this morning. This could be it. But if it isn't, I have some great software in mind. Funny how being this scared brings out the creativity. On the other hand if this is the time to go -- I'd rather have it be in a plot of a terrible science fiction novel than say going in my sleep. The drama of Trump's speech last night. At one point I thought he was losing it and was going to start talking like Jerry Lewis in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/neEe1itDC_k?t=320&quot;&gt;Nutty Professor&lt;/a&gt;. I think that would have been good for everyone, but he got himself back on track. His eyes are dead. No one home.</description>

			<description>Instead of listening to podcasts about the virus I started listening to a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Break-Shot-First-Years-Memoir/dp/B081D93GP6&quot;&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; today -- James Taylor's memoir. The audiobook is the way to go because he plays his guitar while he's narrating. Many of his famous songs are all autobiographical. And his story is surprising. I didn't know anything about him. (Hold on. It's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/02/09/803843220/james-taylor-narrates-life-before-fame-and-sings-american-standards-on-new-album&quot;&gt;audio memoir&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>BTW, you can read this blog without using Twitter. I try to make sure of that. But imho it is way better if you do use Twitter. I see this as expediant. I could clone Twitter, and wait for everyone to use it, and I might end up waiting forever. And I don't have that much time. Or I could just use Twitter. It's like driving my car with Exxon gas. I'm sure some of the gas I put in the car actually comes from a hated company. But what the fuck. I can't fight every battle.</description>

			<title>Why Hillary Clinton isn't president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Four years later, after watching the 2020 campaign, I think I finally understand why we didn't have a woman president the last four years. No surprise -- of course it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; because of our attitude toward gender, and the way it forms women's public personalities. I don't know how it gets better, but first imho you have to understand the problem. Here's the story from my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, so I noticed things from a woman's point of view that I normally wouldn't. In debates, Bernie Sanders yelled over her or waved his hands in her face. She couldn't respond in kind. I wanted the moderators to put a stop to it. She couldn't respond in kind because who would tolerate a woman who behaved like that. Exactly why we shouldn't tolerate a man behaving like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I hear people say they hate Hillary Clinton, I remember when I hated her too. I remember exactly the moment that changed. Listening to an incredibly smart and well-spoken women being interviewed on NPR and stopping the car and waiting to find out who it was. Hillary Clinton. This was in the 90s when she was First Lady. Ever since I've challenged my assumptions on why I hate a public figure. I think about it, and decide whether that's correct. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The source of the hate was resentment. Who was she to have such a public voice. The bug was that of course she had earned a public voice. As wife of the president, she wasn't as she said the kind of woman who stays home and bakes cookies. She was very much part of the presidency. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, Hillary Clinton eventually became a Senator then a Secretary and then a candidate for president. Of course I supported her. Over the years I had come to appreciate her intelligence, hard work, thoughtfulness, all the qualities you want in a president. But one. She often lacked confidence. She was incredible of course, I could not do what she did, that's not the point. You can feel confidence in another person, and hers was fragile, a surface-level thing, it's where the sense she wasn't &quot;authentic&quot; came from. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When she was finally coasting to victory, the wind at her back, you could feel it, she could feel it, all of a sudden it comes crashing down, with another &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/&quot;&gt;bogus attack&lt;/a&gt;, the kind she had been suffering her whole life, the process that knocked her confidence down so thoroughly. She collapsed. You could see it in every speech, every interview. She was doing a great job of trying to hide it, but it couldn't be hidden. She was defeated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;HRC had been going through this all her life. It scarred her. She tried to do something that in her time proved to be impossible. There's no shame in that, but that is imho why she isn't president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;1. An instant transformation of the economics of health care in the US. Single payer for everything, for everyone, now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2. The US govt pays for sick leave for all sick employees who don't have sick leave from their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think trillions, not billions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Our precarious position</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I know pretty much everyone who reads this blog probably loved math in school and won't need a refresher in how exponential growth works, but just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's 20 steps. We started out with two cases of Covid19, and after 20 weeks, assuming a doubling of cases every week, we're at over a million. And I'm sure you can go on from there. It isn't very long until everyone on the planet has had the disease. No one is immune.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It kills a fair number of those people, even if they are hospitalized. But at some point, say the 15th week, we will have completely used up all the hospital beds, and then the death rate will go way up. Maybe you don't get killed, but some large portion of your friends and family do. Even if you survive, you may wish you hadn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're venturing into the unknown. Life is always like that, but at most times we can hide it from ourselves, we go on with our usual routine. Most days are pretty ordinary. We have a hard time understanding that sometimes the comfortable daily humdrum can break. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina&quot;&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans, I went there, to see what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html#newOrleansCoffeeNotes&quot;&gt;post-apocalyptic American experience&lt;/a&gt; was like. I knew the city well because I had gone to college there. What I saw was a city that would never recover from what happened. It would continue, that was obvious, but it would never again be the city I knew. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are smart things we can do, and unfortunately in the United States, we aren't doing them. Of course. We're too stupid to think these things through. Our government sees this as an opportunity to shovel more money to themselves and their cronies. No thought is put into easing the strain on the health care system. On making it easy for every sick person to get the care they need, hospitalization, or the ability to stay home when sick so they don't infect others. To increase the survival rate, and slow the spread. We still haven't gotten the message that we all lose when people among us who are sick go untreated, especially when with a viral infectious disease for which no one is immune. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The smart thing to do right now would be to quickly replace our government with one that is immersed in the math and logic of virality. To get Sanders off the campaign trail and in Washington to plead the case for single payer health care now, for everyone. He, unlike most Congress people, has the attention of the press. We need to close down every opportunity for the virus to infect masses of people, and treat and isolate those who do get infected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The mayor of New York, supposedly a smart person, has yet to cancel the St Patrick's Day parade. No doubt it &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be canceled, but the idea that at this late date it hasn't, tells you someone in authority who is not insane (unlike our president) hasn't figured out how this works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're now paying the price for the dumbing-down of our country. As one of the more vulnerable people (not the most, but close) I am sad that my fate is in the hands of such incompetence. I'm doing what I can to spread the information that we're wasting the gift of time we were given, we can learn from the experience of Italy, Iran and China. But of course, we aren't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Think about it this way. What if you got a 2-week advance notice that something really shitty was about to happen, and you actually know a lot about what will happen. I listened to a podcast with an expert on this stuff, and he said we got lucky this time. Imagine that. We got lucky, weird, but yes we did.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our friends in Italy are telling us we should learn from their experience and use the couple of weeks extra time we have to prepare. They appear to be doing this in Washington state. But not so much here in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Those who survive the virus will have to live in its aftermath. The economy is going to stop like the economy in New Orleans did after Katrina. One of the big lessons of Katrina was that once stopped, it takes a long time for an economy to reboot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not blaming gov Cuomo. People have to be mobilized.  They're mobilized in Wash because they have the biggest outbreak in the US so far. And we are soft in the west, we can't imagine things being not-normal.   People in New Orleans however I'm sure are aware of the hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must play hold music make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc&quot;&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When last night's email went out, it sent Saturday's posts, not Sunday's. This is pretty hard to debug, I'd have to recreate the conditions of various databases at midnight last night. At first I thought the problem must be related to the Daylight Savings Time switch on Saturday night, but on second thought, how could it? It doesn't really seem likely. And the relevant machines auto-updated their clocks. So for now, I'm going to wait to see what happens tonight. If the right stuff goes out, then I'll just call it an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case&quot;&gt;edge case&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray&quot;&gt;cosmic rays&lt;/a&gt; (programmerese for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_God&quot;&gt;Act of God&lt;/a&gt;) and move on.</description>

			<description>A simple idea. We need testing of the Covid-19 virus. More testing is better -- and sooner. The US government isn't moving fast enough. Maybe Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple could get together to help us get tested, and then help scientists learn as much about where we're at as soon as possible. We need a Manhattan project, and it seems the capabilities of the tech industry would be well-applied here.</description>

			<title>Notes on Covid-19</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;These ideas are going to seem horribly naive in a few days probably, but based on lots of reading and listening this is what I think. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until there is massive testing we can't know where the virus is. Assuming it's everywhere is better than assuming it's nowhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emergency.yale.edu/be-prepared/shelter-place&quot;&gt;Shelter in place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;Self-quarantine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The reason to self-quarantine is two-fold. 1. To minimize the chance that you get the virus and 2. to slow its transmission. It uses our bodies to get to other bodies. If we don't have it, we can't transmit it. If we do, if we don't move around we can't transmit it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Only go out to get food and other supplies, and to work if you can. That's an ideal of course, not achievable in most countries, esp not the US, which doesn't have health care for all, or paid sick leave, or for that matter a functioning government.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hope that essential services can be maintained, electric, water, the supply chain for food, health care. Expect lots of outages. Hope is really all we have at this point when it comes to maintaining our way of life. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the government can't implement massive testing, we have to do it. We'll need excellent data management functions so we can do all kinds of queries on the data, to determine what comes next. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to say this, we should get Trump out of the loop of this, he's much more lethal than the virus. The government that comes after Trump, hopefully very soon, must implement a TARP-like program to vastly expand health care funding and funneling money to people who can't go to work because they have the virus, to help slow transmission. Also to parents who have to stay home to take care of kids who aren't going to school. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The rate cut by the Fed was insane btw, if we get out of this, we're going to need the ability to drop interest rates to stimulate the economy (experience from Katrina, a stopped economy is slow to restart). The rate cut can't do anything to stimulate an economy that is coming to a halt for non-market reasons. If people have more money in their pocket (they won't but if they did) they aren't going to go to Walmart to buy a new fridge and risk getting a virus that might kill them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Went grocery shopping today. Found it impossible not to put my fingers in my mouth when trying to open the plastic bags for fruit and produce. Touching all kinds of surfaces that probably are infected. The place had a Thanksgiving-like feel to it. Could just be a Friday thing in late winter. I've been stocking up on canned goods. I buy about twice as much as I need every week. Also noted there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/06/plentyOfToiletPaperInHannafords.png&quot;&gt;plenty of toilet paper&lt;/a&gt; on the shelves. Apparently people here aren't so scared of running out. The only thing that was in short supply was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/home&quot;&gt;Bread Alone&lt;/a&gt; bread, for some reason. I should've asked. It looks like they're not going to carry it in the future? That would be not good.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1235645351668764673&quot;&gt;Asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: I have a Mac and an iPhone. What's the best way to get a text file from my Mac onto my iPhone. Best == least work. Lots of answers. The thing I like about email the best is that the same approach works from a browser-based app like &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. I can add email capabilities there so I can make a list in the outliner and email it to my phone. That will be beautiful.</description>

			<description>We will look back at March 2020 as the good old days when the virus was more or less contained. Will we ever get back to this level again of containment? What will the survivors witness? What will be left if our economy? Will anyone ever say again we donâ€™t need government?</description>
