			<description>My NYC correspondent. &quot;At least two co-workers sound like they have it, but both have been doing fine with mild symptoms (it's a young and healthy group, though). This is bad, but I think by June NYC is going to be the most resilient and functional city, with experience and infrastructure and also lots of people who are resistant because they've already gotten it. California is doing really well with distancing but I'm worried they'll face a bad second wave in the fall.&quot;</description>

			<description>Why do reporters keep showing up for Trump pressers, and then spend endless hours talking about it. It's like the character in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Harry_Met_Sally...&quot;&gt;Harry Met Sally&lt;/a&gt; played by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Fisher&quot;&gt;Carrie Fisher&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ww5v_CYXBw&quot;&gt;You're right&lt;/a&gt;, you're right he's never going to leave her.</description>

			<description>I wish there were a fully networked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ea.com/games/simcity&quot;&gt;SimCity&lt;/a&gt; where my friends' cities and mine could trade. And we could have lockdowns and shut down the airports, and have Covid-19 outbreaks. We could kill all the Sims, and then boom, reincarnate them.</description>

			<description>Every day I start with a blank slate here on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder if I'll find anything to put here. Maybe today it will be an empty page? Then I have breakfast, drink some coffee, catch up on what people are saying, and then comes the flood. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>From Dave Carlick a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZtEX2-n2Hc&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from the Czech Republic minister of health saying it's time for everyone to wear a mask. I had mask-envy. People have such nice store-bought masks. I have some on order from Amazon, but who knows when they'll be here. Just got an email saying oops we're going to be late. Maybe May or June. In the meantime a neighbor made me a beautful denim mask (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/30.html#a143558&quot;&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;) which I will wear proudly when I go to town.</description>

			<title>A story we aren't covering yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've privately encouraged a few reporter friends to look into what it's like to die from &quot;CV&quot;, and report on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My imagination says it's very horrible. But maybe it isn't as bad as I imagine and maybe they knock you out for the most painful parts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know you can request a DNR, thinking of writing it on my body in Sharpie. But can you also request palliative treatment? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, how are supplies of the palliatives?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a huge story, and as far as I can see no one is covering it. It would take a lot of courage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/1244652098589011976&quot;&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Like with mass shootings or war zones, there's a media pact not to present the battlefield to the public.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1244652248396955651&quot;&gt;I respond&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;This is different. The people they're reporting to &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the battlefield.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Dev work: A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/24.html#a204119&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; how to use regex to mash up paths for web requests. In the end I went another way, adding a long-wanted plug-in capability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt;, my labor-of-love Node-based web server. I found a really Nodey way to do it, much better imho than using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_vm.asp&quot;&gt;vm&lt;/a&gt;. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_modules.asp&quot;&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html&quot;&gt;modules&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of people don't know they can be in files, not just distributed through NPM. It's a really nice way to do plug-ins, and it's made something cool possible with Little Outliner. More on that later. In the meantime I've written up the use of modules as PagePark plug-ins in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/158#issuecomment-605650163&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about regex.&lt;i&gt; Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html&quot;&gt;must-read article&lt;/a&gt;. Summary. There won't be enough testing, probably for the rest of the year. Same with ventilators and gear to protect the medical people. What's missing is national leadership, to tell people the truth, let us know what we're needed to do. We can accept that. What is killing us is the constant chaos.</description>

			<description>The companies didnâ€™t need bailouts. Take United Airlines for example. They would have gone bankrupt, their assets sold to pay creditors. There would still be a United Airlines. The planes would still fly. The shareholders would have lost everything. Owning stock is risky, or it should be -- especially when you don't save for a rainy day as United didn't. Same old shit. Upside is private. Downside is socialist. We need real health care, people need food, a place to live, a job. We had the opportunity now to ensure all that. Weâ€™re trying to prop up an old obsolete system. People are left to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21197279/coronavirus-us-unemployment-health-insurance&quot;&gt;fend&lt;/a&gt; for themselves, but stockholders are made whole.</description>

			<title>Why hibernate?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Increase your chance of survival when you get the virus.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Slow the rate of transmission of the virus.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One reason for you, another for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are working feverishly on treatments and a vaccine. The latter will prevent you from getting infected, but it's a long way off. But treatments could come about any day. The longer you hold on, the more likely you will survive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If everyone stayed in, the transmission of the virus would almost halt. You could still get it from someone you live with. But that's it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we can't be perfect. We need doctors, food, electric, internet, etc. So the best we can do is slow the rate. The slower it gets, the more time we give the scientists to find a treatment or vaccine. And the better the chance you survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I heard someone parrot what the president said about how car accidents kill 65K people a year, yet we don't shut down the car industry. So why do we all have to hibernate in isolation while the scientists find a treatment or a vaccine for this killer disease, Covid-19. I suppose it's good to explain, one time, in one place, why a virus is different from a car accident, using Twitter as an example. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most things I post on Twitter are not viral. One or two people may RT it, and that's it. Once in a while I post something does go viral. That means a few people RT to people who then RT it to people who then RT it, etc. Sooner or later 100K people have seen my stupid little tweet. Covid-19 is like that. If you have it, and you don't isolate, you will give it to 3 other people, and they will give it to 3 more people, and so on. Very quickly a million people have it. It goes viral. I'm sure Trump has used that word perhaps without really understanding what it means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now why is that a problem? We'll answer that in the next lesson. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/profits-or-people/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; is worth a listen. The economics of Coronavirus. They breezed by a huge issue. Millions of Americans without health insurance, no savings, no job, sick, homeless, hungry, plus guns. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/21.html#a011845&quot;&gt;ticking time bomb&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about briefly on March 21. The so-called stimulus Congress passed, what a joke, does nothing to address this. I would much preferred see the $2 trillion give everyone the health care they need, keep us all fed, and reboot the economy around serving the people of the country. The UK did this, by guaranteeing 80% of people's salaries for the duration. They already have a national health care system. We are headed for a big crash. Congress didn't deal with it.</description>

			<description>I don't feel good about this. I was glad to hear Boris Johnson got the CV, not because I hold anything against him, but if he can get it so can Trump. And I think that would be good for Americans who are scared out of our minds about this disease esp because our president is not.</description>

			<description>If our country is to have strong national borders, we need a uniform lockdown policy across the whole country. Or else we have to form federations of states with identical policies. This is starting to happen in the northeast, btw.</description>
