			<description>My friend Blogdiva is back. She &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blogdiva/status/1085676510378426373&quot;&gt;loves&lt;/a&gt; the new Congress. Me too. They're the Beatles, I say. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWbiVqlSMgc&quot;&gt;Hard Day's Night&lt;/a&gt; she said. Yes! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>The Gillette commercial</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A bunch of comments...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I heard about the commercial my first reaction was why are they doing this. If their products mostly sell to men this will hurt them in sales. It's hard for men (and women too) to defend the gender without invoking the ire of others, so mostly people stay silent and let the myth that men are responsible for the problems in our society go unchallenged. But you can push back via private acts, like choosing another brand, or voting. In private contexts you can be very vocal without fear of retribution. So even if you don't hear the pushback, it could come at the cash register.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Or maybe there's something I don't understand. Even if Gillette is a brand for men, maybe it's women who most often make the purchasing decision. Or maybe Gillette is struggling and they can use the controversy to help rekindle brand awareness?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I searched on Amazon for other brands of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=shaving+razors+for+men&quot;&gt;shaving razors for men&lt;/a&gt;, and wow, Gillette appears to own the category. All the ads are for Gillette products. They are the Google of men's shaving. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ironically there are men who take this opportunity to abuse other men if they object. The assumption is if you don't like the Gillette message, for any reason, you must be an abuser. Of course this makes no sense. Today my Twitter timeline has had quite a few male-abusive tantrums from accounts that appear to be authored by men. Of course any account could be written by a troll of any gender.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've written this many times, women have better PR than men.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Women can be awful. Is it toxic? I won't go there. I don't like that word applied to men, so I also wouldn't like it applied to women. However I have seen women do unspeakably awful things. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;With all those disclaimers, I was moved to tears in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0&quot;&gt;watching the Gillette commercial&lt;/a&gt; because I am moved when I see people of any gender standing up for people who are being ganged up on, or taken advantage of. I just wish they had taken a balanced approach. Boys have to learn to deal with girls too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'll tell you a story about that. I once witnessed my two nieces who of course I love, taunt a boy the same age. The boy was helpless. After it was over, I took him aside and told him I saw what happened, and I thought it was wrong. It's important to watch out for this, and help kids, no matter what their gender. All kids start out innocent. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're still listening here's the closer. Every boy had a mother. We create each other. If you want kids to be good, be good to them. Set an example. Try to see things from their point of view. Help them. Listen. Share your values, but don't try to change them. Even kids have the right to decide who they are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A friend who's about 10 years younger than me wrote a blog post a while back saying that he was going to stop writing software in about 10 years because he'd be too old to do it at that time. I'm sure he didn't say it to offend me, but it did. He has no idea. And btw that was about five years ago, and he's still going strong. Heh. Also, the other day I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1084300107594588160&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; saying that I strive for simplicity in my programming work. I've been doing that ever since I read the source code to a famous OS and saw how clean and sparse it was. I wanted to do that too. That was 40-plus years ago. Today I write cleaner code than I could have at any other point in my career. The younger version of myself could imagine what I do today, but couldn't do it. So the myth that programming is something you forget how to do, or can't do, as you get older is a lie. It's not like basketball or skiing. It's a discipline. And as you get older, you get better. I'm not saying that because I want it to be true (as many people probably think) rather because it is true.</description>

			<description>I had a change in perspective on the shutdown. It isn't a sign of ineptness, it's an attack on the country. Connect the dots. Who's in the White House and where does he get his orders. Thought I would share that, of course no one listens. ;-)</description>

			<description>I watched a bit of MSNBC last night, and had another shift in perspective. There's nothing more for them to say. They're repeating things, aghast, that we knew two years ago, that they were aghast at then, when they were fresh. The shift was this. They feel as helpless as I do. Might as well enjoy ourselves. We're stuck. The only ones with any power are the useful idiot in the White House and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; of course and Nancy Pelosi.</description>

			<description>In the late 90s I got a call from Bill Gates's office saying they wanted to discuss Internet identity. Until then I hadn't thought about it much, because the web was barely used for commerce; there were no massive social networks. This was before all that. Now many years later, I understand the problem well, I've lived it, so far without much cost. There's a huge societal vulnerability because we don't have control of identity for many important things, like banking, loans, all kinds of property ownership, as well as the social risks. But because money is so central to identity, it's surprising that there isn't a Google or Amazon of identity. Seems there's money to be made here. An organization with physical branches everywhere, with people in them who can help with indentity problems. Starbucks would have a good start. Amazon, Google and Apple probably have plans for it.</description>

There's a huge societal vulnerability because we don't have control of identity for many important things, like banking, loans, all kinds of property ownership, as well as the social risks. But because money is so central to identity, it's surprising that there isn't a Google or Amazon of identity. Seems there's money to be made here. An organization with physical branches everywhere, with people in them who can help with indentity problems. Starbucks would have a good start. Amazon, Google and Apple probably have plans for it." created="Sun, 13 Jan 2019 15:43:56 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/13/starbucks.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/01/13.html#a154356"/>

			<description>Starbucks also seems well-positioned to be a cannabis retailer. It's the perfect environment to buy and consume.</description>

			<description>Oy the horse race is so boring. Bernie or Biden or Warren or whatever. Whoever the Dems nominate we'd better all vote for them. That's why it's all such bullshit. It doesn't matter who gets nominated. Whoever it is, they will be infinitely more suited than the Repub.</description>

			<description>Trump is a Putin-loyal oligarch. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/12/trumpWithRussiansInOval.png&quot;&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; to see where he fits in. He's comfortable with these guys. He's probably a bit more senior than they, but not much. And he's thought to be an idiot by them, but a &lt;i&gt;powerful&lt;/i&gt; idiot. (Goes beyond the usual &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot&quot;&gt;useful&lt;/a&gt; idiot.)</description>

			<description>Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/11/180256.html&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on what you get when you download your archive from Flickr. Later I remembered I was archiving my Flickr site in an S3 bucket and this morning I figured out where it was. And now I'm looking through old pictures, that are already saved. For example, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2007/january/&quot;&gt;January 2007&lt;/a&gt; I went to CES and (apparently) was moving into my new house in Berkeley. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/&quot;&gt;June&lt;/a&gt; I was in Rome, and also was waiting in &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/dscn7807jpg&quot;&gt;line&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/dscn7800jpg&quot;&gt;Scobles&lt;/a&gt; for the very first &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2007/june/afterTappingTheScreen&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Imagine that American politics since 2015 was a series like Game of Thrones or The Sopranos.

			<title>Time for a demonstration?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe now's a good time for a protest? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember how we marched on Inauguration Day in 2017. Maybe a big push right now would have an even bigger effect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An idea: Cancel all trips that involve air travel until the shutdown is over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Impeachment is driven by public sentiment. It can't and shouldn't happen until a substantial majority of the people demand it, not just favor it. You don't casually impeach and remove a president, you can't do it only on principle. It has to be driven by the public determination.</description>

			<description>More on the dual-major journalism and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/10/17/howIdTeachComputerScience.html&quot;&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt; program. Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/10.html#a175302&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; how that could be great for journalism, now I want to talk about the flip side, how it's great for the software journalists use, i.e. publishing software. In my experience the best software is that which is designed by people who use the product. They bump against the limits as users do, think of shortcuts and simplifications (called factoring in software). If you don't use the software your ideas about how it should work are theoretical. The closer you are to the user experience, the better you understand the tradeoffs from the user's perspective. And that ultimately is the most important one. So applied to this dual-major concept when the students learn their comp sci, it can be in the context of how journalists use computer systems. And with better understanding of users on the part of the students, after all they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; users, the better the publishing software can be.</description>

			<description>HBO has been playing all the Sopranos episodes back to back for a few days. Yesterday by luck I hit on the very last episode. Earlier in the day I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/the-sopranos-ending-does-tony-die.html&quot;&gt;read a debate&lt;/a&gt; on what happened at the end. I am of the school that yeah of course he died, but the person who took the opposite position was convincing. We don't know what happened at the end so leave it there. But I got to see all the scenes that were discussed, the same day. Intense, and fun.</description>

			<title>We can't budge on the so-called wall</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, I am not a Democrat. I'm an independent but these days I vote straight Democrat because what the Republicans have become is so abhorrent to me. We're at the very baseline of governance in the US. Do you or do you not stand for the Constitution? Today only the Dems do. The Repubs do not.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if Pelosi and Schumer give the president &quot;the wall&quot; which I put in quotes because we have no clue what it means, we are giving into the idea that &lt;i&gt;a majority of the American electorate have no say in how the country is run.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've been pushed to the limit by the Repubs. They wouldn't confirm Merrick Garland. They have installed a majority on the court even though they don't represent a majority in the country. The latest appointee slandered the court during his confirmation hearings. It's going to get worse. They gerrymandered Congressional districts so that in order to control the House the Dems have to win a landslide, which they did, in 2018, and even so, according to the Repubs, have no say in governance.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Enough. We have a system of government. Respect it. Trump's &quot;wall&quot; is an imaginary thing. It's an example of the emperor with no clothes. If we can't stand against this and say no, and have it stick, then we have given up any hope of ever having self-government in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What I got from Flickr</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I requested to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/how-to-save-flickr-photos-deleted-download&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; all the info Flickr has about me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/08.html#a233006&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, got the data on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/09.html#a203957&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, and yesterday I spent a couple of hours trying to figure out what I got. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There were 14 zip files, each containing one folder.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Total of 6.59GB. 12,729 files&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;13 of the folders contain JPG images. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One folder, named 72157704082859561_da410b4a23fb_part1, contained only JSON files, 36.8MB, 6366 files. The vast majority of the JSON files have names like photo_6594805.json. I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/misc/flickrJsonFile.json&quot;&gt;uploaded&lt;/a&gt; one of the files to the Scripting News repo, so you can see what kind of data you get about each image. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Each of the 13 folders contains files with names like dsc02455jpg_76330356_o.jpg. The dates on the files unfortunately are all the same, they don't say when the photos were taken. This would be helpful in piecing things together. It appears the first part of the name, before the underscore, is derived from the name of the file. Then following the first underscore and before the second is a number, which appears to be the identifier of the picture. This I believe is the connection between the image and the JSON file, above.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I loaded the JSON files into a section of a Frontier object database, and the names of the JPG files into another section. I wrote a script that looped over all the data from the JSON files, got the ID and then checked if there were images to go with that ID. 5816 image files existed and 533 didn't. Not bad, but far from perfect. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/misc/flickrMissingIds.txt&quot;&gt;list of IDs&lt;/a&gt; for which there were no images. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried to generate a static site using this info, but it seems you could. It would be missing some images, about 9 percent.  Even so, it would have been really nice if Flickr delivered it in that format. It's nice to have the JSON files, but most users won't be able to use them unless software is written, and they find it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just skimmed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss&quot;&gt;Vice article&lt;/a&gt; about RSS. Up front they make it sound like something dramatic happened. That gravestone image was pretty bad. Someday it'll come back to them. ;-) Anyway there was, momentarily, some drama. The two groups wanted to do very different things. Netscape, as far as I'm concerned, wanted to bootstrap syndication of web content, and that was validated by the enormous popularity of RSS for that application. They had a vision that was right. And yes, they did one day just disappear. I wanted to preserve the progress we had made and build on it. I loved the idea since feeds provided exactly the level playing field I wanted for bloggers and pros. Look at all the good that came from that. Ask TechCrunch or Daring Fireball, Daily Kos or Talking Points Memo. And podcasting. These things all got their start because there was that level playing field. That vision was what was driving me. Ultimately the two forks went their separate ways, as they should have, because we were going different places. It's unfortunate both were called RSS, but if you study the history of tech standards these kinds of tales of woe are more the rule than the exception. It's a good story. I guess, for me it's the ancient past.</description>

			<description>Apparently several American universities are starting a new double-major, Journalism and Computer Science. I've been asked for input to one of the programs, and have started to think about it. One immediate idea is that the students will be able to write about technical topics without &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+obfuscate&quot;&gt;obfuscation&lt;/a&gt;. Examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hillary%27s+emails&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's emails&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=facebook%27s+api+scandals&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Facebook's API&lt;/a&gt;. They sound like scandals when the NYT writes about them, but what are the actual facts. Believe it or not, they don't say. The business and political press will do what they do, write shallow and inflammatory versions of the story that cast the Hillary and Zuck (and of course others) in the worst possible light. But some of us want facts. At the beginning, so we know if there's anything to the allegations or are they just smears. There are millions of people today who understand what a mail server is, to them it's not a mystery. There should be some news that's written for people with that basic knowledge. The students in this program will be learning how to communicate about technology with a sense that the answers are knowable, and not mysterious. So there should be an immediate benefit to all of us, not just the students, from these programs.</description>

			<description>Another benefit of the new double-major -- journalism will be able to closely examine the behavior of other tech giants, not just Facebook. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has been trying to take control of the networking standard of the web, HTTP. This is not in the public interest, yet there has been no discussion of it in the press. That's wrong.</description>

			<description>Because our POTUS is wildly insane, the United States itself is wildly insane. For example, the big controversy over $5 billion for an imaginary thing is overshadowing a real existential crisis, climate change. OK climate change is hard to grasp. What about all the Americans shooting other Americans. Most are American citizens born and bred in the USA. White Christians. As Trump would say, not our best people.</description>

			<description>I had a thought that &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, probably the longest-running and super excellent podcast that was born out of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/bloggroup/&quot;&gt;Berkman Thursday&lt;/a&gt; group and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;, could be the centerpiece of a blogging and podcasting network. The people who contribute to ROS, their rolodex of interviewees, are incredible people, but here's something that we haven't begun to tap into -- I bet the &lt;i&gt;people who listen&lt;/i&gt; to it are equally incredible. Imagine tapping into their intellect, energy, expertise and vision. Could be very powerful.</description>

			<title>Frontier's S3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know why I didn't see this sooner, but Frontier's object database is the equivalent, in the world we built in the 90s, to Amazon S3, with a lot of advantages, most seeming prosaic, but very important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Names are case-insensitive&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's a hierarchic browser. You can look at two or more locations at the same time. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The browser is an editor. You can change the names or values of things without leaving the context, move an item from one location to another with drag and drop. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It handles small and large objects in the same way. A boolean or number is stored and edited the same way a text object, picture, blob, or sub-table is. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can see values of objects change in real-time with zero clicks. It's esp nice when you can see the values changing in more than one location. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The net&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The net result is you can build higher castles of functionality because so many details are handled by the platform. Errors stand out sooner. If you put something in the wrong place it's easier to see, and correcting it is no more steps than it has to be. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How I came to realize this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One of my development projects was stored in the wrong location on S3. I didn't realize it until I had to type the address in a different context. You see things on S3 through an awkward jumble of inconsistent commands. In Frontier you see your data, and interact with expand, collapse, point and click, drag and drop. Not new ideas. But S3 doesn't use them. They're there for a reason, to make work faster and help you spot errors faster. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Looking at how our HTTP framework, with integrated database access (see above) is Frontier's Lambda. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer Show&lt;/a&gt; discussing The Wall. They talk about it as if it's something that exists or is possible. As I understand it, we already have walls where ever it is practical. It's not possible to put a wall on a river, and much of the border between the US and Mexico is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande&quot;&gt;Rio Grande&lt;/a&gt;. You can't put a wall on the bank of a river. That's ridiculous. So I think before we have discussions about this thing that is supposedly possible, let's first address the question of whether it is.</description>

			<title>Working together, in 2019</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I listen to an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; I feel like writing an email to Chris Lydon and Mary McGrath, saying basically this. Everything your guests say is right on. I get so excited listening to them, they're so smart. But I want to add something, that the technology you're using contains the answer to the most basic problems they're talking about.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened again today on my way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport&quot;&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt;, riding on the E train to the Airtrain to Terminal 5. It was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/post-democracy-in-america/&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; about democracy from December 2016. Not sure how it ended up on my iPhone, but there it was, so I listened. The first guest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Lepore&quot;&gt;Jill Lepore&lt;/a&gt;, had been to the 2016 election postmortem &lt;a href=&quot;https://iop.harvard.edu/get-inspired/campaign-managers-conference/campaign-president-managers-look-2016&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; probably at Shorenstein, where the campaign managers of the major campaigns, 17 Repubs and 3 Dems talked about what worked and what didn't. Not one of them understood, she said (and I agreed), the underlying theme of the election, income inequality, but I believe the answer is deeper. Here's what I see. The world is going to hell, and I'm powerless to do anything about it. My life has no meaning. I want to make a difference but I can't. And the people who can are only thinking about furthering their own careers, not of the big picture. Here it is 2019 and still only a few people see the answer isn't any one of us, it's all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second guest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Mattei&quot;&gt;Ugo Mattei&lt;/a&gt;, a professor from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin&quot;&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt; (where I visited last summer!) got even closer, he said the magic words. He said the secret is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/30/122337.html&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt;. This is my mission. Ultimately that's going to be the way we dig out. That's the real 21st century revolution. Everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22working+together%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; in that direction. Working. Together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lepore also talks about how technology has been a distraction for the Democrats, offering to turn people into &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+slurry&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, and I cheered when I heard that. Of course tech is where I come from, but I went in a radically different direction from Zuck and Bezos. I see technology as empowering us all to take charge of journalism, the same way the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indivisible_movement&quot;&gt;indivisible movement&lt;/a&gt; empowered us to reform politics. You can't have one without the other. Most important we have to stop thinking of journalism as a way for a small number of people to earn a living and do a lousy job of serving the people's interest, and more of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/13/ideaAnIndivisibleGuideForJournalism.html&quot;&gt;civic calling&lt;/a&gt;, a way for all of us to add meaning to each others' lives. Until we get there, we'll keep electing losers like Trump and getting no further in solving the climate and social crises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to shake Chris and say hey you're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message&quot;&gt;doing it&lt;/a&gt;. The elites you talk with, the ones you choose, they get it. Now we just have to put this in practice. We're not getting any younger. Time is running out for our species. You just have to listen to Radio Open Source to hear that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I know I'm rambling. I'm excited. I believe in our future if we can get beyond our individual self-interest and start thinking and acting collectively. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The indivisible movement used the tools of technology, as does Chris's podcast. Remember that when you think tech created the problems, it did. But it also is empowering the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Whenever I listen to an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; I feel like writing an email to Chris Lydon and Mary McGrath, saying basically this. Everything your guests say is right on. I get so excited listening to them, they're so smart. But I want to add something, that the technology you're using contains the answer to the most basic problems they're talking about." created="Thu, 03 Jan 2019 16:33:16 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/02/26/snowboarder.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/01/03/162746.html#a163316"/>
				<source:outline text="It happened again today on my way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport&quot;&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt;, riding on the E train to the Airtrain to Terminal 5. It was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/post-democracy-in-america/&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; about democracy from December 2016. Not sure how it ended up on my iPhone, but there it was, so I listened. The first guest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Lepore&quot;&gt;Jill Lepore&lt;/a&gt;, had been to the 2016 election postmortem &lt;a href=&quot;https://iop.harvard.edu/get-inspired/campaign-managers-conference/campaign-president-managers-look-2016&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; probably at Shorenstein, where the campaign managers of the major campaigns, 17 Repubs and 3 Dems talked about what worked and what didn't. Not one of them understood, she said (and I agreed), the underlying theme of the election, income inequality, but I believe the answer is deeper. Here's what I see. The world is going to hell, and I'm powerless to do anything about it. My life has no meaning. I want to make a difference but I can't. And the people who can are only thinking about furthering their own careers, not of the big picture. Here it is 2019 and still only a few people see the answer isn't any one of us, it's all of us." created="Thu, 03 Jan 2019 16:34:46 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/01/03/162746.html#a163446"/>

He said the secret is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/30/122337.html&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt;. This is my mission. Ultimately that's going to be the way we dig out.

Everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22working+together%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; in that direction. Working.

Of course tech is where I come from, but I went in a radically different direction from Zuck and Bezos. I see technology as empowering us all to take charge of journalism, the same way the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indivisible_movement&quot;&gt;indivisible movement&lt;/a&gt; empowered us to reform politics. You can't have one without the other. Most important we have to stop thinking of journalism as a way for a small number of people to earn a living and do a lousy job of serving the people's interest, and more of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/13/ideaAnIndivisibleGuideForJournalism.html&quot;&gt;civic calling&lt;/a&gt;, a way for all of us to add meaning to each others' lives.

			<description>I'm having an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://scripting.com/2018/12/30/124007.html#annotations:eGxEYg1ZEemlC1Pk-PD_kg&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; with longtime friend Jon Udell, but I think we're discussing different things. I'm trying to say we don't have a good way to explain features in languages and environments to people who aren't schooled in the environment. So if I say X has a feature no other environment has, people will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; say it &quot;sounds like&quot; something they've seen in environment A, B and C. But &quot;sounds like&quot; is not good enough. If for example Billy Joel were to claim he had written a great new song, then played it on the piano and it was obviously Hey Jude, you could say Hey Billy that &quot;sounds like&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A_MjCqQoLLA?t=48&quot;&gt;Hey Jude&lt;/a&gt; and you'd have a good idea that you are right. Because music has a universal instrument for sharing tunes, the piano. Software does not. I hoped JavaScript would be it. But maybe it is. I'll try demoing the feature I was talking about in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/30/124007.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; Jon was commenting on, using JavaScript.</description>

			<title>Facebook really is dying</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You know I hate the word &quot;dead&quot; applied to things that were never alive, but in this case I can't think of a better way to say it. Facebook is turning into a ghost town. Here's how I know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite features on Facebook is when they show you every day what you posted there on the same day 1, 2, 3 etc years ago. Through that lens you can see what you were doing on their platform in the past. And these days it's been by far the most interesting thing on Facebook, because for me at least it used to be a vibrant interesting place. Not no more.     &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Caveat: Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One factor in my perception is they shut off my ability to post via their API. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblogging&lt;/a&gt; used to flow through Facebook as it does now through Twitter and RSS. And from that, conversations would grow, leading to other ideas, that led to more posts. But now that that channel is closed off, the activity has moved elsewhere. I understand why they did it, fake news, but it had a cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example in 2017 on this day I posted a comment about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/02/smugPilots.png&quot;&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; that I cribbed from somewhere, with an appeal to understand why people might have voted for Trump, and why it's tragic that we couldn't work together as citizens instead of crashing the country, which is what Trump was going to do and clearly is doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/02/smugPilots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I keep posting everywhere I can to please tell Trump that we're tired of winning as he predicted we would be. Maybe he should retire to Mar-a-lago or Moscow or where ever they'll have him. A low-security Federal prison perhaps? It could be just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQV6CijIzrc&quot;&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's good that Facebook is dying. I do believe in the death penalty for corporations. They have behaved obscenely, without regard for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&quot;&gt;natural resources&lt;/a&gt; that made their company possible. It's as if Exxon could rape the planet without any environmental controls. Not just Facebook -- Google too, and every other tech company, because they're all staffed by the people drawn from the same talent pool. Profits before everything. This is what you get. I don't think the press have fully grokked this yet. They're just nibbling at the edges. Maybe that's all they'll ever do? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
