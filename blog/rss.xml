			<description>More and more I use Twitter to write the first drafts of posts that I then write more fully &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/03.html#a142736&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. It really is becoming the context for my blogging, a very different role from what it played a few years ago. The 280-char limit is a very important change, but I think other things matter too. People are taking Twitter more seriously? Each of us sees &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant&quot;&gt;something different&lt;/a&gt; of course.</description>

			<description>Going forward with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;XML-RPC in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; project. I realized I &lt;s&gt;should&lt;/s&gt; must include an HTTP server in the package. It's nice that you can use the protocol over any transport, and use JSON in place of XML, but there is a standard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html&quot;&gt;RPC over XML via HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. So this is what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/43fc83d0cbfe811dcac284fa3890f291&quot;&gt;typical server&lt;/a&gt; looks like with those assumptions. Much simpler than it would otherwise be, which of course is the point of using XML-RPC. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üòÅ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>How the NY Times came to support RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: I posted this &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/02/09/how-the-ny-times-came-to-support-rss/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on a wordpress.com site in 2006, but it should be part of the scripting.com archive. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The history of RSS is usually told only in one dimension, it‚Äôs the story of geeks fighting with geeks, so they say, but in my humble opinion, that‚Äôs really not the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the vocal people on the mail lists, blogs and wikis are more fans than creators. It‚Äôs as if we confused baseball players with people who sit in the stands watching a baseball game. Sure, both wear caps and want their team to win, but one actually does something about it, while the others expresses an opinion. There are a lot of fans, but relatively few people who actually do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mike Lopez, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/#comment-1302&quot;&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on this blog yesterday recalls a story he heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5195825&quot;&gt;on NPR&lt;/a&gt; about basketball great Wilt Chamberlain and his relationship with fans. Chamberlain‚Äôs philosophy: it‚Äôs easier to humor them than to argue with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Analogously, in the age of Wikipedia, fans can give themselves credit not just for being there when Wilt had his amazing 100 point game, but they can actually claim to have had the 100 point game themselves. Welcome to the Internet. Community participation is both its strongest and weakest point. And those who say I‚Äôm a consistent supporter of the medium miss that I am as frequently its victim. Sadly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NY Times is not a sideline player in the history of RSS, as I‚Äôve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/20/rss-came-from-the-publishing-industry-2/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, they played a central role, first denying us permission to use their content, then allowing it, and in doing so, providing an example for the rest of the publishing industry, which followed their lead without undermining them, without reinventing the technology, to their credit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was on this day &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/02/09.html&quot;&gt;in 2001&lt;/a&gt; that I received a call from a ‚ÄúRights and Contracts manager‚Äù at the New York Times, she asked us to stop reading their XML newsfeeds. I complied with the request. A colleague who will remain nameless had snuck me a link to an unprotected directory where the feeds, in a proprietary XML-based format, resided. I then repurposed the information and published it on a UserLand server. Truth be told, I expected to be shut down, but in doing so, I also expected to get the attention of higher-ups at the Times (who I knew read my blog) and it surely did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then early in 2002, I had a dinner with Martin Nisenholtz and Times board member Dave Liddle and two San Francisco-based Times reporters, where I pitched them on two things: 1. Publish in RSS, and 2. Give blogs to every Times reporter. They took me up on #1 and in April we published the Times content, but not in RSS (although we were permitted to by our contract), instead using the Times‚Äôs proprietary format. Why did we do that? Well I figured that if we pubished in RSS 0.92, which was then our most advanced format, it would drag the Times into a format war and they might think it‚Äôs not worth the trouble and ask us to stop publishing their content. So I decided to ease them into the community, first publishing invisibly to the people on the mail lists, and then, once their presence was cemented, we switched over to RSS 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the loud and obnoxious fans on the mail lists shaped the story, a little. Instead of confronting their loudness, we side-stepped it. Now the Times may or may not be seen as the ‚Äútipping point‚Äù more widely, but I see it that way. Without the Times, we would have remained in disagreement, stuck in mail list hell, never achieving the promise of the technology. We all owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude, and should learn the lesson well, don‚Äôt look for leadership in standards to the netizens or to Silicon Valley, look to users who have a stake in making the technology work. Imho, that‚Äôs the key to getting things to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dsearls/status/1168543203429163009&quot;&gt;Thanks Doc&lt;/a&gt;. At this time I'm not making software to save journalism, I don't think I ever did that. I was mostly interested in tools that make people better communicators, and that of course includes journalists. Now I make tools that mostly make &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; a better communicator and a happier writer. If I had one bit of advice to journalism it would be this -- listen better. Journalism is very self-contained. At this time the answers are there, imho, with the readers and with the challenges of technology and authoritarian rulers. We can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html&quot;&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt; to save each other, but that's the key thing we're not doing -- working together.</description>

			<description>States should have to buy insurance against mass shootings, to fund health care for victims or damages to families of those killed.

			<title>My cat Nurse</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a grad student in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin&quot;&gt;Madison&lt;/a&gt; I had a cat named Nurse. I got her when I lived in NYC, between college and grad school. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got her from an ad in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice&quot;&gt;Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;, from a woman who had dozens of cats in her Manhattan apartment. She pointed out this gray cat, see how she's taking care of the sick kitten? I took her home and named her Nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later I moved to Madison, in the middle of the winter. Nurse stayed with my parents in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt; until I found a place to live, and they sent her out by airplane. She must've had a bad experience on the flight or waiting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar&quot;&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;, because when she got to me, she was freaked out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She became a tough cat, but she still was a very special cat. She'd take walks with you like a dog. And in a few weeks she was pregnant, and in a couple of months delivered a litter of five really cute (of course) newborn kittens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I lived in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://davetravel.scripting.com/2004/08/27#a36&quot;&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0683857,-89.3871709,3a,75y,160.71h,88t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sejrfHkjBYXO-p7iZodByHA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DejrfHkjBYXO-p7iZodByHA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D154.0355%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656&quot;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; nine roommates, the kittens were a huge hit. We all would watch them and poke at them and make cooing sounds until one day the kittens and Nurse were gone. Later I found them, she had camped out behind my dresser, but I didn't tell anyone where she was, I respected her wish to care for her children privately.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then in a few days -- kittens everywhere! She had let them go out in the world to find their way, and it was great. They were so much fun. A few days later, we gave them away, and Nurse went off to get fixed, and when she came back, she came back to just being Nurse, her mom days were over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've written this story before, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/12/05.html#nurse&quot;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. It came out somewhat differently, but it's basically the same story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
