			<description>This is a really &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/school-segregation-new-york.html&quot;&gt;interesting piece&lt;/a&gt; that tells the story of school desegregation in NYC, which my family took part in, in the 1960s. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/26/eveAndPeterWalkingToSchoolIn1964.png&quot;&gt;mother and little brother&lt;/a&gt; were on the front page of the NYT on Sept 14, 1964, walking from our mostly white &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;, to the paired school in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens&quot;&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;, a black neighborhood. (She was wearing a scarf and looking into the camera.) The white parents and kids walked toward the black neighborhood, the black parents and kids, walked to the school in the white neighborhood. My brother, now 60, posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/school-segregation-new-york.html?comments#permid=31244308&quot;&gt;a comment&lt;/a&gt; on the NYT story.</description>

			<description>A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17.html#a161227&quot;&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; that I have ideas for new architectures for feed reading. Here's the main idea. Users should be able to subscribe to OPML lists, not just import them. So I could use a different editor, or discovery mechanism, or who-knows-what to manage (some of) my subscription lists. Or use two different readers and have them share their lists. Having this architecture widely supported in the feed reader market would open up possibilities for higher level applications. It's a major upgrade for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; market, something a silo can't match, without ceasing to be a silo. The challenge of open networks is that they leverage their openness. This is a remarkably easy feature for feed readers to support. I've implemented it in every feed reader I've written since 2002. It never takes more than a couple of days. If you're committed to &lt;i&gt;no lock-in&lt;/i&gt; you should be all over this feature. [A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/113&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to post questions or comments.]</description>

			<description>I've been peripherally aware that some browsers and operating systems support the idea of a &lt;i&gt;feed:&lt;/i&gt; prefix for web addresses. However I don't know the history, where the idea originated, or how widely it is supported, and what are its intended semantics? When the user clicks on a link like &lt;a href=&quot;feed:http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac, what's supposed to happen? This came up in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedBase/issues/43#issuecomment-476272480&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on feedBase work.</description>

			<title>Mueller's invisible report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We. Have. Not. Seen. The. Mueller. Report.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Analogy: Youâ€™re buying a house, so you hire an inspector. But the seller says Iâ€™ll read the inspection report for you, then writes a summary that says the house doesnâ€™t have termites (even though you can see it does) and it might have a leaky roof. Of course you buy the house.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of reporters: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Those who say the Mueller Report says such and such.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Those who say Barr wonâ€™t let us read the Mueller Report.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The latter are reporting facts. The former are rewriting a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems maybe Trump found a way to fire Mueller after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>From what I hear on MSNBC, we have no idea what the Mueller report says. We only know what Barr says the report says. Reminds me of a Watergate story. Nixon didn't want to release the tapes because they would incriminate him. So he got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Stennis&quot;&gt;Democratic senator&lt;/a&gt; from the south who mostly voted Republican to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stennis_Compromise&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/a&gt; to the tapes, and he came out and said basically Nixon is right, nothing criminal here. It didn't work. The tapes ultimately were released. The more the Repubs don't want the Mueller report released, the more it says it &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be released. No one is going to give up on this.</description>

			<description>Independent of whether Congress impeaches, it would be great to have a public resource that listed all of Trump's clearly impeachable offenses, with Clinton's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton&quot;&gt;1998 impeachment&lt;/a&gt; as the benchmark.</description>

			<description>Social topology, something I've been thinking about for a long time. When I was a math student, I got interested in graph theory, and wrote all kinds of Fortran apps that walked graphs, figuring out things about them. Not a great choice of language for that. Graph theory is part of at least two branches of math, combinatorics and topology. And I think there must be a mapping from topology to the structure of online communication systems. Looked at a particular way, we've been spending the whole of my career in tech, dating back to the 70s, studying, without any sense of the theory, the topology of net communication systems. Blogs are very different from mail lists, so different the could be considered opposites. List all the different rules for each of the following: Facebook groups, Facebook messages, public Twitter, Twitter DMs, Instagram, Snapchat, AppleLink, Reddit, Whatsapp, on and on. And the tools we use for managing developer groups also yield different kinds of social topology. I was just thinking about the difference between Slack and GitHub as two recent examples of development systems I've used.</description>

			<title>Where have you gone Walter Cronkite?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn2RjahTi3M&quot;&gt;Walter Cronkite&lt;/a&gt; did an hour special &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106775685&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite#Vietnam_War&quot;&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; was unwinnable, press coverage was pretty much re-written press releases from the Pentagon. Cronkite's observation, that the war was unwinnable, turned press coverage in a different direction. The question of whether or not we should be in Vietnam was now something they could ask, and did.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're in a similar situation now. People are covering climate change and Trump as if the normal rules of journalism can deal with these two crises. Clearly they cannot. We need a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript #1: Jon Stewart was definitely on track to be the current day Walter Cronkite before he left The Daily Show. I know he disclaimed that he was just a comedian, but he was much more than that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript #2: Three observations that address the shortcomings of news in covering the current situation. If Cronkite were alive and observing the rise of Trump and our failure to address climate change, I'd like to think he'd do a corner-turn today like the one he did in 1968 around these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Occam's Razor. If it's obvious, report it as obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Common sense. Life teaches us how people are. Use that info.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is a dire situation. (Trump, climate change.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript #3: The title of this piece is derived from the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C1BCAgu2I8&quot;&gt;Mrs Robinson&lt;/a&gt; by Simon and Garfunkel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning drive notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just drove back upstate from the city, listened to two hours of NPR. They had a jerk talk nonsense about the Mueller report, about how it exonerates Trump. They just let him go on and on, never interrupting to say hey you're full of shit. Then an hour later they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Wine-Banks&quot;&gt;Jill Wine-Banks&lt;/a&gt; and she was making so much sense, but they had to cut her off mid-sentence to go to an interview with a musician. This radio listener was pissed. After so much repetitive drivel, finally someone who knows the subject, who's had some time to process, is laying it out, and they have to cut her off?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, whatever the Mueller report says or doesn't say, we all witnessed his obstruction of justice in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/i-was-going-to-fire-comey-anyway-trump-tells-lester-holt-in-interview-941538371971&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Lester Holt, and if you saw his press conference in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwxqOoIyWm0&quot;&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, you understand that Trump is controlled by Putin. We don't need a report to tell us any of that. If journalism is writing the first draft of history why aren't they writing that? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I tried listening to this morning's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/podcasts/the-daily/mueller-report-russia-investigation.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the Mueller announcement, and realized finally that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-s-schmidt&quot;&gt;their reporters&lt;/a&gt; are really dull. They don't find this stuff interesting, they just namedrop and repeat bullshit they heard somewhere as gospel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Joe Biden is going to run for president. Okay. I'm &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17/135334.html#a144043&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; in favor of it. And today there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-joe-biden-stacey-abrams-vp-54472f8f-5bb2-4d1f-bc7c-0544a09ebba5.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; that to prove he's not just some random old white guy, he's going to name his running mate long before he's even won the nomination, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17/135334.html#a141900&quot;&gt;Stacey Abrams&lt;/a&gt;, a rising star of the Democratic Party.

He paid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxL7MKsGoPo&quot;&gt;dearly&lt;/a&gt; for that choice. Biden should stand on his own and compete on equal terms with the other candidates. If he wins, so be it. If not, same thing. Going down this path he risks being overshadowed by his very interesting running mate, the way McCain was by his choice. He may say it proves he has guts, but what will it say when she outshines him?</description>

			<description>Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/podcasts/the-daily/boeing-737-max-ethiopia-crash.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; about Boeing's bug was interesting because bugs are starting to be mainstream life and death issues and the cost of lack of interop was frontmost in Boeing's decision to mask the difference in the two models of 737 using a compatibility bridge. Developer tool developers should be so concerned about the cost of re-training. Lots to process for techies. I listened to the podcast driving down the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway&quot;&gt;NYS Thruway&lt;/a&gt; in my Forester that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17.html#a035213&quot;&gt;nudges&lt;/a&gt; you to stay in your lane. I always think, what if there's a bug in this system, it might make my car do something like what the Boeing planes were doing. But I leave it on, because I like what it's doing, at least for now.</description>

Developer tool developers should be so concerned about the cost of re-training. Lots to process for techies. I listened to the podcast driving down the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway&quot;&gt;NYS Thruway&lt;/a&gt; in my Forester that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17.html#a035213&quot;&gt;nudges&lt;/a&gt; you to stay in your lane. I always think, what if there's a bug in this system, it might make my car do something like what the Boeing planes were doing. But I leave it on, because I like what it's doing, at least for now." created="Wed, 20 Mar 2019 18:39:36 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/20/tryHarder.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/03/20.html#a183936"/>

			<title>Noisy geothermal heating</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/111&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new country house has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_heat_pump&quot;&gt;geothermal heating and cooling&lt;/a&gt;, which is something I didn't know existed until I found this house. It's supposed to be a lot less expensive. It uses electricity to move water around to transfer heat from or to a pool of underground water that's at a constant temperature of 55 degrees. In the summer, it's used to cool, in the winter to heat. Genius.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But just before the heat comes on it makes a very loud jarring sound, like a garage door slamming shut. It rocks the whole house. Wakes me up when I'm sleeping. There's no preparation for it, it just happens. It's basically not acceptable. I don't want to get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've tried searching on the net for ideas about how noisy these things are supposed to be, and no one talks about this loud sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to find someone to come out and take a look, but I don't know how to search for someone who does maintenance on geothermal heating.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love the idea, but this is not an acceptable situation. I may have to switch to conventional heating and cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: An AirBnB I rented the week before had the same problem. It was worse because the heat was going on and off all the time. So it was garage door slamming all night nonstop. Needless to say I didn't stay there the full time I had reserved it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Medium keeps changing their mind about what they are. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.medium.com/medium-seeks-partners-to-launch-new-publications-6d7df0b05159&quot;&gt;Today's change&lt;/a&gt;, for me, adds to the confusion. Yet, if you think of Medium as a publishing company, as they seem to want us to, at least for now, of all the online publishing companies, they alone have structured their product around the idea of a somewhat level playing field where there isn't (much of) a distinction between professional writers and the rest of us. The big publishing and tech companies would be wise to pay attention. Even if Medium doesn't succeed, they are exploring an idea that is imho the future of news publishing.</description>

It was enabled. Oy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Luckily only one person was added this way, and it was someone I would have added anyway.

First they had interviews with victims, then quoted the prime minister about gun control and they ended with a broad trashing of the net, specifically YouTube and Facebook. But they omit a very &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=salient&quot;&gt;salient&lt;/a&gt; fact about the economics of running an open content publishing platform. You can't review each video in advance, there are too many videos and employees are too expensive. There are shades of gray, but for the NYT it's black and white. Further the reporters have a huge undisclosed conflict of interest, because the net is used for more than terrorism, it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/06/170723.html&quot;&gt;sources going direct&lt;/a&gt; to interested readers. There's a new news system trying to boot up. The same features of the net that make it possible to bootstrap a terrorism network, also enable new channels of news. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/30/salary/&quot;&gt;of course&lt;/a&gt; this is never part of their discussion. They make it sound easy. Tech is bad. Tech is responsible. Implied but not said: shut it down. They are as scary as the terrorists. Think about it.</description>

			<title>Political tiersmanship</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Tom Watson, who I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/1107297515320283136&quot;&gt;never met&lt;/a&gt;, is a fellow New Yorker whose political opinions, until recently, track my own pretty closely. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tom just &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/1107273866370523138&quot;&gt;posted his list&lt;/a&gt; of tiers of presidential candidates for 2020. I find it very provocative. Here are my comments on his list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Please, just go away Bernie&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, there's one thing we agree on. Bernie should retire. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We're saying goodbye to Hillary, even those of us who enthusiastically supported her in 2016. Sanders should step aside, following her example, as we want DJ Trump to retire, hopefully to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement&quot;&gt;solitary confinement&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermax_prison&quot;&gt;max security&lt;/a&gt; prison. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bernie is a vestige of the 2016 election, which we never will forget, but would really like to.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tom's A-tier&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't think much of any of Tom's A-tier candidates. Harris doesn't speak well, I don't have a clear idea of what she stands for. The most convincing appeal I've heard for her came from California governor Gavin Newsom on Maddow. Now &lt;i&gt;there's&lt;/i&gt; a politico who should run. He spoke highly of Harris, who he (surprisingly to Maddow) has endorsed. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Gillibrand? Don't make me laugh. She flips positions so quickly, she's just a suit, running for something, without any reason I can discern. And she was the force that drove Al Franken from the Senate, and for that, I would love to vote for anyone other than her when she runs for re-election to the Senate. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Booker? A solid meh. Like Harris and Gillibrand he says nothing other than I want to be famous. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Warren? She'd be the best president of this bunch, but she's not the purist people think she is. I believed in her before she supported Israel in their killing of innocent Gazans. At that point I realized okay she's just a Democrat who has a specialized schtick. Not a good leader. Perfect for Massachusetts, not for America. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Summary: If we elect any of these candidates, somehow (I think Trump will beat any of them) we will have wasted the election. And we'll get another Trump only worse next time. And Congress? Nothing will get done there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My A-tier&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, a note about criteria. A candidate, if you want them to win, has to be a great campaigner. Think about the poor campaigners Democrats have nominated recently and you'll see a list of losers. The winners, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, were great at owning a crowd. Think about the moments they inspired you. So Corey Booker and Kamala Harris might have great ideas, and the support of other politicians, but both are stiff and not good at thinking on their feet. And then think about the guy they're running against, he lies shamelessly and he'll say anything for a laugh. So you have to exclude otherwise good candidates who would shrivel under Trump's abuse. Think of Jeb Bush as an example. Do you really think Gillibrand would do better than Jeb?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;With that preamble, here's my A-tier: Klobuchar, Inslee, Buttigieg. They're very different candidates. I love Klobuchar because she would bring as much of the country together as is possible in 2020, and she has a strong spine, a calm demeanor and would be a good president. And she's lucky (thinking of the snowstorm in Minneapolis when she announced, who did she have to pay to make that happen). The fact that the press is gunning for her makes me like her even more. We have to think bigger picture than who best reps our personal policy preferences. Our form of government is built on compromise. You can't get everything you want, and neither can your most despised opponent. That's &lt;i&gt;good.&lt;/i&gt; We have to think about the America the next president will govern if we manage to get Trump out of office. I think Klobuchar is our best choice for that. Not Biden. Not any of the others, except... &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inslee, who I've only learned about recently, is actually the perfect candidate for our times. He has the guts to say what our top issue is, climate change, and is running on that as his only issue, and he pulls it off. A pragmatic and visionary politician who's great at leadership. Not often we get a chance to vote for such a candidate. His interview on Maddow was fantastic. Watch it if you can find it. (Their archives are awful.) He gets that politics is marketing, has ways of explaining all of it, in simple words that reach into your heart. And the great thing about it is, everything he advocates is right on, it's what we need to do. I would love to see a ticket with Inslee and Klobuchar, I don't really care who's #1 and #2. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Buttigieg is smart and inspiring, thinks on his feet, has guts and also gets that politics requires positioning, memorable slogans that reach you at an emotional level, in other words, marketing. Like Klobuchar he comes from the middle of the country which is a big plus for 2020. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I would pay money to see any of these three debate Trump (and btw, I think Biden would do pretty well there too). Tom's A-tier would deal with Trump's mischief about as well as HRC did, which is pretty good, but not good enough. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The wild card&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Stacey Abrams. Wow would she shake things up. She could either be Al Sharpton 2.0 (he was actually a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/programs/specials/democrats2004/sharpton.html&quot;&gt;candidate&lt;/a&gt;, but the press didn't take him seriously), or could come out on top. I'd pay &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of money to see her debate Trump. However there is a caveat. All the race hate that Obama inspired would re-double with a President Abrams. On the other hand, I guess this is a fight we're going to have, and I'm guessing she'd be the best to lead us. If she's running to raise her profile in advance of a Senate run in Georgia, then good for her. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's too early to worry about disruption in the field. And for sure Abrams would shake out airheads like Beto, Booker and Gillibrand. I would also pay to see them on the same debate stage. She'd mop the floor with them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All I have to say about Beto&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Beto is the Democratic equivalent of Marco Rubio. A candidate designed by central casting, with no reason to be there.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No to Joe&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Joe Biden. I met him at the DNC in 2008. He's very charismatic, one of those politicians who make you feel like you're the only person who matters. He really is a good guy. But we have to win in 2020, and putting up someone who's even older than Trump loses us an advantage we need, the idea that we're looking to the future not to the past for our best. Biden's time has passed. It seems he is going to run. I think he'll add something to the field. And he deserves a chance to convince us we're wrong when we think he needs to join HRC, Bernie, Obama and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/01/08/my-life-in-the-supermax&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; in retirement. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

I love Klobuchar because she would bring as much of the country together as is possible in 2020, and she has a strong spine, a calm demeanor and would be a good president. And she's lucky (thinking of the snowstorm in Minneapolis when she announced, who did she have to pay to make that happen). The fact that the press is gunning for her makes me like her even more. We have to think bigger picture than who best reps our personal policy preferences. Our form of government is built on compromise. You can't get everything you want, and neither can your most despised opponent. That's &lt;i&gt;good.&lt;/i&gt; We have to think about the America the next president will govern if we manage to get Trump out of office. I think Klobuchar is our best choice for that. Not Biden. Not any of the others, except..." created="Sun, 17 Mar 2019 14:05:14 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/17/amyKlobuchar.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/03/17/135334.html#a140514"/>
						<source:outline text="Inslee, who I've only learned about recently, is actually the perfect candidate for our times. He has the guts to say what our top issue is, climate change, and is running on that as his only issue, and he pulls it off. A pragmatic and visionary politician who's great at leadership. Not often we get a chance to vote for such a candidate. His interview on Maddow was fantastic. Watch it if you can find it. (Their archives are awful.) He gets that politics is marketing, has ways of explaining all of it, in simple words that reach into your heart. And the great thing about it is, everything he advocates is right on, it's what we need to do. I would love to see a ticket with Inslee and Klobuchar, I don't really care who's #1 and #2." created="Sun, 17 Mar 2019 14:07:05 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/03/17/135334.html#a140705"/>

			<title>Wires scare normal people</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of a story from Living Videotext in the 80s. We had a rule that every desk had to have a PC on it, which was somewhat radical for the 80s. That included our receptionist, Tammy, who was like my officemate, since my room was adjacent to the front entrance. We put a Toshiba desktop on the table next to her desk, and put a copy of ThinkTank on it, for notetaking, but she never used it. That was allowed too, the computer just had to be there. turned on and ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One day we got a confidential demo of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General-One&quot;&gt;new product&lt;/a&gt; from Data General, the first battery powered PC-compatible laptop. This was a huge deal. I brought groups of all the employees in to show it to them, including of course Tammy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When she saw it she said &quot;I would use that computer.&quot; I was puzzled. &quot;But Tammy that computer does exactly what your Toshiba does.&quot; She replied, but it doesn't have all those wires. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I learned something memorable there. People find computers intimidating because of all the wires. I don't blame them, I would too. That's the great thing about iPhones I guess. No wires.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: While we were testing the DG/One we were also testing the first Macintosh. Both used 3.5 inch floppy drives. But the formats weren't compatible. I tried to communicate to both companies, without violating the others' NDA that there was an opportunity to be compatible, but neither were interested. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I got my coffee and breakfast sandwich at a nearby Manhattan Starbucks today. On the way out I noticed a Michael Jackson song was playing on the store's sound system. Since this is NYC, people didn't seem to notice. I think we're going to continue to listen to him, and I think that's right. The music doesn't belong to him, even if it's his voice, because it was so important in its time, to all of us. We all remember where we were when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA&quot;&gt;Thriller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y&quot;&gt;Billie Jean&lt;/a&gt; were top hits. I was CEO of a growing software company headquartered on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/2432+Charleston+Rd,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043/@37.4229346,-122.0917818,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fba04a984cc83:0xba930085ad5d12c5!8m2!3d37.4229346!4d-122.0895931&quot;&gt;Charleston Road&lt;/a&gt; in Mountain View. I was driving a white BMW 535i with a kickass sound system that was wonderful to listen to Jackson on. I was young, the world was mine, I was creating the best stuff in the world, and he wrote the theme music. These days I don't listen to his music very much, but I did just load up the Thriller album on my iPhone to listen to on the drive I'm taking today. I expect to enjoy the feelings it brings up. I'm enjoying writing about it now.</description>

Since this is NYC, people didn't seem to notice. I think we're going to continue to listen to him, and I think that's right. The music doesn't belong to him, even if it's his voice, because it was so important in its time, to all of us. We all remember where we were when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA&quot;&gt;Thriller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y&quot;&gt;Billie Jean&lt;/a&gt; were top hits. I was CEO of a growing software company headquartered on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/2432+Charleston+Rd,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043/@37.4229346,-122.0917818,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fba04a984cc83:0xba930085ad5d12c5!8m2!3d37.4229346!4d-122.0895931&quot;&gt;Charleston Road&lt;/a&gt; in Mountain View. I was driving a white BMW 535i with a kickass sound system that was wonderful to listen to Jackson on. I was young, the world was mine, I was creating the best stuff in the world, and he wrote the theme music. These days I don't listen to his music very much, but I did just load up the Thriller album on my iPhone to listen to on the drive I'm taking today. I expect to enjoy the feelings it brings up. I'm enjoying writing about it now." created="Wed, 13 Mar 2019 12:46:04 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/13/michaelJackson.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/03/13.html#a124604"/>
