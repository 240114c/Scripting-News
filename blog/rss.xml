			<description>Why are we impeaching the president, big picture. Our system has gone off the rails, we've got a monarch in the White House. This impeachment is the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution&quot;&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and has the same goal as the first, to depose a king. And again, we have to change the rules so it won't happen again.</description>

			<description>An idea. If &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontpagelive.com/2019/10/05/impeachment-or-lost-election-what-if-trump-just-refuses-to-leave/&quot;&gt;Trump refuses to leave&lt;/a&gt; the White House, change its name to Federal Penitentiary #248, place guards at all doors, no one goes in or out. No Internet access, no food. The constitutional president governs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Guest_House&quot;&gt;Blair House&lt;/a&gt;. Trump comes out or dies there. Either way, eventually the White House is torn down, as a symbol of the imperial presidency. From now on the president &lt;i&gt;strictly&lt;/i&gt; follows the Constitution, no more undeclared wars, Congress appropriates the money. Impeachment hearings start immediately after the Inauguration, and at the first sign of the breach of the Constitution, the president is impeached and removed. It's not going to be a glamorous job in the future. We're getting rid of our second king, and we must make sure no usurper like Trump can turn the office of President into an authoritarian pulpit. Burning the White House to the ground serves as a symbol of that transition.</description>

			<description>Trump isn‚Äôt playing multidimensional chess, and neither is Putin. His goal was to reduce the US to chaos. Our elections are now meaningless. Mass killings by people with automatic weapons. No sense of normalcy. The news people are focused on impeachment, but since just after the 2016 election have buried the big story. The US has been defeated. We're occupied. We live in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_France&quot;&gt;Vichy&lt;/a&gt; America. The president is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17576956/transcript-putin-trump-russia-helsinki-press-conference&quot;&gt;Russian asset&lt;/a&gt;. It's all out in the open, but until the whistleblower, no one, not Mueller, not the Repubs in Congress, not the Dems in Congress, nor the Dems running for president, have had the guts to say the truth out loud. We all hope someone else will take the risk. We have to fight to get out of this. It's going to be bloody. But the longer we wait the worse it'll be.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1179810620952207362&quot;&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt;, presidential candidate, wants Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's Twitter account. My two cents. This is what‚Äôs wrong with today‚Äôs net, that it‚Äôs up to one unelected unaccountable tech exec to decide if the elected president has a voice. Twitter has too much power. They endow people they like with millions of followers, and delete accounts for friends. No one has to listen to Trump. I‚Äôve had him blocked for years.</description>

			<description>There's no excuse for congresspeople to use Medium. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/10319&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from Speaker Pelosi. Look at the URL. It looks way better than anything on Medium, and it has the advantage that it will remain on the web even if Medium shuts down.</description>

I'm thinking about ways to re-open the blog to interaction, but have it be as convenient as possible for the reader/contributors.

			<description>The reporting on Ukraine misses an important point. Not only was Trump putting the squeeze on Ukraine to become part of his mob, he was also selling them out. A small relatively powerless country that depended on our protection, Trump was stepping back and letting Russia roll over them.</description>

			<description>WIth &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/07.html&quot;&gt;Big 25&lt;/a&gt; coming up, it's great to hear from people who were reading in the early years. For example, David Boroditsky checked in yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/boroditsky/status/1179081346943078400&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. He sent a link to an email he sent me, which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/stories/DavidBoroditsky.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; to the blog, in Oct 1996, two years after the start. He talks about the non-web features of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I forget that Frontier and the blog were two sides of the same coin in the early days. All the early blogging and RSS software ran in Frontier.</description>
