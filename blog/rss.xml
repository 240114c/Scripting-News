			<description>I am far from being a billionaire. But I've made good money selling software, real estate and I just inherited a bit of money from my parents. This is what I have to say. I was always amazed at how little I paid in taxes on each of the major events.</description>

			<description>I'm working my way through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;, starting with season 1 so I can watch the final season without being horribly confused. But all of a sudden there's the final season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Man in the High Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Oy. And the third season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Everywhere I've lived people greet outsiders mostly generously but there are always some who don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've moved so much geographically and in what I do, over my 64 years, I have a lot of experience with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley welcomed me in 1979. The people who lived there before the various booms were farmers. Lots or orchards. Small towns, it looked like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)&quot;&gt;Central Valley&lt;/a&gt; in Calif today. My family drove through there when I was ten years old and I remember it. In the first 20 years I was there, I felt like I had come home. Everyone was into the same things I was, personal computers, software designed for humans, and it was all so new, so much potential, so much to explore. But it already looked like Long Island. And traffic like you wouldn't believe got worse every year. Was it ruined by newcomers? Hard to say. Maybe it achieved its destiny. I left in 2003 because I more or less hated what it had become. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;While I was there, I got involved peripherally with Napster when it was booming. I was fascinated. My blog was well-read in tech, so I got to know a lot of music people in that period, not always in a friendly way. Ultimately I think they would have done better if they listened and accepted that change was inevitable, and they could profit from it. People were actively interested in music in ways I had never seen. But the insiders desperately didn't want it to change. Is it better that now we can all program our own music? I feel very strongly -- yes. It's hard to imagine that when I grew up I was limited to what was played on the radio and what I could afford to buy. There was so much more music. And music is so personal. All that potential opened up as Napster broke the dam. It was incredible for the users. The people who make and sell music didn't appreciate that or respect that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My own family are immigrants. My parents and grandparents landed in Queens and Brooklyn as refugees during WWII, running for their lives from the Nazis. We were not universally welcomed. Lots of antisemitism. I grew up ashamed of my heritage, because I took on the attitudes people had about us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A funny thing happened, as my mother was getting old. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; she had lived in since the 1960s was turning from Irish, Italian with a little Jewish, to Asian -- Chinese and Korean. And my mom, born in Prague, an American newbie, was angry about the changes that were coming. I was amazed to see this, because she was a very inclusive sort of person, welcoming, and sought out different experiences. And of course she had herself benefited from a country that had its doors open to anyone. When she died, and it came time to sell the house, the neighbors next door begged us not to sell to an Asian family. They were also refugees. I said nothing but I thought it was both futile and hypocritical. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I guess if I lived anywhere for long enough to resent newbies it would be on the net. I started using it as a grad student in the 70s. I've been through every iteration, and yes -- there's a point at which the area you've learned to call home becomes overrun with newbies. They have no idea about the culture you've developed, and they don't seem to care. They do the equivalent of leaving broken glass and dirty diapers at our pristine swimming holes. It sucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook is, to me, the Land of the Newbies, the way AOL was 30 years ago. But I love FB the community (I do not love FB the company, though I know a number of people who work there, some of whom I consider lifetime friends). I especially love the Woodstock group, because it's filled with love, and I've benefited so much from it. I'm not kidding. 99.99 percent of my interactions there over the last year or so have been lovely. And I've learned so much about the place I now call home, far more than I could have without the group. It's changed the way I think about local news. Friends who work in journalism don't understand the role FB groups play, and they're not listening any better than the music industry people did in Napster days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have friends who remember the net before FB as I do who will not use FB. They say they got along fine without it before, and will be fine now. No doubt. But they're missing something huge and cultural, and eventually the software they make will be irrelevant because they failed to move where the culture was going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Humans dealing with change. A constant. We don't always do it well. God bless  our pointy heads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1080195318854539&quot;&gt;cross-posted&lt;/a&gt; this on FB because it's so much about FB.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm glad that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Carmelo Anthony&lt;/a&gt; is getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2019/11/carmelo-anthony-signs-with-portland-trail-blazers-on-1-year-deal-report.html&quot;&gt;another chance&lt;/a&gt;. He was the face of the Knicks for many years. I was surprised to find that even though his attitude about himself and the team was the source of a lot of the Knicks' problems, after he was gone, I felt affection for him. I look forward to seeing him play for Portland and I hope the team and the fans give him a chance to get settled in. He's more than a player, he's part of the soul of the NBA. There's no doubt when he returns to the Garden with his new team, there will be a huge outpouring of affection for him.</description>

			<title>Russia, Russia Ã¼ber alles</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show&quot;&gt;Maddow&lt;/a&gt; last night, it would be hard to call the first day of testimony in the impeachment hearings a snoozefest. Here's the deal. Everything the president does not only benefits him personally but it also benefits Russia. All of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So more than an impeachment, we are hearing a case study about how the Republican Party and the American president are servants of a foreign adversary. A truth most of us find hard to accept, I guess. But there's a lot more of this than has come to light. This is just the first that has been so microscopically exposed. Expect that when we peer into the Turkish invasion of Kurdistan, we will find another clusterfuck of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot;&gt;your favorite country&lt;/a&gt; and mine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need more than impeach and remove.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism&quot;&gt;exorcism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Can you imagine what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr&quot;&gt;AG Barr&lt;/a&gt; must think. It was his skill at hype that dug Trump out of the jam he was in with Mueller. What a gift. That was just Act One. Next would be the indictments for Justice people who started the Mueller investigation, to set an example for the people who remain. Either be loyal to Trump or get out. He probably figured he'd have DoJ and the spy agencies cleaned out by the end of next year. Then, after winning re-election, something Barr couldn't help with, they would be ready for Act Three, replete with goose-stepping storm troopers and gas chambers for people of color and non-Christians. Seems obvious that Trump and Barr's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander/status/1195088750306635785&quot;&gt;animated conversation&lt;/a&gt; was about Barr resigning. The Trump Train isn't going where he thought it was, and if Barr stays on board, he's probably going to jail. His bet was a long shot, and now it's impossibly long. Trump may survive impeachment, but he's not likely to become the American Hitler.</description>

That imho is a much better idea than hiring reporters, as he did in the first instance of WT.

			<description>How sad for our country that yesterday's impeachment hearings were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/plenty-substance-little-drama-first-day-impeachment-hearings-n1081926&quot;&gt;judged&lt;/a&gt; by American journalism as lacking in entertainment value. A good journalist could have found plenty to write about that was gripping from many perspectives. It went to the heart of the United States' role in the world. We identify with the people of Ukraine who are struggling to create a civil system like the one we used to have in the US. They were making progress, &lt;i&gt;with our help,&lt;/i&gt; at fighting corruption. Two examples of American goodness testified. And the role of Trump and his mob was to bring American corruption to them. It couldn't be uglier. Maybe it lacked pizzazz if you have no sense of pride in America. I don't know why we place such a high value on journalism, when they fight against us with lunacy like this.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1194671109679046658&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt;, with Erdogan next to him, on Syria: &quot;We are keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil.&quot; Someone in the military must have told him, many times, how this puts at risk all US military everywhere, basically forever. I don't buy that Trump is an idiot who has no idea what he's doing. Also it's a joke that we would be trying to acquire (or steal) more carbon-based energy. We should be putting carbon in the ground, not taking it out.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://protocol.com/&quot;&gt;Protocol&lt;/a&gt; is a new tech pub from the publisher of Politico. Launching in early 2020. They announced it in a Vanity Fair &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/politico-founder-is-launching-a-tech-site&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; (paywall, lots of noisy dialogs). I'm in tech, have been reading tech pubs for almost 40 years. It's been a long time since one was worth reading, sad to say. But wouldn't it be cool if this one was different? They have a great web address. Why not start out with a blog about the creation of the pub, and when they're up and running it could transition to their &quot;public editor&quot; function. Take criticism from readers, new perspectives. I know it's weird but I expect tech pubs to make good use of the tech. I'd also like to know who's writing for them, the Vanity Fair piece doesn't have that info.</description>

			<description>The hearing today is going to set the tone for further reporting on impeachment. At least it affords the Democrats the chance to do that. Hopefully they rise to the occasion.</description>

			<description>Just tuned into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe&quot;&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; for their pre-discussion of the hearings. Oh the epic vacuousness of their diatribe. After an insipid idea is completely exhausted, they repeat it.  Once I finished vomiting in the waste basket, I decided I had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1194610096560582658&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about it. Done.</description>

			<description>My vision of the Republican Party is death. There is no redemption. They went over the cliff a long time ago. What remains is cancer. You don't try to rehabilitate cancer, you cut it out and destroy what remains. That's why the new version of the Democrats must piss everyone off equally. No one philosophy matters, at this time, other than adherence to the Constitution.</description>

			<description>The conclusion from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/10.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; political &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1193904968014729216&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; is this. Electing a Democratic president in a squeaker is not a win. It leaves the Republican Party alive with a huge electorate that the Democrats could not convert. It they can't do it now, then we'll never get out of gridlock. We're spinning down. We almost defaulted on the national debt. We're not renewing our physical or human infrastructure. Our treasury is easily looted by the rich. The Repubs will win the next election, and the cycle repeats. Squeaking out a win is not winning. The US will continue to decline, as will the planet's health, if we continue on the track we're on. We need a revolution, a fundamental reconfiguration of our political sysem so we can tackle the actual problems we have, not made-up ones. The kind of revolution the founders allowed for in the Constitution.</description>

			<description>So much great TV coming out in the weeks ahead. I might not get any work done. Right now I'm going through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt; a second time, slowly. It's worth doing, because now the things Elliot says to the audience make sense. After the big reveal on Mr Robot, he looks at the camera and asks &quot;Did you know?&quot; I laughed and said damn right I knew. It's interesting in a different way when you know what's real and what's not.</description>

Right now I'm going through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt; a second time, slowly. It's worth doing, because now the things Elliot says to the audience make sense. After the big reveal on Mr Robot, he looks at the camera and asks &quot;Did you know?&quot; I laughed and said damn right I knew. It's interesting in a different way when you know what's real and what's not." created="Sun, 10 Nov 2019 13:58:41 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/10/fsociety.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/11/10.html#a135841"/>

			<description>Itâ€™s kind of scary how attached some people are getting to Their Candidate. Remember: 1. Most of them will lose. 2. Your favorite will probably lose. 3. Weâ€™re all going to support the Dem nominee, no matter how much they suck.</description>

			<title>A new two-party configuration</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TL;DR: There are a lot of winnable votes in the 40 percent who are likely to vote for Trump.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some elections reconfigure the balance between the two parties. Like Nixon, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy&quot;&gt;southern strategy&lt;/a&gt; flipped the south from Dem to Repub. He saw an opportunity, took it, it worked, was transformational, and that reconfiguration is still in place 50 years later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well never imho has the country needed to reconfigure the balance between the parties more than it does now. The Repubs are being driven to fascism. That's usually a fringe thing in the US, but now is on its way to becoming mainstream. That is if you believe Trump's &quot;base&quot; is fascist. I for one don't think they are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they hate liberal elites who think they know everything, but they think (in the flyover states) that they understand nothing about America. That's a complicated idea, and would take a lot of tweets to explain, but there's something real there. The America they grew up believing in, that many of us did, never was what they said it was, but it's still their core idea of America, and we've drifted very far from it. In their minds America is white, Christian, there's a mom and a dad and kids, and Thanksgiving, guns and self-sufficiency. This America doesn't have any problems. It kicks ass. It rules the world. And the white people dominate (a nice way of saying what it does to PoC's).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The basic grievance they have is this. Look at all the great things they're doing for &quot;others&quot; and I'm not getting any help at all. Take care of me first, and let the other guys pull themselves up like I did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They feel the way they feel. And you probably have a lot of hypocrisy and lies in your own view of the world, btw. I know the family I grew up in did. Some day I'll write a piece about all the lies they clung to. It'll be a long piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to Trump's 40 percent. I'm not taling about all of them. Some for sure are real goose-stepping Jew-hating Nazis. But a lot of them just want to hear from a president &quot;I got your back,&quot; and then enumerate their fears, so they know you hear them. Even if their fears are off the wall. You can say you hear them without selling your soul, or selling out the former Democratic Party base. And that's how the center-left party can emerge. It'll be called the Democratic Party, but it'll have a lot of until-recently Republicans in it. Nothing wrong with that. The Republicans used to have liberals. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because the real important split in the US is between people who believe in the Constitution and those who don't. That's so basic. And now in 2019, it's peak season for converting rule-of-law Republicans to lifetime Democratic Party voters. And where the parents go, the kids are likely to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what's more important? A failed push for Medicare For All by President Warren or Sanders, or a new permanent political reality in the US that solves problems for 50 years led by President Bloomberg, Inslee or Klobuchar? I actually like Bloomberg because he mastered the sensibilities of business management, and has had three terms as NYC mayor to convert that sensibility to politics and governance. He's shovel ready, in other words. More than any of the others including Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said at the beginning, this is a time when we could reconfigure the two-party system. There are a lot of winnable votes in the 40 percent who will vote for Trump if we nominate a Warren or Sanders. And if those votes plus minorities, city people and suburbanites could compromise, we could have a big enough majority to fix a lot of things. Things that most Trump voters want. Like to be sure of their health care. More jobs. Spending more money on domestic stuff as opposed to unwinnable forever wars. What they want, in a word, is security. These are all natural Democratic issues, and somehow via lies and Democratic lunacy the Repubs have been able to at least partially usurp them. That's because the Dems don't claim them. They get lost in the weeds talking about health benefits for non-citizens and taking away people's health insurance which for crying out loud is not even what the Dems are contemplating.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/11/08/777511592/read-testimony-of-fiona-hill-ex-white-house-russia-policy-official&quot;&gt;Fiona Hill's testimony&lt;/a&gt; last night, she's saying something similar about the political system in the US. We're smart, we know how to do big things. There are a lot of good people in the United States ready to kick ass. If you can just get the poltiical stuff under control, America will resume the greatness that it never lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
