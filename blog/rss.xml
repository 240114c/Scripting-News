			<description>The only football team I've ever been a fan of, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers&quot;&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;, is in tonight's SuperBowl. I'm angry and frustrated that the NFL won't hire former Niners quarterback &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick&quot;&gt;Colin Kaepernick&lt;/a&gt;. I also remember the intellect, wisdom, character, professionalism, talent and luck of the Niners of the 80s and 90s. So just for tonight, I'll be a football fan again. Go Niners! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üèà&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, to tech-savvy users who are regulars here. Please pitch in and help test the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/01.html#a174348&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub, the problems tend to be technical, though the typical user of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cribsheet.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; is not. If you've looked for a way to pitch in, this is where I need the most help. Keep an outline on &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. When there's a new release try editing it. Do the changes stick when you reload the page? Try creating a new outline. Open an existing one. Log off and log on. Go through the menus and try all the commands. We're looking for breakage, something that used to work but because of changes doesn't work now. A lot of stuff changed in this release. But most of it isn't visible to users. Help me out. This is foundational work. I need LO2 to work for people, smoothly. Thanks.</description>

			<description>Trump is picking a fight with Michael Bloomberg, re his height. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ginasmith888/status/1224037007673815040&quot;&gt;Gina Smith&lt;/a&gt; points out that Bloomberg is an inch taller than Putin. Heh. And then I read that Bloomberg's spokesperson, Julie Wood (a woman, this is important) said this: &quot;The president is lying. He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity, and his spray-on tan.&quot;  You know, this is the first time in four years Trump has been in presidential politics, talking about people's bodies and demeanor, that someone has come back at him with this line of attack, which is totally valid. When you're being bullied by someone so obviously vulnerable, give it back to him. It's even &lt;s&gt;worse&lt;/s&gt; better when a woman says a man is a liar, bald, fat, and wears makeup. Trust me on that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

If it's up to the voters, can we have the information we need to make a decision. Bolton's testimony is vital. As is the documentary evidence.

			<title>Bojack finale, initial thoughts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Quick thoughts on the finale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6&quot;&gt;Bojack&lt;/a&gt;. Spoilers follow. I think they planned the second-to-last episode as the actual final episode. Had they done that I would have said who ever thought a comedy like Bojack Horseman would try something so ambitious, and even better, pull it off. But they added one more plot twist, it's really hard to parse, and the rest of the final episode is weird and repetitive, and at the end punts the ending. Still a groundbreaking show that's often LOL funny. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/whyYouMustWatchBojackHorseman.html&quot;&gt;wish&lt;/a&gt; all my friends would watch it so we can talk about it. Now I'll take some time and read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am gradually switching off Dropbox, and wrote a piece of software called &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicfolder.io/&quot;&gt;Public Folder&lt;/a&gt; to sync with Amazon S3. Despite its name it works for private stuff too. I use it for all my this.how docs and a few other projects. Works great.</description>

			<description>When I read an article about online &quot;bernie bros&quot; -- I wonder if the author remembers not to trust the intent of people who tweet at them. We learned this in 2016. Trolls try to divide us, they enflame both sides. I would never trust a &quot;bernie bro&quot; to be an actual person.</description>

			<title>What about the courts?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering how the courts will incorporate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump&quot;&gt;Senate's decision&lt;/a&gt; into their interpretation of the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Will they judge the executive as if the president is a monarch now?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They can't overrule the Senate, that seems clear from the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another question. What will the Repubs in the Senate do if/when Trump pushes the boundaries. For example, suppose he has a journalist killed. Lots of witnesses. He admits it. Assuming the House impeaches him, what does the Senate do? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A less radical hypothetical. What if he arrests Hillary Clinton for interfering with his re-election. Seems likely that will go to court. Say the Supreme Court rules this is illegal or unconstitutional. Will Trump respect that even though the Senate appears to have said it's OK.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagine the scholars and judges are thinking about this now. This has been a precedent-setting trial. If they actually do acquit him when no one contests the truth, it appears the only part of the government that objects is the House. It seems the question will be raised in the courts as well. It'll appear on Roberts' desk before too long. Is the president really a king?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
