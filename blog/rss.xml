			<description>There should be a service that sends you the daily archive of my blog automatically via email the next morning. It should be totally turnkey. I would have nothing to do with it. It's a simple RSS application. Okay stupid question -- does such an application exist?</description>

			<description>The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos_(season_3)&quot;&gt;Narcos season&lt;/a&gt; set in Mexico is terrible. Everything about it is awful. I kept watching because I wanted to understand how they could make something so bad. I think what they did is write down the arc of the various threads in the previous two seasons, and they just repeated the story with different characters. They have these idiotic conversations about characters you know nothing about and don't care about. Even the star, the new Pablo Escobar is a flat character. His old fat sidekick is terrible. I understood him in the first few scenes he appeared in, but then he became this crazy guy. The beauty of Narcos in previous seasons is that you could get into the head of Pablo Escobar and it made sense. You felt for him and each of the people around him, even though he was a monster. In the end of Season 3 there is one scene where the two main characters meet each other for the first and last time. That one scene was good. There was some truth in it. But otherwise it was a big fucking meh. So what. Even their stories about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maximumyield.com/definition/4378/sensimilla&quot;&gt;sensimilla&lt;/a&gt; works were wrong. Couldn't they read the Wikipedia page and do a little fact checking? It's actually interesting science.</description>

			<description>Had a great phone talk last night with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Udell&quot;&gt;Jon Udell&lt;/a&gt;. We've known each other for a long time. We went to the same conferences in the early days of the web. I read everything he wrote in his BYTE and Infoworld columns, which were the best. He's a clear thinker, super smart, and feels the web the same way I do. He's also a prodigous &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jonudell.net/&quot;&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt;. If you follow me here on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, you should add Jon's &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jonudell.net/feed/&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; to your reader. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Jon just posted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jonudell.net/2018/11/25/the-reengineering-of-three-california-lakes/&quot;&gt;excellent piece&lt;/a&gt; about the Salton Sea, Owens Valley and Mono Lake in California. As a longtime California resident, I've always been interested in how water is managed in the west, whose major cities have no water of their own. That's what happened to the water flowing off the eastern face of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)&quot;&gt;Sierras&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I recently switched from an iPhone 6S to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-Fully-Unlocked/dp/B07HCTCMT7&quot;&gt;iPhone XS Max&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way it never occurred to me that I was giving up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90270691/i-still-miss-my-headphone-jack-and-i-want-it-back&quot;&gt;headphone jack&lt;/a&gt;. The 6S has one the XS does not. I guess it's less of an issue to me now because in 2018 it seems Bluetooth works reliably. Previous iPhones, headphones and speakers would lose their pairing regularly. This got super annoying when I'm out riding my bike, it means stopping and fiddling around with the phone while I really want to be moving. Eventually I gave up on Bluetooth for that application and went to a hard wire connection. The speakers all still have the headphone jack. Now I guess I'm entering a new frontier. But I still have my iPhone 6S in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/26/junkDrawer.png&quot;&gt;right top drawer&lt;/a&gt; of my desk along with all the other obsolete hardware I couldn't manage to actually throw away. BTW, I love the XS. Not sure exactly why, but I do. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Sorry this isn't capitalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's where capitalism, such as it is, becomes ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people have enough money to pay for lavish lifestyles for themselves and generations of their offspring, what do they want? Orders of magnitude more money.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Fuck the earth, fuck everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I say &quot;such as it is&quot; because capitalism is an idea not reality. It can only exist when there's so much space between people they can't pool resources and don't need cops and courts to keep them from killing each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when technology is so backward that they can't create medicine or machines. After that it ain't capitalism anymore. It's a mess, a glorious human mess, that if left to grind it's way to completion leaves a dead planet in its wake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>People who say they know what Facebook should do. How could they. Nothing like it has ever existed. It’s a miracle that it works at all. This is what I think when critics profess to know what’s wrong and how to fix it.</description>

			<description>I waited for a weekend to try this experiment. I wanted to see what would happen if I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/24/deletedFiles.png&quot;&gt;nuked&lt;/a&gt; the data folder on my main &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river5&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt; installation. So that's what I did today. You'll see the effect anywhere one of my rivers appears. For example, this is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/24/podcatchHomePage.png&quot;&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt; right now. Hopefully that will change when the next podcast shows up, and by Monday there should be a full complement.</description>

			<description>An idea for a New Year's resolution. At least once a day agree with someone. Not silently. Say &quot;I agree with you.&quot; No qualification, not &quot;I agree with you, but..&quot; It's jarring at first, then liberating. And the responses will surprise you.</description>

			<description>There's a new element, &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1542988644000&quot;&gt;source:likes&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; namespace. It appears in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for Scripting News. Feed readers can use the server URL to form a Like icon for each item that integrates with other feed readers. Perhaps the beginning of a way to build connections between people who read a blog via various feed readers. Updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/blob/master/readme.md&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for my Likes server to include a third &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes#api-for-the-node-app&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; endpoint. I'm probably going to support this in River5 to complete the circle.</description>

			<title>Klobuchar for America</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; would be a great candidate for president in 2020. Her competence, coolness and good manners say everything I as an American would like to say to the world. She's young, but not too young. A liberal who presents as a moderate. Thoughtful. Doesn't shoot from the hip.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything the current president is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is who we &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If she wins, my pick for Attorney General would be Stacey Abrams. Like Sessions, from the South, but the South of today, not the south of the 1940s. Let's use the Democratic majorities to pass some strong updates to the Voting Rights Act, as a first priority. No more of the funny bullshit the Repubs have been doing to game the system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Labor -- Sherrod Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State -- John Kerry of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Defense -- Jim Mattis (a Dem tradition started by Obama).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Speaker of the House -- Nancy Pelosi, if she'll have us. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dave's adventure in Crapola land</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1066024770762928129&quot;&gt;Woe is me&lt;/a&gt;. NPM won't see my new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daverss&quot;&gt;daverss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today's project is adding a link to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://likes.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Likes server&lt;/a&gt; to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. That way feed readers if they were so inclined, could hook up all the readers of my blog to my Likes system. We'd have a nice little network for Liking stuff &lt;i&gt;without Facebook&lt;/i&gt; in the middle. I find this is a very nice soft way of finding out who's reading my blog. Everyone is opt-in on everything. People want this from their blogs (Dries &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dries/status/1065592741458075650&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; this yesterday) and everyone with a podcast wants to know who listened. The thing is to make it easy for people to share that bit of info, rather than extracting it without permission. It's the web way of doing tracking. I love this. Now if NPM would just &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1066024770762928129&quot;&gt;get out&lt;/a&gt; of the way. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I figured out what to do. I just copied the right file into the right spot in node_modules and voila it works. What a fucking egregious hack. The best kind. If NPM had worked as it was supposed to this is one of those IWTFT situations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;IWTFT is an acronym for It Worked The First Time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A couple of changes to how Likes work &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 1. On new posts, Likes are on by default. I can still turn them off on each post. 2. Instead of saying &quot;8 Likes&quot; it now just says 8. It's easier on the eyes, and maybe it's just a ping and not necessarily a like. We will still call them likes.</description>

			<description>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcbrowserclient/&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of a client that runs the standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; test suite from the late 90s. In theory if an implementation passed the test 18 years ago, it should still pass it today. Consider this a ping asking the question Are You There? If you use or maintain an implementation of XML-RPC, please try the test and report the result in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/7&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;. From this we'll start to rebuilt the XML-RPC clients list, showing only ones that are known to be alive.</description>

			<description>Tis the season to binge-watch. I started out with a depressing watch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_a_Murderer&quot;&gt;Making a Murderer&lt;/a&gt;, season 2. (Small spoilers ahead.) It was a real slog. I kept watching because I wanted to know what happens, and I didn't want to find out by reading about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=steven+avery+brendan+dassey&amp;t=h_&amp;iar=news&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;on the net&lt;/a&gt;. It's very depressing, even more so than season 1. And complicated. After a while I started tuning out the complications, figuring they were telling the truth and that if it became significant, they would explain it all again. And the tedious interviews with the parents of the two prisoners. I thought maybe one of them would die? Spoiler: Not much happened. The best part was Avery's new attorney, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Kathleen+Zellner&amp;t=h_&amp;iar=news&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;Kathleen Zellner&lt;/a&gt;. I find her very interesting, smart, and if they did a show just about her I'd probably watch. I think the two families are permanently fucked and my opinion of the State of Wisconsin, which used to be very high (I went to UW-Madison, loved it) is now pretty low.</description>

			<description>So my back hurts, I just slogged through a depressing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/20.html#a135741&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;. It's cold and dreary in NYC. I hear about the new Coen Brothers movie, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Buster_Scruggs&quot;&gt;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80200267&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, and it's getting good reviews from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/movies/the-ballad-of-buster-scruggs-review.html&quot;&gt;AO Scott&lt;/a&gt; and a friend who knows me well. So I sit down to watch. It's weird, episodic, but a movie not a series. I had heard the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers&quot;&gt;Coens&lt;/a&gt; were working on a series. The first segment was funny, I actually lol'd a few times. The second was okay, but the third sent me in a tailspin of depression. Oh no this is not what I had in mind. I was hoping for Fargo or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski&quot;&gt;Lebowski&lt;/a&gt;, but this makes No Country look like a fun dramedy. A few hours later I picked it up again, and it got better, way better. The segments were very Coen-ish, both funny and tragic. You know. Like the end of even the funniest Coen-y movies. I say go ahead and watch it, but if it's bumming you out, realize that's not all it's doing. The whole thing is a massive joke, on you.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I can say &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/what-happened-to-carmelo-anthony.html&quot;&gt;what happened&lt;/a&gt; to Melo.

Gave him a player who was &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=ecstatic&quot;&gt;glad&lt;/a&gt; to be in the NBA, who would mold his game to make Melo the star that he was always capable of being. Melo didn't want anyone else in the spotlight. Goodbye Lin. Just imagine what the three guys in &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/02/25/meloLin.gif&quot;&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; could have done.

			<description>I was searching for a story about friendship, about my friend Bodie who I was mouthing off to about a girlfriend, Kim, who was frustrating to me. I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/whatIsFriendship&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; it on a test site I was keeping at Berkman, a site that has since been deleted by them. However I moved it to my own server before they did that. Google indexed it, thankfully, and now I have a record of what I was thinking about that day. The piece was a remembrance of my uncle, Ken Kiesler, aka The Great VaVaVoom, or Uncle Vava. I can go right back there, to a day 15 years ago, the day after he died, suddenly, far away in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negril&quot;&gt;Negril&lt;/a&gt;. That's how long it has been. His memory has faded for me. I haven't talked with him since then, I was beginning to live the part of my life where I never talk to him, but that day in 2003 his memory was still fresh. This is what blogging is for. I want these memories. I want the ability to tell my future self who I am today.</description>

			<description>Little known fact. My uncle was one of the first bloggers. Along with Dan Gillmor at the SJ Mercury-News, they were the first users of &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;. Ken had little idea that he was doing something new. That, to me, was a sign that we had hit the sweet spot. The little programming experience he had was as a college student in the early 60s at Carnegie-Mellon. This of course was very different. He wrote his blog from an internet cafe in Negril. I've kept &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; running all these years. Proud of it.</description>

			<description>So what does a &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; mean &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/17.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News? It's a way to tell me that you saw what I wrote and found it likeable. It doesn't mean you necessarily agree. You're also registering your presence to other people who read this blog. Maybe it's more like a ping? Hmmm. I know the Like icon doesn't show up in your feed reader (maybe that can change) but it may be worth a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; if you want to say hi to me and others who read this blog. That's what it means.</description>

			<source:outline text="So what does a &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; mean &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/17.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News? It's a way to tell me that you saw what I wrote and found it likeable. It doesn't mean you necessarily agree. You're also registering your presence to other people who read this blog. Maybe it's more like a ping? Hmmm. I know the Like icon doesn't show up in your feed reader (maybe that can change) but it may be worth a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; if you want to say hi to me and others who read this blog. That's what it means." created="Sat, 17 Nov 2018 20:02:27 GMT" type="outline" fllikeable="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/11/17.html#a200227"/>

Today imho, that's where journalism is at. It's not hard to do, but it's going to make journalism more competitive which is a good thing! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I am no longer watching TV coverage of Trump. That means no more MSNBC. When Mueller indicts or Congress investigates, or if he resigns,  I'll be happy to watch. But I don't need any more on the depravity of El Orange. I know it all. And btw, so do you.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes&quot;&gt;Likes&lt;/a&gt; is a Node-based server that manages an SQL database of triplets: username, URL of the thing they liked, and a timestamp. When you like something, it adds a record to the database. When you unlike, the record is removed. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/client/&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt; that shows how to hook up to the server in your own web apps. I've factored the code so there's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/browser/api&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/browser&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/a&gt;. You probably will only use the API in your stuff. We use Twitter for identity. If you want to run your own server, which is fine with me, you will need to create an app on &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Questions are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/issues/1&quot;&gt;welcome&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I was having an offline discussion with a famous journalist. He objected to me making general statements about journalism. But to me journalism is often, in some ways, a monolith. Yes I know some writers are better than others. And I know all tech isn't the same (his counter-example), but I also understand that as a user, I see tech companies acting in concert. I see limits they impose to give themselves power that I can't have. Same in journalism. So it's totally valid to write about journalism as an entity, because in some ways, for me, that's how I experience it. As with all writing, I only write about my experience.</description>

			<description>It would be great to have one writing system for the web that blow by all the limits imposed by the journalism and tech. No character limit. Full use of HTML. Titles, podcasts. RSS feeds in and out, so it's not a silo.</description>
