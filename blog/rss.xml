			<description>One candidate could change everything by raising money to do good things for Americans right now, not after they get elected. The idea that value was flowing to the people not the owners of the media companies would inspire voters. It would inspire me. This would be bigger imho than Sanders and Warren not taking corporate donations. I think we'd welcome big corporate donations, as long as the money was flowing in a good way.</description>

			<description>What I want most for Christmas is to do a final build of the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC site&lt;/a&gt; as a static Manila site, so the 1998 version that's about to be retired is safely preserved for the future. The problem is outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/141&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I could have answered the question myself, in 2002. Any help from an old school Frontier developer would be much appreciated. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Speaking of which there should be a place I can download a final release of Frontier from 2004 or so, with Manila baked in, and its full web interface. If I replaced the app, I could probably run it on a Mac running Mojave or a Windows machine (I should get one that can run Frontier before they stop making them).</description>

			<title>A chicken or an egg?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something cute I did a few days ago. I wondered, if Twitter could handle the full text of blog posts as I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/17/151033.html&quot;&gt;advocating&lt;/a&gt;, how could it work. I came up with an approach, and implemented my side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the source of a recent post here, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/24/164526.html&quot;&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; you're reading right now, you'll &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/theMeta.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; a &quot;twitter:body&quot; meta element in the header. Its content attribute is a base64-encoded markdown version of the post. There's a minimal amount of HTML in the post for basic features that markdown can't do. It's something Twitter could experiment with right now, if there's a developer there who thinks this is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Of course this data is there for any other curious developer who wants to play with the idea. That's kind of how RSS got bootstrapped between 1997 and 1999. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Wanting to want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid I had so many material desires, so many things that cost money that wouldâ€™ve given me pleasure. Mostly stereo and sports equipment. I didnâ€™t have any money. Now I could buy anything that I want. But thereâ€™s nothing money can buy that I want.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As has been pointed out elsewhere there are exceptions to this rule. I want a hot tub. For whatever reason I can't seem to get the things I need together to get it installed. When I get one, I will say publicly, probably on my blog and elsewhere, that I've wanted my own hot tub since I left Calif in 2003 and that it's insane that something so good for the human body is so hard to get access to outside the home. There are, in Calif, hot tub places in every town, like bowling alleys. In the east, they just don't have them. Someone should go into that business, I bet it would boom, and would help people in the east relax (not sure if that'd be a good thing or not).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the rule. When I shop on Amazon I can't find anything I want the way I wanted things when I was a kid looking through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.searsarchives.com/catalogs/history.htm&quot;&gt;Sears catalog&lt;/a&gt;. But there &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; things I wanted like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Sign-Fiber-Tipped-Black-S520/dp/B00006IFJL/ref=asc_df_B00006IFJL/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=167123392997&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13295402309173569244&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-138272589675&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Pentel Sign Pens&lt;/a&gt;, but as soon as they got them on Amazon I basically bought a lifetime supply and gifted them to a few of my friends. Of course now my once gorgeous handwriting has devolved into barely readable scratches. I almost never write by hand, maybe to address an envelope, or write a greeting card. So even Pentel Sign Pens don't bring me joy. BTW, if you've never gotten a Pentel Sign Pen they truly are wonderful. Even for adults, but as a kid, they were magnificent. I wonder if kids today have to write by hand? Hmmm. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, when I got all the boxes out of storage from Berkeley I got to go through my childhood a bit. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/gradeSchoolNotebookPage.png&quot;&gt;first page&lt;/a&gt; of a notebook, either first or second grade, probably second. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a process at work here that I'm just beginning to understand. When I was a kid, I had a small immediate family and a very large secondary family. My paternal grandfather had twelve siblings and most of them had relocated to NYC during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II&quot;&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt;. So my mother had a huge number of cousins, and some of them were close. A bunch of them lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5736302,-73.8634738,3a,75y,77.25h,88.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZ0iOyYfCNhPDuAIv25OiaA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Rockaway&lt;/a&gt; where my grandparents lived. But that was 50 years ago. They're all gone now, and the bonds didn't extend into the next generation. So I have a very tiny remnant of a family now. I seek friendships that can take their place, but truth is they can't. I'd pay a lot if I could buy another weekend with the relatives who are gone, even the ones who drove me crazy, but alas that is not for sale anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Though I didn't realize it as I was writing this piece, it's one of the big threads of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/23.html#a120326&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Last night was the final episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. One word review -- masterful. Lots to think about. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/mr-robot-series-finale-recap-season-4-episode-12-and-13.html&quot;&gt;Vulture synopsis&lt;/a&gt; is great, obviously it's entirely spoilers, as is this post. The big question of this episode and the entire series it turns out is &lt;i&gt;Who Is The Real Elliot?&lt;/i&gt; For that I got the same answer Time had for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)&quot;&gt;POTY in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. We're all Elliot, having constructed more agreeable versions of ourselves to share with the world, hiding who we are many levels deep, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. It's recursive, Mr Robot says. You wake from one dream to find yourself in another and another. I imagine many people will dislike the end, the same way they didn't like the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the story is real, some of it matters, but in the end not much actually changed. Mr Robot asks us to look at ourselves and our families and friends, and how much of it is what we wish it were, vs how much is as it actually is. There isn't anything unique in this story, it's really the story of our lives, waking up from the dream we concocted to get through childhood. Endings to stories are hard, the art is in where they leave you and how much they change you, and the ending of Mr Robot scores high on all counts.</description>

			<source:outline text="Last night was the final episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. One word review -- masterful. Lots to think about. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/mr-robot-series-finale-recap-season-4-episode-12-and-13.html&quot;&gt;Vulture synopsis&lt;/a&gt; is great, obviously it's entirely spoilers, as is this post. The big question of this episode and the entire series it turns out is &lt;i&gt;Who Is The Real Elliot?&lt;/i&gt; For that I got the same answer Time had for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)&quot;&gt;POTY in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. We're all Elliot, having constructed more agreeable versions of ourselves to share with the world, hiding who we are many levels deep, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. It's recursive, Mr Robot says. You wake from one dream to find yourself in another and another. I imagine many people will dislike the end, the same way they didn't like the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the story is real, some of it matters, but in the end not much actually changed. Mr Robot asks us to look at ourselves and our families and friends, and how much of it is what we wish it were, vs how much is as it actually is. There isn't anything unique in this story, it's really the story of our lives, waking up from the dream we concocted to get through childhood. Endings to stories are hard, the art is in where they leave you and how much they change you, and the ending of Mr Robot scores high on all counts." created="Mon, 23 Dec 2019 12:03:26 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/23/you.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/23.html#a120326"/>

			<description>How to make corned beef hash. It's incredibly simple. Boil some potatoes the night before. Drain the water, add a bit of vinegar, let sit, covered, overnight. In the morning, chop some corned beef, fry it alone (without potatoes). When nice and brown, put the beef on a plate, leaving the pan greased with fat from the beef. Chop an onion, fry it, then add some chopped potatoes. Then mix the two and fry together. You can add garlic if you like. Mix it up, then remove the hash and fry a couple of eggs in the same pan and serve them on top of the mound of CBH. There's really nothing to it but boiling and frying, but it's really tasty.</description>

			<title>Working with Manila</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the XML-RPC site work, I want to statically rebuild the site from the Frontier object database containing all the content as a Manila site. I have copies of manila.root and xmlRpc.root. I have gotten it to build a static site that appears ready to be built by the Frontier website framework. Now if I can only remember how to build one of those.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;at the docs&lt;/a&gt;, and for the life of me I can't find a simple explanation of how to actually build a site, which is odd because that's what the docs purport to be about. Back then we didn't do a Hello World for this problem, that helps to put the stuff you need to know first up front. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/menus/web.html&quot;&gt;Web menu&lt;/a&gt; is tantalizing but it doesn't appear to have a command that builds a whole site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've noticed recently that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpjtCv4vMGA&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;expanding an embedded tweet&lt;/a&gt; is painfully slow the first time you do it on an item on the blog.

			<description>An odd thought. The Republicans are trying to eliminate rule of law. At the same time they're rushing to appoint judges. If they're successful, judges are just people, their opinions don't matter. Why do they care so much about judges then. Also, suppose the Supreme Court says his tax returns must be released. What does he do?</description>

			<description>The thing in tech that sucks the most. A product everyone uses won't add a feature that would open it up to new ideas by independent devs. So you have to reimplement the whole thing, and convert their user base, to try out a new idea. Which means the new idea never gets tried out. First experience was MS-DOS and its lack of a clipboard in 1985. The OS had to be scrapped, effectively, because it never adapted to the more-than-one-app-at-a-time model, even though developers were achieving great success with that model.</description>

			<description>I tried watching Sunday morning TV news, in a time when there's lots happening, lots of pieces in motion, and even though the stakes are high, it's really interesting in the way the NBA playoffs can be interesting. In the last week, we finished the first round, and now there are new matchups, and public opinion matters in a whole new way. And guess what, on CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC -- they keep saying the same tired and wrong things they were saying last week and the week before. It's just a horse race to them. Nothing matters but the election in November 2020.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to, every year, name a Blogger of the Year. I wanted to keep the idea alive, that amateur writing has a place on the web. The last couple of years my focus has been elsewhere, even though in 2017, I took a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;fresh approach&lt;/a&gt; to my own blog, with imho excellent results. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a choice for this year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have a favorite blogger, perhaps a blog that goes with a favorite podcast, please add a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1208429729113612288&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's to another great year in 2020, and remember it's even worse than it appears. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My priorities for the next government include. 1. Incorporate the Voting Rights Act into the Consitution, including references to specific former-slave states that need to be monitored in perpetuity, it never expires. They've proven that no amount of time is enough, as soon as the Court declared the VRA unnecessary, they reverted to their pre-VRA approach. 2. Prohibit gerrymandering in the Constitution. 3. Prohibit corporate contributions to campaigns and make PACs illegal. Individual citizens can contribute, with limits. Get big money out of our elections. Our elections have to mean something.</description>

			<description>We didn't finish &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era&quot;&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt; after the Civil War. I think that's the bug that needs to be fixed. Maybe we need to add a dozen more free states, so we can fix the Senate and Electoral College so long-dead slave owners don't run the country. It's really ridiculous. It's kind of loopy that the first impeachment, of Andrew Johnson, was because he undid Reconstruction, allowing the former slave-owning states to bring back &quot;slavery lite&quot; -- aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws&quot;&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>My holiday binges</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+njff&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;NJFF&lt;/a&gt; this year unless there's an epic BitTorrent dump of the new releases (it has happened in past years). I live too far out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City&quot;&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt; to get to openings. So that means one thing -- binges! Here's what I have queued up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Watchmen. Everyone says it's great, so I have to watch it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Morning Show. I watched the first two episodes when it first came out and waited until the full series was out, and as of tonight, it is. It got terrible reviews, but I loved it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;True Detective. I skipped the second season, but the third is good, they say. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mr Robot finale. On Sunday. The final episode of the final season. The last episode was the big reveal, as far as we know right now, Elliot and Darlene weren't really the stars of the show, White Rose was. But there's still another hour to go, and the writing and everything has been so superb, they got me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Handmaid's Tale. I tried watching the new season earlier, but I didn't remember enough from the previous season to make sense of it. I have it on my list to try again.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Expanse? I know so many people who love it, but I watched the first season and it never got me. But it looks like it might be a Battlestar Galactica type show, which I loved. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Impeachment. Oh I hope there are leaks. McConnell deserves it. If the witnesses won't testify maybe they can share some of what they know anyway. Wouldn't it serve him right if he tried to control the flow of info, and it just flowed around him. I'd love to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/20/moscowmitch.png&quot;&gt;his face&lt;/a&gt; then!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it for now. I'll keep you posted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think now more than ever that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; is the right candidate to run against Trump. She's from the midwest, and can relate to people in Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial Electoral College states. She's a woman, young, smart, moderate and common sense &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/28.html#a221631&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the president after Trump will be a woman. She's also calm and reasonable, has worked in Congress, stared down Kavanaugh, and after Trump gets through gutting our government and military, we will want an administrator who is not quite so loud. I've said this before, we need a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/24.html#a143005&quot;&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, not just control of Congress and the presidency. We need a candidate who can soak up as many votes as possible. McConnell has to go. But we can't start putting things back together if there is a McConnell 2.0 to replace him. We also need to pass some constitutional amendments. Otherwise whatever gains we make will be short-lived. Our constitution is getting a stress test now. We will need to start fixing bugs immediately. Voting Rights Act is added to constitution. Gerrymandering is unconstitutional. Impeachment is automatic and begins on Day One. That said, my point of view is switching. If the trial in the Senate leaves Trump in the White House, unconstrained by Congress and knowing it, we're going to need a real campaigner to fight our way out of that hole. We will come to think of this campaign as nothing less than a revolution.</description>

We will come to think of this campaign as nothing less than a revolution." created="Thu, 19 Dec 2019 15:21:14 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/19/crush.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/19.html#a152114"/>

			<description>An idea for a reforming the government. North and South Dakota remain separate states, but only have two senators between them. Probably should dilute the power of other very low &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population&quot;&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; states. And that of course will have a corresponding effect on the Electoral College. The voters of these states have been terrorizing the rest of the country because of quirks in how the country grew. The cleanest fix is to undo some of the messes those compromises made.</description>

			<description>Impeachment is not a horse race. It really doesn't matter who is president after the Constitution is gone. It can't be anyone but a Trump. They will rig the election so it always works out that way. As a preview in the last election &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Russian_presidential_election&quot;&gt;Putin won&lt;/a&gt; in a landslide. 77% of the vote. Putin's opposition was not allowed to run. Welcome to the United States, assuming Trump is not removed from office.</description>

			<title>Publishing in a small town</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of ways to publish to the people in the small town I live in. The most active is the private Facebook group. An incredible resource and a good place to publish nature pictures because we are surrounded by so much of it. It's a very &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/18/photogenicMountain.png&quot;&gt;photogenic place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But my immediate neighbors don't use Facebook. So where should I post photos I want to share with them? Interestingly they used to have a blog, before Facebook and Twitter became the thing. They stopped updating. Like so many did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried starting a blog just for the town, but got some negative response. &quot;The Internet&quot; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/06/04/social-media-driven-crowds-garbage-broken-glass-force-woodstocks-millstream-to-close-for-swimming/&quot;&gt;spoiled&lt;/a&gt; some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/nyregion/blue-hole-swimming-catskills.html&quot;&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; places &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=woodstock+swimming+holes+spoiled&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, an instance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/instagram-ruining-california-super-bloom/&quot;&gt;phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; of Instagrammers showing up at beautfiul places and making them un-beautiful, un-usable. For some reason I was associated with that. As far as I know my web writing has never destroyed anything but my own privacy (esp in the early days, omg it was so fucked up what people would do). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I just want to point out the conundrum. We still haven't settled the dust on the emergence of social networks. There's no way to work around them. It's as if we live in Jersey and want to get to Brooklyn but there are no bridges over the Hudson. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish Jack and company would listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/17/151033.html&quot;&gt;my proposal&lt;/a&gt;. It's one of those low-tech things that will have a remarkable rebirthing effect on the web. I can explain why, or they could just do it, and we all will reap the rewards, but mostly them. All I want to do is publish my writing through Twitter, and make tools for other writers to do it too. It's no fun to make GIFs out of my text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want us to undo the mistake we made, collectively, in walking away from the powerful open and independent amateur publishing features of the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
