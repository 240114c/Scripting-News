			<description>People seem to feel it's over, but that's just a form of mass hysteria, they see the weather changing, winter is finally over, summer is here,  we must have survived, time to go out and play. That's evolution for you. Of course the virus is still out there hunting us.</description>

			<description>It's great to get John Naughton's &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. He writes frequently about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown&quot;&gt;contact tracing&lt;/a&gt;, as he did &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/saturday-2-may-2020&quot;&gt;last night&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that our phones can help with contact tracing, and we should be willing to give up some privacy. This is an emergency. I don't agree with Schneier who dismisses the help mobile devices could offer, but some of the comments on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/05/me_on_covad-19_.html&quot;&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt; were right on, imho. More later for sure.</description>

			<description>Maybe journalism can stop tiptoeing around the plan, and just say what it is. 1. Reduce new infections to zero. 2. Contact tracing. 3. Low-cost, fast testing. That's how we get out of this.</description>

			<title>Bill Gates fights for science</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We often wait to say the good things about people until they're gone and can't hear it. I just wanted to say about Bill Gates, he's doing good now. Standing up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/02/bill-gates-coronavirus-science/&quot;&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; at a time when that can save a lot of lives, maybe even save our civilization. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He doesn't have to take a risk now, he could, like other rich people, isolate himself perfectly and ride out the storm. Instead he's put himself out there, standing for what's right, and you know what, &lt;i&gt;that's good, &lt;/i&gt;and thanks to him for doing that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have a great birthday. I admit it. I know people who were born in the summer, so school was out when they celebrated. Or people who were born in the days after Christmas, when everyone is all finished celebrating. I was born on a day where it's beautiful weather pretty much everywhere I've lived. And school was in session and every year my mom would send me in with a box of frosted cupcakes for all the kids. So everyone had a party. And today is a special birthday, the big 65. I'm now officially old in every way. Also, now, for the first time, I get real health care. It took a couple of months of research to figure it out, but I now have a Medicare card. I also bought a Medicare Advantage plan, so pretty much everything is covered. And where my health insurance, when I've been able to get it, has been outrageously expensive, I now pay less than $100 a month for excellent coverage. Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/07/history-of-medicare-obamacare-000153/&quot;&gt;LBJ&lt;/a&gt; and the Democratic congress of the 1960s. I haven't usually written about this day on my blog, but this year has a big WTF element to it. Who cares. I'm still here, so that's something. And as they say -- still diggin! At least for now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>On March 12, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/12.html#a174026&quot;&gt;pointed&lt;/a&gt; to the day's Daily podcast with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; from the NYT re &quot;the tragedy of America's non-response to the virus.&quot; I just listened to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/04/29/847870532/what-the-u-s-might-learn-from-chinas-approach-to-covid-19&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of Fresh Air from &lt;i&gt;this week, &lt;/i&gt;in late April, with McNeil telling &lt;i&gt;exactly the same story&lt;/i&gt; about how we're not fighting the virus, the same story he told in March. I could finish his sentences. The interviewer asks the same dumb questions they all do, when will the lockdown end, what will it be like when we resume life. The frustration McNeil feels, and I feel, having heard the same story at least four times, the questions assume that all we have to do is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/penance&quot;&gt;penance&lt;/a&gt;, stay home for a while, and we will be able to go back to normal, having done our time. This is what Trump seems to think too, and the other Repubs. Maybe some Dems. That's not it.</description>

			<description>Isolating is like plowing a fire line in the middle of a city being inundated by fire. It slows the spread. But you don't get to resume life, a very altered life, until there are no new cases, until the fire is out. Until you've shut down transmission of the disease. This is not a punishment, it's how we save ourselves.</description>

			<description>I've heard it said of countries like South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam that they had a bad experiences with H1N1 or swine flu, and didn't want to repeat it with Coronavirus. Their people had experienced a pandemic, and therefore motivated to believe there was a problem before there were massive infections. This is why imho it's been so bad in the US, this is our first experience with such a bad virus since 1918. No one alive remembers it.</description>

			<title>Coronavirus in Vietnam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I keep hearing peripherally how well Vietnam has been doing with the virus, but they're rarely listed among the examples of countries that have it more or less under control.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My best source has been my old friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevegoodman2/&quot;&gt;Steve Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, who I know from Silicon Valley in the 80s and 90s, who now lives in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City&quot;&gt;Ho Chi Minh City&lt;/a&gt;. He's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broward.edu/international/Centers-And-Affiliates/Pages/Vietnam.aspx&quot;&gt;teaching&lt;/a&gt; English to Vietnamese kids. It sounds like a great life, low cost of living, great food, good work, friendly people -- until Coronavirus happens -- now it's practically paradise, relatively speaking. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write about it even if few others in America were, so I asked Steve a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1220770854796984&quot;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I listen to a lot of podcasts, and when they talk about countries that do it right, Coronavirus-wise, they almost always leave out Vietnam.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But based on your stories, it sounds to me that Vietnam is tops, or close to the top. I'd like to write about this, briefly, on my blog.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was wondering what your status is now? Are you able to go out to eat in a restaurant? Food shopping? Go to the park on a nice day? Go to a bar or listen to music?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is school back in session?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Steve's answers were so thorough, I'll just include them here: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Schools reopen on Monday and I am in a restaurant right now having breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The government here started easing restrictions last week. There are still many things prohibited though. Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/02/hcmcChart.png&quot;&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As you can see, bars and other places where many people gather are still not allowed to be open. Grocery stores and food markets have always been open, but they check people's temperature before allowing them to enter, and of course provide a face mask if you don't have one. Everybody has one though!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Our schools have been closed since mid-January, they open again on Monday, May 4th. They were closed in January for the Tet holiday, but it was only supposed to be for two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Domestic flights are just starting up again, but they still won't allow any international flights and all borders remain closed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are many articles in the press about what a great job Vietnam has done, and they have been often commended by WHO and other such organizations for their rapid, decisive, no-nonsense approach.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I typically go for an early morning walk through a nearby park. Today it was almost completely back to normal with joggers, exercisers, aerobics classes, people playing badminton, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It will be interesting and challenging to teach with a face mask on, but that is the law for now, so of course I will obey it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Today in the US known infections per million stand at 3,416. In Vietnam the number is 3. The difference is like night and day.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And we have a border with China. People are generally extremely health-conscious here. A large percentage of the population wear face masks anyway, at least in the big cities, mainly due to concerns about air-pollution. Still, it's fair to say that there was already a face mask wearing culture in place long before the coronavirus.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I am so proud of Vietnam, and very happy to be a vital member of a community here.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked why he thought Vietnam has done so well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think the government here feels accountable to the people and is especially sensitive to widespread public concerns about health and safety. The problem was taken seriously very early, and it was handled with respect for science. They deferred to scientists and health professionals and placed health and safety ahead of short-term economic setbacks. Vietnam is an up-and-comer and has experienced very consistent and seemingly unstoppable economic growth. While the coronavirus' economic impact is a massive setback, it does not change the fundamental long-term outlook for growth and prosperity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the things that I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; about the times we're in is that the news is now filled with science. So much of the news before was about optics, narratives, impressions and the like. Talking about nothing. How cool is it to see Chris Hayes listening intently to an epidemiologist. Or Fauci explaining why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/remdesivir-coronavirus-drug-experimental&quot;&gt;remdesivir&lt;/a&gt; is a big deal, while Trump looks on, nodding, not understanding a word, but letting Fauci tell the story, a science story. Now you can actually learn something, sometimes, watching the news. Now that's coool.</description>

I spoke with her three times on that trip, in Bali, Seoul and Seattle. She could have stayed in Seoul. There was some question if the flight she had booked to Seattle would actually go. There was a &quot;last flight&quot; feeling. It would be a different life if she went one way or the other. She decided to let Delta make the choice. If the plane arrived to take her home, she'd go. If not, she'd stay. She's finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nakedjen.com/nakedjen/2020/04/we-are-all-in-this-together.html&quot;&gt;written the story&lt;/a&gt;. She's an awesome writer. Highly recommended.</description>

			<description>Feeling really disoriented today. Or maybe the disorentation of life is catching up with me. I've been taking care of business, I'm more organized than ever, it feels more important for some reason. It's pouring rain out, steady downpour, for hours. Normally this would be relaxing, but today it seems weary. Maybe it's the aftermath of the humilty of the fight with Dropbox. But that did clear a lot of the fog about how I manage my apps. Or the despair of Maddow, last night -- and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Lollardfish/status/1256195816215261184&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; I read on Twitter this morning. &quot;The Trump Administration squandered April. As Americans sacrificed and far too many died, Trump watched TV and tried to direct cash to political pals.&quot;</description>

			<title>Glitch update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was emailing with Anil Dash about &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;. Learned a few things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The GitHub integration is still early. The problem is that when you update from a repo, it wipes out all the other files in the project. The data and settings. But that's going to be fixed, he says, and when it is I will be able to connect to a project through the GitHub version.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also good to know is that you can change which files cause the app to restart by adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/edit/#!/watch-json?path=README.md%3A1%3A0&quot;&gt;watch.json file&lt;/a&gt; to the project. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also my test server, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;pagepark.glitch.me&lt;/a&gt;, is still running. A reminder that my stack (still) works there. Node is a good platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the Glitch folk can answer the other questions I asked here in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/&quot;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub is a good place to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
