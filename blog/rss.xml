			<description>Mid-morning yesterday I realized that what I had been writing on this blog and elsewhere for months, if not years, amounted to one simple idea. &lt;i&gt;Waiting for other people to save us isn't working.&lt;/i&gt; What could I do to focus on that idea? I decided to use my blog home page for 24 hours to say it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/blackout/&quot;&gt;That is what&lt;/a&gt; appeared on the home page of Scripting News yesterday.</description>

			<description>I don't understand why the NYT would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/personaltech/tech-reporter-does-not-use-tech.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimesbusiness&quot;&gt;employ a tech reporter&lt;/a&gt; who isn't immersed in tech. The world is. Walk around any city if you doubt me. I haven't read many of his stories, but I would wonder if he's missing something important since he basically is one big blind spot when it comes to tech. I'm hoping the reporter who reported on the reporter was exaggerating, as they sometimes do. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The Democrats have a new campaign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/18/house-democrats-midterms-campaign-slogan-730907&quot;&gt;slogan&lt;/a&gt; &quot;For the people.&quot; It's close. But it betrays an attitude that separates you from us. Better to get down in there. Luckily there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/item/48034353/&quot;&gt;very American idea&lt;/a&gt; that fits. &quot;We the people...&quot; I'd leave the elipses in the expression to let memory remind us that we remember who we are.</description>

			<description>BTW, I hope no networks are planning to televise Trump's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/18/military-parade-requested-by-trump-initially-estimated-to-cost-12m-official-says.html&quot;&gt;military parade&lt;/a&gt;, but I suspect it's a lost cause.

			<title>Trump can't arrest McFaul</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Re exaggeration to feed our &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/19/131456.html&quot;&gt;rage addiction&lt;/a&gt; -- a classic example. The president is considering whether to accept Putin's proposal to give Mueller access to the twelve &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Intelligence_Directorate&quot;&gt;GRU&lt;/a&gt; hackers in exchange for being given access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McFaul&quot;&gt;Ambassador McFaul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Browder&quot;&gt;Bill Browder&lt;/a&gt; and a few others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was a cause to set our hair on fire? It's a fantasy. It might happen in a few years if Trump is able to establish a dictatorship with no rule of law. No doubt he fantasizes about that, but it isn't happening now.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet Maddow and McFaul and a hundred reporters we'd like to respect pretend that Trump could do this! Hah. He's having a meeting about it, says Maddow. The mood is somber. This is gross malpractice. She must know it's no threat, that someone in the meeting would ask Hey boss, how exactly do you plan to get McFaul to show up for this interrogation? That would be the end of the discussion. No judge would sign a subpoena. No cop would arrest him. What would the charge be? We have the rule of law in the US, and thank goodness it's holding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is plenty to be upset about, but this is a cheap thrill. The liberal media is being every bit as bad as Fox News. Cut it out. We have minds, we're educated and we know when you're bullshitting. This is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>We're addicted to rage</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Look at how awful this thing is, and that. And we exaggerate to make things look worse than it is (more on that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/19/132508.html&quot;&gt;in a bit&lt;/a&gt;). In the meantime, what we were told would happen is happening. We're losing our will to act. We had great demonstrations around the inauguration. But that wasn't enough. Isn't enough. We have to be smart. Learn from the experience of Russia and Ukraine. What would the resistance there do differently if they had a do-over? We have a chance to look at our own future, and change direction. We keep missing chances. We have all the tools we need to make it work. But we have to risk, we have to be willing to sacrifice. Before it's too late. Because every day it's too late for what we could have done yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I know this is like pissing in the wind, but here's an idea for a demonstration that might impress the Repubs in Congress. In every one of their home districts, people march to their polling place, next Saturday or the Saturday after that. Carrying signs that say &lt;i&gt;We Know How To Vote,&lt;/i&gt; with the name of their congressperson on it. Go out of the way to recruit Republican-looking voters. Make sure the TV cameras are there.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt; says the reason Trump is so deferential to Putin is that he is deeply in debt to Russian oligarchs. His problem isn't a pee tape, it's that Trump's wealth is Russian wealth. That fact is about to come out publicly, and Trump was afraid it would come out at the press conference, with the whole world watching with the cameras on his face. That's what they talked about privately, and that's why Putin had such a big &lt;a href=&quot;https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+grin+like+a+Cheshire+cat&quot;&gt;grin&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>How to put this -- it's nice when a journalist or political figure correctly explains out how technology works. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1019082628341948422&quot;&gt;Noah Smith&lt;/a&gt;, an opinion writer for Bloomberg, advises a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo/status/1018944985415249924&quot;&gt;columnist&lt;/a&gt; for the Washington Post that muting on Twitter is not a good idea, that blocking works better. I saw his post because it was RT'd by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/de1ong&quot;&gt;Brad DeLong&lt;/a&gt;, an economic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Bradford_DeLong&quot;&gt;historian&lt;/a&gt; at UC-Berkeley. I chimed in -- &quot;You are right. They are trolling you, [and when you mute them] you just don't know it.&quot; And even if you block them, they can and do still go one-on-one with people who engage with you, and there are no tools on Twitter to stop that. But at least when you block them you keep them from broadcasting to everyone who follows you.  Bottom-line: Block trolls, don't mute.</description>

They are trolling you, [and when you mute them] you just don't know it.&quot; And even if you block them, they can and do still go one-on-one with people who engage with you, and there are no tools on Twitter to stop that. But at least when you block them you keep them from broadcasting to everyone who follows you.  Bottom-line: Block trolls, don't mute." created="Tue, 17 Jul 2018 12:57:11 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/07/17.html#a125711"/>

			<title>We're complicit, part II</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/08/011714.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about how Americans are like people who worked at Microsoft in the 90s. You can't separate the people from the group. In that sense, no matter whether you voted for Hillary or Jill or Bernie, or whether you marched with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pussyhatproject.com/&quot;&gt;pussy hat&lt;/a&gt;, or write angry tweets, if you're an American, you're complicit. Eventually you will be blamed for what America is doing, and that's fair and just.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Truth is, Americans are lazy. How did we get this way? We let two wars be fought in the 2000s, with no draft, not only no wartime tax increase, but a tax &lt;i&gt;cut. &lt;/i&gt;And we let the government get away with not showing the returning flag-draped coffins. We fought two wars in Asia (still are, btw) and you'd never know it at home. That imho is a crime. You shouldn't be able to fight a war without feeling a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, maybe we should be doing more than being outraged at why the Republicans don't act. Remember Gandhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/24499-be-the-change-that-you-wish-to-see-in-the&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Be the change that you wish to see in the world.&quot; In other words, in more American terms, stop waiting for other people to save your ass, risk some of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; security for the greater good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head I thought of something we can do right now. Stop. Don't go to work for the rest of the week. Don't buy anything. Stay home, or go out and march. Stop the US economy. Make it clear what we want. Trump either resigns or the House impeaches him. There's plenty of time between now and Friday to do that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we ground the economy to a stop that would make the world take note. Very likely the big companies would join the protest, and people around the world would join too. We fancy the US is the leader of the free world (obviously our president no longer is). How about a little of that famous leadership, from the people of the United States?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a new Uber commercial playing on TV in NYC. First they take you to various neighborhoods, esp Hispanic, black or Asian neighborhoods. Outlying neighborhoods. This is the real NY, they say, or imply (I don't remember which). Try to get a fucking cab to take you to one of these places. Or pick you up. At Uber, we love your stupid neighborhood. So fuck DiBlasio, the fucker, and the cab companies. They're just out to fuck you. But Uber loves you. Uber. Of course they don't say all that, but the message is unmistakable.</description>

			<description>Happy to report that an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/87&quot;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; test app took about ten minutes to write and install. They make it sound like installing the native portion is some huge deal. It's not. I would share what I have so far, but I just followed the instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-sqlite3&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. They work, and the demo app works. I have an interesting project in mind, but first I have to learn more about SQLite to see if it's feasible. Still diggin. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you’re a developer who works inside a news org, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/13/175214.html&quot;&gt;here’s a plan&lt;/a&gt; for how to create a great set of whitelists of news that’s trying to get it right. This is based on what I learned bootstrapping blogging and podcasting. The same ideas should work for journalism, at least as starting points. We have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/30/122337.html&quot;&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt;, and not wait for the tech industry to do it, imho. We can do it. Programmers can save the world. (Not really exaggerating.)</description>

			<title>Listening when it's especially hard</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/10/133458.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, listening is hard. It's even more difficult when someone wants to report a problem. This comes up in all kinds of relationships, it even models software bug reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a scenario. A person with a missing leg says &quot;When you push me, I fall over and that hurts.&quot; Here's a list of possible responses, from best to worst.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you understand what they're saying, just say that, literally: &quot;I understand what you're saying.&quot; If you don't understand, then say that, but only if you really don't understand.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't defend yourself. For example &quot;I didn't know you only had one leg,&quot; or &quot;I didn't know if I push you you'll fall over.&quot; The person just wants to know you heard them. You're changing the topic to something about yourself. This leaves the question of whether you understood out there, unanswered.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't argue. &quot;The leg you say is missing is really just shorter than the other one, it's not actually missing.&quot; We're getting very far away from &quot;I understand what you're saying.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even worse. &quot;It never happened&quot; or &quot;I didn't push you over.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Worst. &quot;What about the time you said I was stupid.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure you see the analogy to software bug reporting. We want to know that something went wrong, so we can fix it, and make the product work properly. Same thing in personal relationships. If you care about the other person, you want to know that something you're doing is trouble for them, so you can stop doing it. There really is no better way to show that you care for them than listening when it's especially hard to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, why keep the response focused on the problem?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It builds trust. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It encourages the other person to report other problems, so the relationship can be further optimized.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It makes for a happy family!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What we need from news orgs re fake news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a timeline.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Each news org should produce a list of news orgs they feel produce news that's not fake. Each should use whatever criteria they feel is right. Publish the list.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Evolve the lists over time. This problem is not going to be solved overnight. The process will take years to sort out. In the process we will learn a lot. If it works, it will transform news to make it much more useful because it's online and not print. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Techies, both companies and individuals, will build news products based on the feeds. For example, Facebook might offer a choice of news selected by different news orgs. An open source group could create software that flows Twitter-like news feeds from the lists. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This will become competitive. Some pubs' lists will fall out, others will rise to the top. There will be surprises. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Include blogs in the list, blogs that cover territory that you cover. For example, the NYT would include bloggers who cover neighborhoods. Tech pubs would include tech bloggers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Include your entire news flow in your list. Amazingly some news orgs do not have a comprehensive list of every news article they publish in reverse-chronologic order. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You may choose to make your list a feature of your news site. You may also use other organizations lists as a feature on your news site.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let's discuss our experiences at a future-of-news conference. After a few months' experience we should be ready to learn from each other. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is not something tech companies can do for you. People whose work is producing news should come up with ideas for figuring out what is and isn't reliable news.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The canonical &quot;fake news&quot; site, Infowars, will of course produce their own list of reliable feeds. Totally valid. People who want to be informed by them may choose to do so. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Notes on xrefs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html&quot;&gt;One year ago today&lt;/a&gt; I introduced a feature that allowed me to include a post from Scripting News within another post. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html#a033236&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, and the video &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html#a052616&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;. I wondered if I would use the feature. I haven't. But I forgot it was there, and forgot how it works. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/13/headlineTooBig.png&quot;&gt;CSS problem&lt;/a&gt; that's shown up, when I increased the size of the titles on the story pages. I'll fix that now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a test. Breakage fixed. I changed the way permalinks to stories work. If an item has subs it's rendered on its own page. The URL will be different, so it has to be parsed differently when setting up the xref node. So this points to a story on its own page, and I'm going to work on the code to detect this and properly compute the location of its corresponding JSON file.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For the test above, the xref value is http://scripting.com/2018/07/09/143533.html&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The JSON derived from that URL should be http://scripting.com/items/2018/07/09/a143533.json&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This node is an xref. That means that in the OPML, it has an &lt;i&gt;xref&lt;/i&gt; attribute, which is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/10/133309.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a story on this blog. It's converted to the URL of a JSON file, which is then read, and included under this headline when it's expanded. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Google isn't going to like this</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;After forcing a change to HTTPS, there are going to be other requirements. They'll try to eliminate fake news from the web as Facebook is trying (and failing) to eliminate it from their silo. That's the slippery slope they are starting down. They may not feel they have a lot to lose, but &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; do. Last year I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/07/13.html#a033345&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about why I like to develop on the open web. If I get an idea for a feature, I can just do it. I could wait forever for Facebook, they don't listen to me (neither does Google) but &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; listen to me. I can do it without getting the approval of a big company -- that's the magic of an open platform. I will never give that up. I'd rather retire to Italy and make pottery and drink espresso and bubbly water. Grazie! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/silentmoviegifs&quot;&gt;Silent Movie GIFs&lt;/a&gt; is great. They show you tiny scenes from a silent movie, and then another and another, spaced out over hours.

			<description>I did a bit more development work &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/12.html#a142546&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; on a project that stores stuff on GitHub as if it were a long-term place, a place to create a historic record. Of course I question that, I did when they were an independent company. Now that GitHub is owned by Microsoft, I still question it. Not sure if it's more or less likely to survive as-is for the indefinite future. Made me wonder what Microsoft could do to reassure developers, so we'd feel comfortable treating it as a permanent resource. Clearly that's in their interest. Microsoft has embraced open source, now I wonder if they have what it takes to be a leader.</description>

			<description>I wonder why more American congresspeople don’t have blogs and podcasts. It seems they would want to communicate regularly with their constituents. Twitter has severe limits, as everyone knows.</description>

			<title>Real ideas yesterday on MSNBC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the time I spend watching MSNBC is a waste, but yesterday there were two items that were important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On MTP Daily, an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/mtp-daily/watch/rounds-sounds-the-alarm-on-trump-trade-strategy-1275006531827&quot;&gt;Senator Mike Rounds, R-SD&lt;/a&gt;, carefully explaining how Trump still has the support of his constituents, but they don't like what he's doing with tariffs. I think this is a must-listen, a real milestone, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On The Beat, author &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber/watch/trump-baby-blimp-organizer-moral-outrage-doesn-t-work-on-trump-1275099715785&quot;&gt;Tony Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, interviewed about the angry Trump baby blimp in London, said it's funny (it is!) but is far from where we should be focused. He says getting non-voters to vote is where our attention should be. Couldn't agree more. I want a system, where voters have buddies, like sponsors in a 12-step program, who they commit to voting, and they engage on Election Day and make sure they do. They escort them to the poll if necessary. We should have drills. What an incredible demonstration that would be. Far more powerful than a march. Think about it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A mutual defense pact against racism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A Twitter account called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BlkAndPr0ud/status/1016367865400832000&quot;&gt;Black and Proud&lt;/a&gt; addresses white people: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please stop saying 'I don't see color.' Instead -- I see you and your struggle, because of your skin color. I will stand with you to end racism. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I agree. Race &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; visible, and the statement that you don't see it is ludicrous. We see it. To say otherwise is to push it aside. I've written about this a few times before, once in an explainer about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/17/0880.html&quot;&gt;Black Lives Matter&lt;/a&gt;, and what it means, from a white person's perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to do more. I feel compelled, not just to make life safer and simpler for people of color, but also to put up a roadblock to racism, to let it know that it will encounter resistance. Some things are better kept under cover. Racism for sure is one of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the past I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; that we all wear Martin Luther King buttons. I felt his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/09/mlk.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; was perfect because he's a black man, he preached non-violence, and was active, not passive, in his quest for equality and fairness. A white person wearing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/09/mlk.png&quot;&gt;MLK button&lt;/a&gt; makes a statement of equivalence. Treat me as you would treat a black person. If a majority of whites wore these buttons it would make a promise to our fellow citizens, that if there's trouble, we're standing with you. &lt;i&gt;When&lt;/i&gt; there's trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be like Article 5 in NATO. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. As a white person I can't become black. But I can make a statement that I stand with people of color. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Re winning in November. In 2008, Obama had a social network of voters who met, knocked on doors, arranged a buddy system for people to vote. We should reboot that, only do it better. It's 2018, and the technology and our know-how have improved a lot.</description>

			<description>As we get accustomed to a Putin-run American government, where are our Russian counterparts -- the protestors, the democracy advocates, to school us on how to really resist the dawning nightmare. It seems there are voices missing from our conversation</description>

			<title>Parallels betw Russia and Germany</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I haven't heard this mentioned elsewhere, but there are parallels to where we're at now and at the beginning of World War II. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Russia, like Germany had been defeated and humiliated. Out of that rose a strongman, who has territorial ambitions in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As in the 1930s, the US is isolationist. This time we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO&quot;&gt;defense pact&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like we're going to withdraw from that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What it means for Europe is that they're heading for government like that in Russia, and without a strong adversary, an unchecked Russia won't stop before it runs over all of Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the relevant dates. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles&quot;&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; was in 1919 and the first territory grab by Germany was the annexation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss&quot;&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; in 1938. 19 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The collapse of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; was in 1991, and the annexation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation&quot;&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt; was in 2014. 23 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Listening</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things we learned in massage school, many years ago, was how to listen. There was an exercise I always try to remember when it's time to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The group separates into pairs. Seated on mats on the floor. Spines straight, head straight, not tilted in or out or to a side. One person speaks and the other listens. The speaker just talks, no rules there. Share whatever you want. Anything. The listener says nothing. Your body doesn't move in or out. No hugging, touching, no words. Your eyes stay neutral. No facial expressions. No empathy, no approval or disapproval, just hear what the other person is saying. Understand that they are this person's words. No response is allowed.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These days, when it's time to listen, I allow myself to put a hand across my mouth as a signal to my subconscious that it's time to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What made me think of this today? I listened to the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/&quot;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; podcast, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/617/fermis-paradox/act-two-2&quot;&gt;second segment&lt;/a&gt; was a couple's therapy session. One was speaking, the other wasn't listening. If you're in a troubled relationship, I highly recommend the podcast. And if you can find someone who will pair with you on the listening exercise, above, I recommend that as well. You may be surprised how hard it is to stay centered, neutral, just listen, not go in or out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/10/27/listeningIsHard&quot;&gt;Listening is hard&lt;/a&gt;. If more people learned how to do it, we'd be better off. There would more love. People would understand that their friends and partners are real people, not just screens for projecting their movies on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
