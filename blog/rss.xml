			<description>One of these days a thinker-about-journalism is going to have an epiphany, like this. Hey the crisis in journalism isn't just about me and other journalists. The people need and want journalism too. Maybe we should include them in the discussion about what to do?</description>

			<description>I recommend watching this 9-minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH5oW3ynOFk&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kendzior&quot;&gt;Sarah Kendzior&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 about her experience as a journalist in NYC in 2000 and how things changed. At the beginning, she was paid enough to rent an apartment in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Queens&quot;&gt;Astoria&lt;/a&gt; for $900 a month. By 2015, the same apartment rented for $2500 and her former job at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/&quot;&gt;Daily News&lt;/a&gt; was now an internship that paid nothing. It's the first time I've heard the story told by someone who is not going on to say how tech needs to pay for the salaries of reporters. Her story is simple, compelling, and gives the problem of what to do to the listener. From here we can begin the discussion about how we proceed. Do we bet everything on finding a business model that returns journalism to the model that worked before the web? And if we do that, is that all we do? Is there no Plan B? No way to hedge against that not working? The truth is we need journalism. My job, as I see it, is to work on Plan B. Always have seen it that way. I'm not Craig Newmark or the Knights. I have no vast pile of money to pay to journalists to keep them employed. And even if I did, I think that's the wrong answer. I believe we need journalism to work. We all do. And I think it has to work &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; than it has worked before the web. My answer is not popular with journalists. They have a lot of power to shape the discussion, but journalism does not exist to serve them. It's for all of us.</description>

			<description>The Boston Celtics were so good last year, even though their two biggest stars were out for the playoffs, and this year they're struggling, even though they're both playing. More proof that teams are not arithmetic. There is such a thing as chemistry.</description>

			<description>I was asked how I feel about my new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/forester/index.html&quot;&gt;Subaru Forester&lt;/a&gt;. I love it. It's a sweet car all around, but the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; thing about it is it fits me. For my whole life I've been driving cars that were too small. I'd have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=contort&quot;&gt;contort&lt;/a&gt; myself to get in and out. Not the Forester.</description>

			<title>Does podcasting need a Netflix?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's time to do some work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;Podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt;, to make it possible for anyone to turn a list of podcast feeds into a reverse chronologic river of new shows. Help the open network push back against the VC-backed silos.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The diff betw podcasts and Netflix, btw is this. Movies and TV shows are almost all licensed, because they are very expensive to produce. Podcasts are not expensive, yes I know some orgs spend a lot of money but I don't think that makes them better. And the infrastructure for movies is super expensive and the infrastructure for MP3s is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of reasons why podcasts will never need the kind of service that Netflix provides for video. But if we don't put up any open services, the lock-in might happen anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When I was a teen, buying tickets at Carnegie Hall, a nice old man said he lost his wallet. If I loaned him $20 heâ€™d send me $50 when he got home to Connecticut. I gave him the money and my address. The old guy is Trump and his voters gave him the money.</description>

			<description>Over on Twitter, a question -- &quot;What do you do to feel more confident?&quot; I have an answer, but it's sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NSFW&quot;&gt;NSFW&lt;/a&gt;. So I'll post it here instead of there. Certain drugs in  your bloodstream give you confidence. Not sure if this is true for women, but it is true for me, and I'd guess for other men. So when I'm feeling frail, or sad, or lacking direction, I stimulate my body to produce this drug. It's never failed. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Buying furniture online?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The web is showing me lots of furniture ads these days. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hayneedle.com/product/kodiakfurniturealbanylinenconvertiblefutonsofa1.cfm&quot;&gt;example of an ad&lt;/a&gt; for a simple convertible couch that looks really nice imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing I don't understand. How can you buy furniture online? I can't get a feel for it. This little couch is very cheap. It must feel cheap, right? But it doesn't &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How can people buy something like this without sitting on it first? How does this work? Plenty of people must buy this way or there wouldn't be so many businesses selling this way, I assume...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
