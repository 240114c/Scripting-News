			<description>I made a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/senate2018/&quot;&gt;Democratic candidates&lt;/a&gt; for Senate in 2018 so I could donate to all. There are 34 total candidates. The normal 33 plus the special election for Al Franken's seat in Minnesota.  So if you wanted to give $25 to each, it would cost $850.</description>

			<title>Being picky is for losers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I find people who are willing to trade off moral superiority against losing the election, still, given all that's happening, the most depressing thing about American politics. No one cares about your &quot;point&quot; -- we're trying to get back on course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of an analogy. Suppose you're taking a car trip and your navigator decides to take you over a bridge that's washed out because it's shorter than the detour that isn't washed out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to give up one thing to get the thing you really need.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Manchin voted for Kavanaugh. His opponent will for sure vote with McConnell on everything. Manchin would not have been the deciding vote if it came down to that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a real joy in giving up on perfection. Now you can get something done.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>#metoo as a political issue</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A longtime friend was taken down by #metoo. Lost everything. The screed against him, posted on Medium, when edited down to real, not imagined, accusations was that when he was drunk he felt the breasts of a woman who was also drunk, in public, at a party at a tech conference.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He admitted it, and apologized, even though because he is an alchoholic, he had no memory of it. I thought the accusation should have been made without a lot of the imagined offenses, very clearly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't one of the famous targets of #metoo, he was just quietly deleted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No, I don't think it was fair, but that isn't the point of my story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted a note of love and support for my friend on Facebook, and almost immediately the threats of accusations against me came both publicly and privately. Nothing that amounted to anything, but it made it clear I'd better shut up, or else I'll be joining my friend in oblivion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was terribly sick in 2002, he was one of three friends who stood by me. He came to visit regularly while I was recuperating. He always listens when I have something to say. He's a good friend. He also can be a total jerk. I've seen that too. He got drunk on a lot of bullshit, not just alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since then the #metoo parade has passed him by. I'm sure very few people remember what happened to him. But he can't get back on his feet. He's in AA now. He's become a house husband, taking care of the kids while his wife works. I'm sure some people take pleasure in this, feel it's only fair that a man's life be destroyed this way, because so much terrible stuff has happened to women.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally I get to the point of the story..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you're right, in some moral way, maybe men do deserve this. But while my friend's life has been destroyed, he can still vote. His friends can vote. I won't vote Republican because of this, but I would like the Democrats to start worrying about this too, not seeing it as so one-sided, that all women are right and fair, always, and would never accuse a man of doing something he didn't actually do. Or wouldn't embellish it to make it more dramatic. Or use an accusation to get even for some other perceived offense. Or maybe for no reason at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Women are people, as humanly flawed as men. Give them a way to hurt other people, and they will use it. The idea that a woman would never make an accusation unless they knew it was true is incorrect. So we need to do better than simply &quot;believe the woman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, there was abuse in my family when I was growing up. So I know how it ruins lives. I've written about it on my blog. There's a lot more I could write if I had the courage to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Because there is unfairness in the #metoo movement, because it silences a legitimate point of view, it gives the Republicans something to campaign on that resonates. We have a problem. Much more than Kavanaugh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Something in Kavanaugh's opening statement I never understood. He said: &quot;As we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around.&quot; What is he talking about? Bush v Gore? The 9-11 attacks? The war in Iraq? The Swift Boat travesty?</description>

			<description>After Kavanaughâ€™s opening statement that should have been it, but the Dems didnâ€™t think on their feet. They had their plan, why not let the FBI investigate. But they now had something much stronger. Kavanaugh had disqualified himself. The press missed this too. But it's weird the Dems missed this. How many of them are former prosecutors? At least Blumenthal, Harris and Klobuchar are. I can't believe they didn't notice his testimony had crossed a line. They should have questioned him on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/02/kavanaughExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;every word&lt;/a&gt; in that three paragraph flameout. On TV while everyone was watching, and all the Repubs could offer was the prosecutor from Arizona.</description>

But they now had something much stronger. Kavanaugh had disqualified himself. The press missed this too. But it's weird the Dems missed this. How many of them are former prosecutors? At least Blumenthal, Harris and Klobuchar are. I can't believe they didn't notice his testimony had crossed a line. They should have questioned him on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/02/kavanaughExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;every word&lt;/a&gt; in that three paragraph flameout.

			<description>There's conventional wisdom in the tech world that only standards made between big companies matter. In my experience, without exception, it's the exact opposite. Only the ones that grew &quot;in the wild&quot; (from the BigCo perspective) work as standards, as opposed to PR hype.</description>

			<description>In the early days of #metoo there wasn't much point in trying to say that there were men who were respectful of women. Men who see women as people, just like they are, and believe in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule&quot;&gt;Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt;, and apply it. There was an angry hashtag for this, #notallmen, which translated as #wedontwanttohearit. Even so, I believe that most women get that men are people, just like they are. We know that there are all kinds of people of all genders, with issues that were created through their families or genes or other factors. There are differences in bodies and strength, but I have wanted to say that our bodies are the same size online. It was therefore refreshing to see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/10/4/17933530/sexual-assault-me-too&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, that started as a Twitter thread, written by a woman, who says what imho needed to be said.</description>

			<description>Some TV series are special, like dessert, like a rich layer cake with lots of sweet frosting and butter. You eat the slice slowly, savoring every bite, and even so it disappears too quickly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt; is like that. Some episodes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones&quot;&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt;. The entirety of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;. And lately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Maniac&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix was savory in that sense. NakedJen is watching it now. Hope she loves it. I just saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DanDotLewis/status/1047845366681554944&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; from a friend on Twitter saying he had watched four episodes of Maniac and was giving up. I know the feeling. I went through that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Rock_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Castle Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The first episodes were great but then I lost interest. I did manage to muddle through, because I wanted to know how it ended. Then there are shows that everyone loves that I can't even get started with. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Peaky Blinders&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Expanse&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot figure out wtf is going on in that one. I feel if I can just gain traction I'll love it. But I never have been able to.</description>

			<description>Trump pretended he didn't know what the KKK is when David Duke endorsed him. He led cheers of &quot;Lock her up&quot; referring to Hillary Clinton. He praised Nazis who marched in Charlottesville and ran down a crowd, killing a woman. And so much more. This is a depraved narcissistic madman. A very dangerous person. So you're surprised he dissed Dr Ford? It was 100% predictable.</description>

			<description>I had a thought, I wonder if it's true, that most tech begins open, as a skunkworks project by a geek or two. If it catches on, inevitably someone tries to commercialize it. Often they are successful and the open version languishes. We should pay attention &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it's commercialized, and understand the freedom that comes from its openness. This came up in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/01/141620.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote on Monday. Let's appreciate the Joni Mitchell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUo9C1vUt0A&quot;&gt;view&lt;/a&gt; of things: there's something inherently good and sweet about the &quot;one-man band by the quick lunch stand.&quot;</description>

			<title>Font Awesome and Medium-Editor</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've become email friends with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davegandy&quot;&gt;Dave Gandy&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. I can't sing the praises of that product high enough. It's a life saver, if it didn't exist, I'd still be stealing graphics and they'd suck as icons. FA takes care of an important part of the UI of the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second disclaimer, I juggle so many external technologies I don't have the bandwidth to dive into any of them too deeply, so when I think I uncover a problem, very often it's just a lack of info, a misunderstanding, or due to the fact that I exist in a perpetual state of developer fog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OK with those disclaimers, here's the narrative:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;Medium-Editor&lt;/a&gt; in some of my projects. It uses Font Awesome for parts of its UI. I also use Font Awesome in all my projects. I recently upgraded to version 5.2.0. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I notice that the tool bar in my Medium Editor instance has breakage. The big H for H2 and H4 are missing their H's which are Font Awesome objects. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icon/header/&quot;&gt;fa-header&lt;/a&gt; specifically. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/03/mediumEditorToolbar.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; showing what the toolbar looks like when it's working properly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On investigation it appears it is missing in 5.2.0. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/icons/heading&quot;&gt;fa-heading&lt;/a&gt; object looks very much like the original fa-header. Is it possible they changed its name?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I look to see what version of Font Awesome the Medium-Editor &lt;a href=&quot;http://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; uses. It's 4.4.0. So I try including that version in my app and &lt;i&gt;the H's come back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So my conclusion is there is breakage between Medium-Editor and Font Awesome. I am downgrading this app to use the old version of FA. However, there was a reason I upgraded, so my software is in a weird state of disrepair as a result of this workaround.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they did indeed change from fa-header to fa-heading, my request is DON'T DO THAT.  The world has built on your icons. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics&quot;&gt;aesthetics&lt;/a&gt; at this point do not matter. If you think the icons are misnamed, you are wrong. Please refer to the disclaimers at the top of this post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Re Democrats ruining Kavanaugh's life -- The legal system ruins lots of lives. Kavanaugh isn't special. I'm sure he's ruined a few lives himself. We should have more sympathy and grace for the Supreme Court. Putting a openly partisan hack on the court means no one will respect its decisions in the future. Not presidents, not the military, not you and I.</description>

			<description>I'm now about as good in JavaScript as I was in C or Frontier. I make the same number of mistakes in my code in JS as in the other environments, but in Frontier, I cruised through most of the fixes in a fraction of the time it takes in JS. Debugging was much faster, the data was right there in a browsable, live-editable structure. I couldn't make a statement about that before because I wasn't as proficient in JS.</description>

			<description>I listened to today's &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/10/01/254049.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Very good. Not listening to victims of abuse is an American tradition. As I've said in two recent pieces, abuse is the context of our civilization. It's everywhere. In homes and schools, offices, Congress, and you can be sure this isn't the first time a Supreme Court nominee has been a rapist (assuming he did it, which I do). We all have to learn how to listen. But getting some to listen is a start.</description>

			<description>It would be interesting if an actor who looked something like Kavanaugh, recorded a 5-minute play where he said the exact word-for-word same things Kavanaugh said in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORdRbReYOv0&quot;&gt;opening statement&lt;/a&gt; but substituted Dems with Repubs, Clintons with Kochs, left with right, and go ahead and make him black.

			<title>Anna and Stallman</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Masera&quot;&gt;Anna Masera&lt;/a&gt; interviewing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annamasera/status/1046761759476985856&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. She asked the right question. I wonder if he knows that he has to sell people on his vision. But it's amazing to see all those young minds show up where ever he does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience when I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupschool.org/&quot;&gt;Startup School&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto a few years ago. They had all these rich successful entrepreneurs on stage saying how they did it, but during the breaks I was always surrounded by young folk who wanted to know about open technology.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should have a better pitch for the kids, not all-or-nothing like Stallman, and not total rape-and-pillage like the VCs, rather here's how you can help make things better, improve chances for freedom. Because that's how imho you solve the conundrum Anna pointed out. Who goes first, business or education? Well the answer is when you have something open, use it and understand the value in it and protect it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So many people who are involved in podcasting for example don't understand how the fact that it's open means they have opportunities. Later when Amazon or Apple or Google take control, they'll wonder how to make it open. That won't work, but keep it open? That can work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also, from 2011: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/31/whyIStandUpForStallman.html&quot;&gt;Why I stand up for Stallman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
