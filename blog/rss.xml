			<description>By now it should be obvious if the news industry had built its own distribution system, they'd be raking in cash like FB and Google, and instead of laying off reporters, they'd be looking for new places to invest the proceeds.</description>

			<description>Apparently tomorrow is the day Google will start flagging sites that use HTTP, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;standard web protocol&lt;/a&gt;, as &quot;not secure.&quot; Curious to see how people react. BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/chrome-warns-of-not-secure-sites-to-cut-web-surveillance-tampering-faq/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; has auto-playing video. It may be &quot;secure&quot; but it's also obnoxious. This blog and all my other sites use HTTP. I don't see that changing. I expect this will make writing for the web more of a chore. That's life I guess. I don't want Google to be able to mold the web to its needs. I never signed on to being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/13/142326.html&quot;&gt;Google developer&lt;/a&gt;, and never would. Basic rule: Google is a guest on the web, as we all are, and guests don't make the rules.</description>

			<description>One thing you can be sure of, when a lot of reporters get laid off, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/180723/p10#a180723p10&quot;&gt;you'll hear about it&lt;/a&gt;. It's not true of a lot of other things. Big news happens, no coverage. It's not just because we're losing reporters, the ones that we have don't integrate well with the rest of the world.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/22.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I wrote that Frontier does not have hoisting. This is incorrect. It does.

My memory is imperfect. What I should have said is that I didn't use the feature, even though it was there.</description>

			<description>For my friends in journalism -- eventually Facebook, Google and Twitter will have to push the far right off their services, per your &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1329967/facebooks-fight-against-bad-content-is-as-chaotic-as-ever/&quot;&gt;wishes&lt;/a&gt;. But that won't be the end of the tectonic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics&quot;&gt;plate shifts&lt;/a&gt; in news. The right will form their own services, where your product will be excluded, and will still apply pressure on the public companies to treat your work as suspect, and they will have to give them what they want. At that point you must have control of your own distribution.</description>

			<description>Trump's latest tweet is no joke. It's a huge escalation. He blew through all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON&quot;&gt;defcons&lt;/a&gt;. The issue isn't whether or not to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1021334339399843840&quot;&gt;ban him&lt;/a&gt; from Twitter rather, where does he go for a rush after this? I &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; this about Trump as a troll in 2016: &quot;Immunity to outrage builds up over time. What pissed people off six months ago will barely show up as a blip today.&quot; You can already see that this tweet isn't getting people riled up as it might have a few months ago. They understand how his trolling works. This is a serious problem for him. Without the ability to escalate through tweeting, he might have to resort to flyovers and actual attacks.</description>

			<description>So it's almost official, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedreamshake.com/2018/7/23/17602366/carmelo-anthony-to-reportedly-sign-for-veterans-minimum-with-the-houston-rockets&quot;&gt;Melo is going to the Rockets&lt;/a&gt; for the veteran's minimum. I predict they won't like it any more than OKC did, unless Melo is willing to lead the second unit. That might work. Otherwise there's one too many on the starting unit that needs the ball. It's great that Harden and Paul have worked it out. Melo is still going to be a catch-and-shoot three point shooting guy. Not many moves to the rim for him.</description>

			<description>Libraries have a purpose Iâ€™ve never seen written up â€” as sanctuaries for children of troubled households. As a child, there was a safe place I could go at night, when things were crazy at home. A place they cared about kids, as people.</description>

			<description>When Repubs say they want to vote Democratic, the correct &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1021377132629512192&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; is to say hey great to have you on the team! Let's really make America great again. I was dismayed when people pissed all over &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Comey/status/1021132108381683712&quot;&gt;James Comey&lt;/a&gt; when he said (basically) he want Democrats to win in November. That's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; news. He found the right answer. The lights are coming on. People have so much trouble taking &lt;i&gt;yes&lt;/i&gt; for an answer.</description>

			<title>Librarians</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to say what I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/23.html#a124343&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; about libraries and librarians for many years, but as long as my parents were alive, I didn't want to write about it. I still don't want to write about it in any great detail, because I understand why it was like it was.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anger, pain and fear are passed down through generations. I knew their parents, and I knew what they all went through to get to America. I came to believe later in life that the responsibility of a parent is to do better than was done to them as a child, and both my parents achieved that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back in the 60s, when I was growing up, things were different. Now, I think a kid could walk into a police station and tell the story of his house, and there might be some help. But not then. People stayed out of the internal life of families. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The library really was a sanctuary for me. The librarians at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/queens-borough-public-library-auburndale-flushing&quot;&gt;Auburndale branch&lt;/a&gt; of the Queens Borough Public Library knew me, they knew what I was interested in, what books I liked, what stories I liked to hear, and tell. The most important thing was they treated me as a real person. For kids, even today, that's rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why librarians will always be special to me. Their ethos, their role, is so essential to a functional community. They don't get enough credit elsewhere, but with me, they are American heroes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been working on hoisting for the core outliner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. Just got it working today. Saving while stuff is hoisted was the hardest part. I don't seem to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+hoisting&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;hoisting&lt;/a&gt; defined on my blog, probably because the outliner in Frontier didn't have the feature. There are two operations, hoist and dehoist. Put the bar cursor on a headline. If you &lt;i&gt;hoist&lt;/i&gt; it, everything that's subordinate to the headline becomes your world. The other stuff is still there, but you can't see it or edit it. You can focus on just this part of the outline. I need it for my blog, when I'm working on a long post and want to quickly scroll to the beginning or end. &lt;i&gt;Dehoist&lt;/i&gt; as you might imagine undoes the last hoist.</description>

Saving while stuff is hoisted was the hardest part. I don't seem to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+hoisting&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;hoisting&lt;/a&gt; defined on my blog, probably because the outliner in Frontier didn't have the feature. There are two operations, hoist and dehoist. Put the bar cursor on a headline. If you &lt;i&gt;hoist&lt;/i&gt; it, everything that's subordinate to the headline becomes your world. The other stuff is still there, but you can't see it or edit it. You can focus on just this part of the outline. I need it for my blog, when I'm working on a long post and want to quickly scroll to the beginning or end. &lt;i&gt;Dehoist&lt;/i&gt; as you might imagine undoes the last hoist." created="Sun, 22 Jul 2018 22:14:54 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/07/22.html#a221454"/>

			<title>How to improve Twitter in 2018</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So Jack Dorsey is looking for ways to improve Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are three I can think of:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate the character limit, allow for linking, simple styles, titles and enclosures (for podcasting). The move to 280 chars was so successful, that should be a clue. Remove the barriers to expression and let the whole web in via linking. Handle length the way Facebook does with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;see more&lt;/a&gt; link. It's good prior art. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Help news orgs create collections of news feeds for people to follow on Twitter and on the open web. I think ultimately that's what news orgs will become. Experts on where to find the people who are saying newsworthy stuff. It's not much of an evolution, it's what they've been doing for as long as I can remember. The web gives us the ability to create new structures for that. Since Twitter is a place people go for news, it's a natural evolution for Twitter. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/13/175214.html&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for how to do this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Make a commitment to developers and make it irreversible. What exactly this means is subject to negotiation. But no one company can do what a medium does. As great a company as Twitter might be, its not something companies were meant to do, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: A new rule. For every original tweet you write you have to RT someone else's.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Better to be safe. But sometimes you have so much to say, the pain is so great, it has to come out.

			<title>Being a conservative in 2018</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm a conservative. Something former-Republican conservatives can probably relate to. I think the vast majority of Americans who are freaked out about the Trump presidency could legitimately be described as conservative. However I've been voting solid Democratic since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For me, a bridge too far was the Iraq war. By 2004 we knew there were no WMDs, that the government had lied to us. This was huge. On such a serious matter as war or peace, you can't do what they did and keep the support of good Americans. At the moment they're talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2017/07/19/dont-want-smoking-gun-mushroom-cloud/&quot;&gt;mushroom clouds&lt;/a&gt; you need to suck it up and trust the government has seen something unthinkable that you can't see. Not lying out of their ass, as the Bushies were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the realization that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/21/colinPowelUn.png&quot;&gt;this moment&lt;/a&gt; was based on a lie, that meant I would never vote Republican again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I firmly believe in Choice, am in favor of radical gun control, I have a serious pre-existing condition, so I get how important health insurance is. But you could actually vote Republican before 2000 and still have these positions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And voting Democratic is no panacea.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the United States is what it is. No generation gets to radically change direction. I say that as a baby boomer who marched for peace in the 60s and 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the lesson of America.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Change is continuous. A country that still hasn't shaken off the legacy of slavery isn't going to transform into a European socialist country in a generation. Not after what we've been through in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We made a lot of changes in the last ten years. And our chain has been yanked back. Hopefully that's all it is. But it's a mistake to try to yank it again. It's time to compromise. We need to elect a president we'd all like to have a cup of coffee with. Not someone who wags his finger and talks over us. Who doesn't listen. Who is as much a narcissist as the current asshole in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My slogan, if you've made it this far is this -- Make Politics Boring Again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I felt, once Obama was elected, that that was as good as it was going to get. We are the United States. That means we're fucked up. But at least let's think a bit before we start pushing people around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Toby Ziegler nails it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4vU1ygmq-s&quot;&gt;this scene&lt;/a&gt; in The West Wing. &quot;They'll like us when we win.&quot; This could be the motto of America right up there with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum&quot;&gt;E Pluribus Unum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It tells an app how to be notified immediately of an update.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing. The Twitter feed gets the update immediately now. Sometime in the last year (?) or so it started being instantaneous. Unless they're polling the feed ridiculously often, they must be hooked in through the &amp;lt;cloud&gt; element. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they did, I think this is very cool. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Not left or right</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't like &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; -- because it implies that there are just two answers for everything, and a formula that leads to a correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every left person thinks this way and every right person thinks the opposite on everything. I doubt if anyone is really like but I am not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am neither left or right. I think for myself. I try to understand each issue and form my own position. I do not delegate my thinking to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why Facebook doesn't ban liars</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, but it may be because I'm a neophyte in most of what they cover. When they cover Facebook, and other tech industry topics, they are the neophytes, and imho, they once again, imho, have missed the story in &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/07/20/570056.html&quot;&gt;today's podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The story is Facebook's attempts to regulate the virality of lies. They're not trying to eliminate the lies, because as Zuckerberg states, we all make mistakes, and if they banned people or organizations that told lies, they'd be banning a lot of valuable interactions and people. Instead, when a story starts going viral, and if it's a lie, they tell the algorithm to ignore its popularity. To me, someone with some experience managing online communties, though not at the scale of Facebook, that seems to be a clever and wise solution. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Times reporter wants them to do more. He says Zuckerberg will have to use his power. He has no obligation to be fair, applying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; of a western democracy to speech on Facebook. He could do what the NYT would like him to do, ban Infowars, Breitbart and Gateway Pundit, and keep the NYT and Washington Post. But this isn't what Facebook wants.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if Facebook banned Infowars and Breitbart and other lie-spreading make-believe news orgs? They'd start their own Facebook. You might think it's not possible, but Facebook knows how many followers they have, and how hard the technology is. &quot;Facebook is a business,&quot; Zuck said. And as a business he has to think about growth, and defending against potential competition.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last thing he wants is to give the right-wing infowarriors an excuse to move their users off Facebook and onto a right-wing-approved social network. I am sure that's coming, btw. I'm sure he's sure as well. And he wants to put that out as far in the future as he can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Any senator could stop this</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If a Republican senator wanted to do something brave to call a timeout on the Trump presidency until some basic questions were answered, all they would have to do is this...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Announce that they were voting against &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2018/07/17/kavanaugh-has-least-support-of-any-supreme-court-pick-in-three-decades/&quot;&gt;Kavanaugh&lt;/a&gt; and make sure everyone understood this is why. Then a few other Republican senators can join in, and then we'd have a bi-partisan discussion of the very minimum loyalty we insist on from a POTUS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Congress can act as representatives of the people. Never mind what they say to pollsters' questions. Imagine they knew how disloyal the president is. Act as a way of preventing the First Amendment being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_is_not_a_suicide_pact&quot;&gt;suicide pact&lt;/a&gt;. Which is what's actually happening. Fox News has taken control of the political process, more than Trump, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: Andrew Sullivan &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/amp/2018/07/andrew-sullivan-why-trump-has-such-a-soft-spot-for-russia.html?__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, persuasively, why this won't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Mid-morning yesterday I realized that what I had been writing on this blog and elsewhere for months, if not years, amounted to one simple idea. &lt;i&gt;Waiting for other people to save us isn't working.&lt;/i&gt; What could I do to focus on that idea? I decided to use my blog home page for 24 hours to say it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/blackout/&quot;&gt;That is what&lt;/a&gt; appeared on the home page of Scripting News yesterday.</description>

The world is. Walk around any city if you doubt me. I haven't read many of his stories, but I would wonder if he's missing something important since he basically is one big blind spot when it comes to tech.

			<title>Trump can't arrest McFaul</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Re exaggeration to feed our &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/19/131456.html&quot;&gt;rage addiction&lt;/a&gt; -- a classic example. The president is considering whether to accept Putin's proposal to give Mueller access to the twelve &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Intelligence_Directorate&quot;&gt;GRU&lt;/a&gt; hackers in exchange for being given access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McFaul&quot;&gt;Ambassador McFaul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Browder&quot;&gt;Bill Browder&lt;/a&gt; and a few others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was a cause to set our hair on fire? It's a fantasy. It might happen in a few years if Trump is able to establish a dictatorship with no rule of law. No doubt he fantasizes about that, but it isn't happening now.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet Maddow and McFaul and a hundred reporters we'd like to respect pretend that Trump could do this! Hah. He's having a meeting about it, says Maddow. The mood is somber. This is gross malpractice. She must know it's no threat, that someone in the meeting would ask Hey boss, how exactly do you plan to get McFaul to show up for this interrogation? That would be the end of the discussion. No judge would sign a subpoena. No cop would arrest him. What would the charge be? We have the rule of law in the US, and thank goodness it's holding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is plenty to be upset about, but this is a cheap thrill. The liberal media is being every bit as bad as Fox News. Cut it out. We have minds, we're educated and we know when you're bullshitting. This is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>We're addicted to rage</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Look at how awful this thing is, and that. And we exaggerate to make things look worse than it is (more on that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/19/132508.html&quot;&gt;in a bit&lt;/a&gt;). In the meantime, what we were told would happen is happening. We're losing our will to act. We had great demonstrations around the inauguration. But that wasn't enough. Isn't enough. We have to be smart. Learn from the experience of Russia and Ukraine. What would the resistance there do differently if they had a do-over? We have a chance to look at our own future, and change direction. We keep missing chances. We have all the tools we need to make it work. But we have to risk, we have to be willing to sacrifice. Before it's too late. Because every day it's too late for what we could have done yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I know this is like pissing in the wind, but here's an idea for a demonstration that might impress the Repubs in Congress. In every one of their home districts, people march to their polling place, next Saturday or the Saturday after that. Carrying signs that say &lt;i&gt;We Know How To Vote,&lt;/i&gt; with the name of their congressperson on it. Go out of the way to recruit Republican-looking voters. Make sure the TV cameras are there.</description>

That fact is about to come out publicly, and Trump was afraid it would come out at the press conference, with the whole world watching with the cameras on his face.

			<description>How to put this -- it's nice when a journalist or political figure correctly explains out how technology works. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1019082628341948422&quot;&gt;Noah Smith&lt;/a&gt;, an opinion writer for Bloomberg, advises a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo/status/1018944985415249924&quot;&gt;columnist&lt;/a&gt; for the Washington Post that muting on Twitter is not a good idea, that blocking works better. I saw his post because it was RT'd by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/de1ong&quot;&gt;Brad DeLong&lt;/a&gt;, an economic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Bradford_DeLong&quot;&gt;historian&lt;/a&gt; at UC-Berkeley. I chimed in -- &quot;You are right. They are trolling you, [and when you mute them] you just don't know it.&quot; And even if you block them, they can and do still go one-on-one with people who engage with you, and there are no tools on Twitter to stop that. But at least when you block them you keep them from broadcasting to everyone who follows you.  Bottom-line: Block trolls, don't mute.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/08/011714.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about how Americans are like people who worked at Microsoft in the 90s. You can't separate the people from the group. In that sense, no matter whether you voted for Hillary or Jill or Bernie, or whether you marched with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pussyhatproject.com/&quot;&gt;pussy hat&lt;/a&gt;, or write angry tweets, if you're an American, you're complicit. Eventually you will be blamed for what America is doing, and that's fair and just.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Truth is, Americans are lazy. How did we get this way? We let two wars be fought in the 2000s, with no draft, not only no wartime tax increase, but a tax &lt;i&gt;cut. &lt;/i&gt;And we let the government get away with not showing the returning flag-draped coffins. We fought two wars in Asia (still are, btw) and you'd never know it at home. That imho is a crime. You shouldn't be able to fight a war without feeling a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, maybe we should be doing more than being outraged at why the Republicans don't act. Remember Gandhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/24499-be-the-change-that-you-wish-to-see-in-the&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Be the change that you wish to see in the world.&quot; In other words, in more American terms, stop waiting for other people to save your ass, risk some of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; security for the greater good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head I thought of something we can do right now. Stop. Don't go to work for the rest of the week. Don't buy anything. Stay home, or go out and march. Stop the US economy. Make it clear what we want. Trump either resigns or the House impeaches him. There's plenty of time between now and Friday to do that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we ground the economy to a stop that would make the world take note. Very likely the big companies would join the protest, and people around the world would join too. We fancy the US is the leader of the free world (obviously our president no longer is). How about a little of that famous leadership, from the people of the United States?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a new Uber commercial playing on TV in NYC. First they take you to various neighborhoods, esp Hispanic, black or Asian neighborhoods. Outlying neighborhoods. This is the real NY, they say, or imply (I don't remember which). Try to get a fucking cab to take you to one of these places. Or pick you up. At Uber, we love your stupid neighborhood. So fuck DiBlasio, the fucker, and the cab companies. They're just out to fuck you. But Uber loves you. Uber. Of course they don't say all that, but the message is unmistakable.</description>
