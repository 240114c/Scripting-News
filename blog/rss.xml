			<description>Podcast I want: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA&quot;&gt;Inside the NBA&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/30/charlesErnieShaqKenny.png&quot;&gt;Shaq, Charles and Kenny&lt;/a&gt;, moderated by Ernie, not just when TNT is broadcasting a game, but once a week, 52 weeks a year. I really want to know what they think. Also a Walt Frazier podcast, whenever he has something to say.</description>

			<description>How embarrassing for the Phillies, there are more Mets fans in their stadium. The Phillies are a humble team.</description>

			<description>It's nice to have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email feature&lt;/a&gt;, because of all the cool people I'm getting back in touch with. This was a good idea. And I'm glad I have control of everything about it, instead of using one of the commercial services. I have my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;blogging software&lt;/a&gt;, and it's way better than the stuff you get from commercial services. Makes sense I should have as much flexibility with the mail feature. I'm still trying to figure out how to integrate the feature in the home page of the blog. I don't want it to be too intrusive, but I also want people to see it because like everyone else I want people to subscribe.</description>

			<description>At the same time I'm rediscovering &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(musician)&quot;&gt;Sting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police&quot;&gt;The Police&lt;/a&gt;. I heard them play  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d27gTrPPAyk&quot;&gt;Englishman in New York&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiowoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;WDST&lt;/a&gt;, the excellent Woodstock radio station (I know some don't agree). It's so amazing to listen to music you loved 30 years ago. Somehow all that remains are good memories. They flood in, it's a pure happy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia&quot;&gt;nostalgic&lt;/a&gt; feeling. The way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus&quot;&gt;Don Draper&lt;/a&gt; meant it. A time you were loved. The pain from an old wound. Far more powerful than a memory alone. A time machine. A place where we ache to go again.</description>

			<title>Date formats</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I ran this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1167459202987700224&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter asking which date format you would prefer. The choices were as follows:   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;8/30/2019, 5:51:55 PM&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2019-08-30T21:51:55.810Z &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's had 322 votes so far which is a lot for one of my polls. And it was pretty ambiguous in its intent, partly due to Twitter's length limits and my own sloppiness. Some notes follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The two examples should have represented the same date-time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The first example was created by the JavaScript function d.toLocaleString (), where d is a date value. I am in the US, so it produced an American localization. In Europe it would have done it in their preferred order, 30/8/2019 etc. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The first example didn't include a time zone, even though the format provides for that possibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps a better choice would be d.toString (), which would return a string like this. &lt;i&gt;Fri Aug 30 2019 17:37:33 GMT-0400 (EDT). &lt;/i&gt;Imho that's human-readable and of course it's also unambigously machine-readable. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Net-net: your OS knows how to convert &lt;i&gt;all these strings&lt;/i&gt; unambiguously to your language's internal date representation. The argument that one is more efficient for machines is incorrect. They all work equally well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point of the poll was this: If you have a choice, the format that both a machine and a human can easily read is obviously the best choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Projects the Media Lab should do</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had high hopes when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito&quot;&gt;Joi Ito&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/science/26lab.html&quot;&gt;director&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab&quot;&gt;MIT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; because he came from the blogging world. He had been to the conferences. He was a discussion leader at one of the first BloggerCons. The open web invested in him, and in his new role, at the time, when the world had built so much on the web, it sure could have used his help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example, I'd like to see a 25-year project to help people run their own web servers. An open source project, where people graduate and go to work at companies that build on the foundation. I strongly believe that academic institutions are ideal homes for open source projects. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The press gets confused about tech issues such as Hillary's emails, or the Cambridge Analytica scandal, both of which cost us dearly, in ways we're still learning about. An organization like the MIT Media Lab can help. Have a flash conference for journalists, explain the technology in a way journalists can understand and answer all questions. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Help celebs start their own podcasts using only open technologies. No lock-in. Teach students the value of open tech.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Media and technology are too important to let it go with a shrug. They must do better. Our society depends on it. Likewise we should insist that the Media Lab use its power now for the betterment of society. What a great way to launch the careers of media technologists and help shape the future. And help us through the tough tech problems we face right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;Dave-via-email&lt;/a&gt; went out last night, the messages seem to have gotten through ok. I'm pleased with the new service. It's been almost 20 years since my blog posts were available via email. I immediately feel a stronger connection with readers, esp since more of my personal friends are reading than before.</description>

			<description>We got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/128#issuecomment-525762285&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/27.html#a133830&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt; for lawyers, from a lawyer. Recall I asked about the risks for a news org that disclaimed up front that they were not using journalistic practices, and only reported on what was obviously true. &lt;a href=&quot;Occam's News site:scripting.com&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt;. As an example the lawyer uses the assumption that Trump is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Russian+oligarch%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Russian oligarch&lt;/a&gt;, and tries to come up with a reason for us saying that. First Occam's News wouldn't have to say why they know it's true that Trump is a Russian oligarch, but if they did, they might use the equivalent of the mathematical &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction&quot;&gt;Proof By Contradiction&lt;/a&gt;, and start with the assumption that Trump is not a Russian oligarch, and prove that's not possible. It's a perfectly valid way to prove something. Anyway the discussion &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/128#issuecomment-526186621&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>An idea for the news industry to collaborate on. Sometimes a news org takes down the paywall on a story because it's important that everyone see it. Here's the idea. Make an RSS feed that combines all such stories across all pubs. Make spreading the news even more efficient.</description>

			<description>Twitter changed something important. Now if someone you follow replies to a troll, you get cc'd on what the troll said.  This is not a good feature. It means that when you respond to a troll, you will lose followers. You should be aware of this.</description>

			<description>Why I don't use &lt;a href=&quot;http://brave.com/&quot;&gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt;. I figure that once they become dominant, if they do, they'll throw their weight around in just as awful ways as Google does. So why go out of my way just to create another monster.</description>

			<description>I am, of course, not British. So I try to imagine what would happen if Trump tried to do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/protests-sparked-by-boris-johnsons-plan-to-suspend-parliament&quot;&gt;same&lt;/a&gt; as Boris Johnson, in the US. At least Trump was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-popular-vote_n_58599647e4b0eb58648446c6&quot;&gt;elected&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit&quot;&gt;Brexit&lt;/a&gt; should wait until the people decide if they want him as their leader. And of course if Trump tried to disband Congress there would be a revolution here, I hope. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🙏&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Evgeny Morozov &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evgenymorozov/status/1166424072378560514&quot;&gt;isn't optimistic&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Epstein+scandal&quot;&gt;Epstein scandal&lt;/a&gt; will have a positive effect on the MIT-Harvard community. My two cents. I would like to see MIT and Harvard people use their prestige to set us on a better course as a society. Most people there are too risk-averse, trying to protect their careers. What a waste. We don't live long enough for that to be a proper motivation imho. That said I'm not so cynical. I have been able to get stuff done personally at Harvard, it's actually a pretty good place to shake things up, if you don't care about getting your position renewed (which I guess I didn't).</description>

			<description>I was looking around for the next project to work on now that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;Dave-via-email&lt;/a&gt; project is done, I hope -- it's the worst kind of software in the world. Talk about small pieces loosely joined. Anyway that's done now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law&quot;&gt;praise Murphy&lt;/a&gt;. I was thinking after reading this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about protocols over platforms, which I could not agree with more, that I have an almost-finished JavaScript implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, running on client and server. Since it's my second time through this area, I did it better than last time. It's just a matter of writing docs, testing, and getting other people interested/excited, and most important updating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC website&lt;/a&gt;, which hasn't been touched in many years.

			<description>BTW there is still one part of the Dave-via-email feature that hasn't been tested since the shakeup, the sending of nightly emails. We will find out if that works at midnight tonight. I can't test it by sending emails to everyone. The changes weren't very great, just a URL and the format of a JSON file. I'm optimistic that it will work, but since it's software, I'm praying &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🙏&lt;/span&gt; too. If you're reading this in an email, it worked.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Everybody -- &lt;b&gt;thank you&lt;/b&gt; for the excellent help in testing this code. It was a complicated corner-turn, and it seems to work, so I stopped the test and switched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;main page&lt;/a&gt; over to the new system, and tonight the emails will go out using the new code.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed, praise Murphy. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now if you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;scripting.com/email/&lt;/a&gt; and subscribe, as I hope you will, you will actually subscribe for real. The unsub link will be at the bottom of each email.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's just a test.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;1. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/testing/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, enter your email address, click the button.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2. Check your email. If you have a confirming email, click the link. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/129&quot;&gt;Let me know&lt;/a&gt; if this worked and I'll have another step for you to test.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/128&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt; for lawyers. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Occam%27s+News%22+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=%22Occam%27s+News%22+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.1303j0j3&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about the concept of Occam's News, a service that only writes about what's obviously true. Doesn't bother with official statements or press releases. We don't interview people on the record. It disclaims up front that &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; follow standard journalistic practices. For example, it's obvious that Trump is a Russian oligarch. He meets all the qualifications. So we say that's what he is, in addition to being president of the United States. All our reporting starts with that premise, and reports Russian and American policy as linked. It's news when they deviate. We also assume that climate change is real. It's never subject to question in our reporting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MoscowMitch?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;Moscow Mitch&lt;/a&gt; is a popular example of Occam's News philosophy. The guy is owned by Moscow. He doesn't hide it. Etc. So the question for lawyers is what are the legal risks? It's not satire, not meant to be humorous (though of course sometimes the truth is funny).</description>

Doesn't bother with official statements or press releases. We don't interview people on the record. It disclaims up front that &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; follow standard journalistic practices. For example, it's obvious that Trump is a Russian oligarch. He meets all the qualifications. So we say that's what he is, in addition to being president of the United States. All our reporting starts with that premise, and reports Russian and American policy as linked. It's news when they deviate. We also assume that climate change is real. It's never subject to question in our reporting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MoscowMitch?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;Moscow Mitch&lt;/a&gt; is a popular example of Occam's News philosophy. The guy is owned by Moscow. He doesn't hide it. Etc. So the question for lawyers is what are the legal risks? It's not satire, not meant to be humorous (though of course sometimes the truth is funny)." created="Tue, 27 Aug 2019 13:38:30 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/27/moscowMitchSmall.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/27.html#a133830"/>

			<description>I'm reworking the Dave-by-email service to not require Twitter login. I want all my friends to use it, and the login is a barrier. It'll be the first new service for this blog that does not require login. To configure it you will need to log in. I'll keep you posted on progress.</description>

			<description>Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/127&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt; resolved. Turns out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/a&gt; in JavaScript is tricky re catching errors within a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp&quot;&gt;try&lt;/a&gt;. If the code being eval'd makes an asynchronous call, errors in the callback won't be caught by the try, and the app that made the eval call crashes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/127#issuecomment-524656665&quot;&gt;in this case&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagepark&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt;. The problem was introduced by a new version of Node where the callback on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_filesystem.asp&quot;&gt;fs.writeFile&lt;/a&gt; is not optional. A confluence of buried problems come to the surface, crashes the server, repeatedly, not sure for what gain. Requiring a callback when none is needed. The tail wagging the dog imho. It creates errors, doesn't prevent them. I never would have made that change to the Node kernel.</description>

			<title>An editorial for the news industry re users</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've run two Silicon Valley startups in my career, and have led development and promotion for several widely-adopted open formats. I've gotten millions of people to use my ideas. And have learned a lot doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've learned with all this hindsight, it's better if your default answer is yes, not no. See if there's a way you can give the users what they want. This approach will evolve over time, you'll learn how to anticipate their wants. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'll learn to think like your users. That's a *good* thing. That's how you create a place for yourself in their minds, their lives and their wallets. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's the users dummy!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;True story. My company was having a party in a suite in the St Francis Hotel in SF in 1980-something. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;, then head evangelist at Apple hands me a list of feature requests for ThinkTank. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He said the list was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e&quot;&gt;Jean-Louis Gassée&lt;/a&gt;, the new head of product at Apple who was moving to Cupertino from France. I handed him the list back, and said I want to meet him, knowing he would want to meet me. Finally, an exec at a tech company who used the product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This advice I would give to anyone in any industry, but never has there been an industry more in need of being their own users than the news industry. They are immune to ideas from outside. This is what's crippling their industry, not the web or whatever.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I could drive from NY to Chicago and use it on every toll on the way, or to Florida. Anyway, I think this idea would work really well for paywalls. Collect the money if I decide to read a New Yorker or LA Times piece, even though I have't got a subscription with either, which is analogous of being able to use the toll roads of Georgia even though I'm a resident of New York.</description>

			<title>Why I use Twitter identity for the new email feature</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I posted a note on Facebook for people to subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/email&quot;&gt;new email service&lt;/a&gt;, I got a bit of feedback saying it shouldn't require a Twitter login. So here's why it works that way.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am gradually adding features to my blog that involve people more in what's going on here. You can Like items. You can comment on them. And now you can receive a nightly email. All but the last require identity, and if you want any options on how you receive your email, even that feature requires identity. (No such features have been implemented yet.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've been down this road before, it's not new territory. Back in the 90s and early 00s, we had blog hosting here, each blog had its own identity namespace. So I know how much human work it is to maintain such a service. I've done it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want the identity features but I don't run the identity service. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember it's just me here, and I'm doing this for free, before you judge me too harshly. If I can give Twitter a big job, that means I can do other work, or take time off, which I'm doing more these days. I'm not that ambitious anymore, I don't have anything to prove. And I think it's fair for readers and potential readers to understand that I'm nothing more than a human. Not trying to impress you with how much work I can do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to easily add features to scripting.com. That's why I use Twitter as the identity system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is one other reason. More and more my personal context is on Twitter. When they raised the character limit to 280 chars it became way more useful and it's a pretty good adjunct to this blog for short items. Very often I write something on Twitter first, and then copy it here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm using it for comments too. Because their restrictions actually make a load of sense for comments on a blog. I really just want to hear unique ideas, or simple bug reports. If I want more I ask for it in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22braintrust+query%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;. Their limits are a practical implementation of my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;comment guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. And being able to job-out a vital feature like comments to a reliable service, as Twitter has become, and as Disqus has become unusable, that's pretty welcome too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to keep up with all the changes on the net. Sometimes a nightly email is more than it appears at first glance. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Two views of one scene</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The two views: If you live with a creative person, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRRsE0LvUqU&quot;&gt;this scene&lt;/a&gt; from The Shining will be familiar. At least you'll know other people have to deal with this. On the other hand, if you're a creative person, this scene speaks for your frustration with the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yRRsE0LvUqU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Listen to the music, it tells the story from his point of view. Every creative person can relate. Was it Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick pleading with the world to just let them create?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dave in Woodstock</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I moved to Woodstock is that I want to try for once being a software developer in an artistic context. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always seen software as a creative thing, like writing, painting or sculpting, but the rest of the world can't seem to process this idea. I've tried doing my thing in Madison, Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Seattle and New York City. Everywhere I go I get blank stares when I say I create software as an individual. But where do you work? I work for myself. Who do you sell it to? I don't sell it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do make money, from time to time, by selling something I've created, but most of what I create doesn't make money, the opposite, it costs me money to make. It's been that way ever since I was in my 20s and left Madison for Silicon Valley to make my fame and fortune. Like a musician goes to Nashville or Memphis, I'd say to my friends. I'm pretty sure they didn't believe me. I got lucky a few times, my products were hits, and I sold them to companies. I've tried being a CEO, and was able to do the job, sort of, but every day when I wake up, I'd rather create something than manage something. I don't like being responsible for other people's careers. So once was enough for being a CEO. It worked, we were able to go public, and the money I made made it possible for me to live a creative life, which is where I am most comfortable, most myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I make software for others. More recently I've made products only for myself, with pretty great results. Something new happens when you relax the assumption that the software has to be easy to learn. My target market, me, is amazingly up to speed on how the stuff works. (It's meant to be ironic.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've found it's no different here. People have a hard time understanding that you could do art with materials such as compilers, servers, editors, networks, display screens, etc. People in general have no idea what those things are but they're no less visible than the raw materials of writing (plot, character, arcs). I'm patient. Not pushing too hard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got a chance to start over, because this is not inherently a tech-loving community. The other day I used the word &quot;modal&quot; to describe myself. My friend had no idea what the word meant. I'm glad he asked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the very least I've relocated to an stunningly beautiful place, where the cost of living is way lower than in any of the previous places I've lived. The smell of the place reminds me of childhood, where we vacationed when I was young. That makes my inner child feel secure, as it did the first time around. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In a sense I want to go back to the early 90s, when blogging was still a twinkle in the eye, an intuition that if we created easy ways to publish, people would do it. The power of tech is that it becomes invisible and the message of the writer, the artist comes to the front. I see the combination of art, tech and protest being a powerful thing. We've been here before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

He didn't see an America with free blacks and whites co-existing as workable. This isn't what they taught us in grade school.</description>

			<description>There was a long piece on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-49441739/amazon-fires-president-bolsonaro-responds-to-criticism&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; this morning why Brazil's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/leaked-documents-show-brazil-bolsonaro-has-grave-plans-for-amazon-rainforest/&quot;&gt;Bolsonaro&lt;/a&gt; is burning the Amazon. They had academics theorizing, but none said the obvious reason why all Russian-inspired autocrats do anything -- to squeeze every dollar of value that's available to them by selling off some asset of the country. Usually at small fractions of a penny on the dollar. They don't care. Everything the country owns is ripe to plunder. Bolsonaro (and Trump et al) has enough bullshit to throw at journalists to keep them debating every reason but the real one, which for some reason no one seems to be able to say. They're looting their country. Same reason the Repubs in the US want to kill Social Security and Medicare. They want the money for themselves. .</description>

He isn't on the Mets anymore, he's with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Seeing his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/23/flores.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; makes me worry for his mental health. Here was a boy who &lt;a href=&quot;https://deadspin.com/wilmer-flores-cries-after-learning-hed-been-traded-sta-1720990537&quot;&gt;cried&lt;/a&gt; when he thought he was traded.

			<title>Woodstock on Netflix</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking through Netflix last night for something to watch, and they had this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81135868&quot;&gt;Woodstock title&lt;/a&gt;, so I clicked on it, thinking it was the Woodstock &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_(film)&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; from 1970, but it was something new, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thirteen.org/programs/american-experience/woodstock-kshqlw/&quot;&gt;from PBS&lt;/a&gt;, and it told the story from the point of view of the promoters. How they got the idea, how it morphed from being a studio in the town of Woodstock to an outdoor concert on a field in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallkill,_Ulster_County,_New_York&quot;&gt;Wallkill&lt;/a&gt;, the town limited the attendance to 5000 (there were already hundreds of thousands of tickets sold) so they had to scramble with just a few weeks to go, find a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Historic+Site+of+the+1969+Woodstock+Festival/@41.699124,-74.8813829,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1swoodstock+festival+bethel!3m4!1s0x89dca8a984798b11:0xe6d7490947a9149!8m2!3d41.7010945!4d-74.8804605&quot;&gt;new location&lt;/a&gt;, build a stage, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They told story of how they &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavy_Gravy#Woodstock_Festival&quot;&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; it such a peaceful cooperative event (it wasn't by accident). They were competent, smart, and driven -- and obviously under a lot of pressure from all sides, but they pulled it off. Remarkable and as it turns out, historic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I started watching i thought I'd watch for five or ten minutes, but I went all the way through. A great story well told. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It could have melted down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had to do a lot of stuff to prevent it from being a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example, they chartered a jet to fly in Wavy Gravy and Hog Farm to do security. An inspired idea. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then the NYS governor (Nelson Rockefeller) wanted to send in the National Guard to clear the place without any thought to the scale of the event. They had to somehow prevent that from happening. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They relied on army helicopters to shuttle medical personnel in, and that started rumors (remember this was 1969, it was as much an antiwar event as it was a music festival), and the guy on the PA system had to keep everything positive. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then it rained.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There was no food. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Not enough toilets. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bad trips. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who knew how crowds work said there's no way this won't melt down, but it didn't. A lot of forethought went into it. Worth watching the show just for that part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>New feature. Now you can receive Scripting News every night via email. It's still in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/125&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; and there's a little more development work to do, but it's ready for people to try it out. I created my own system because I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/09/185406.html&quot;&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; more control over how it works.</description>

			<description>It’s time for a news channel that only reports on how we’re getting rid of Trump and Repubs. If there’s nothing to report they play old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV&quot;&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; from the 80s.</description>

			<title>Dave-by-email, day 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wish I had more on the home page for what will be for many their first Scripting News &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/125&quot;&gt;by email&lt;/a&gt;. A few comments. It's a bit of a loop-close because my blogging used to go out via email for years before I went exclusively web. Once &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; was up and running it seemed counter-productive to keep pushing the email channel, and for a while it made sense until Google dominated and then shut down their RSS app. Then email resurged. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In May 2017 I rebooted the original style of blogging on Scripting News, with intermixed titleless posts and and longer titled posts, all on one page, archived daily and monthly. It's now stable, so it made sense to bring back the email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember when I turned off the email, Doc Searls said I shouldn't do it. I never forgot that. Glad Doc is in the initial group of subscribers. I think that will affect the way I write here, for the better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I plan to add the linkblog links for the day to the daily email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
