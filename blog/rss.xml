			<description>The picture, to the right, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulpfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Jules_Winnfield&quot;&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction&quot;&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/a&gt; is from (I think) the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRE23YfSvc8&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; of the movie. Here's the actual quote. &quot;Say 'what' again. Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say what one more goddamn time!&quot; As Will Campbell says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Samuel-L-Jackson-quotes-from-Pulp-Fiction&quot;&gt;on Quora&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;This entire movie is basically one bag of brilliant quotes.&quot; True. As I slog my way through the end of the last season of The Newsroom, I realize that some script writing is basically one big bag of terrible quotes. Inserted into actual conversations. And the director makes the characters scream the awful quotes as if they're being tortured. It gets so bad at times I turn the volume off. I dream of the characters killing each other in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVQ8byG2mY8&quot;&gt;Scarface-like&lt;/a&gt; ending. I think I have to go back into therapy to find out why I need to see the very end of this terrible show. (BTW one in five scenes is actually pretty good, like every &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDw8EXjusrU&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; with the Assistant Deputy EPA Administrator. And every scene with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn&quot;&gt;Olivia Munn&lt;/a&gt; is amazing. She's magnetic.)</description>

			<description>Here's a fun end-of-year game. 1. Think of the ending of Scarface. 2. Now think of movies you wish had the same ending. Examples: Forrest Gump. 2001: A Space Odyssey. Any movie starring Tom Hanks.</description>

			<title>We must compromise to keep our republic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/30/politics/joe-biden-running-mate-republican/index.html&quot;&gt;Joe Biden said&lt;/a&gt; he's open to choosing a Republican running mate. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1211775820546621441&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; I thought this was a good idea. Now to be clear, he won't choose a Republican running mate. That would be crazy, wrong, too risky by a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm sure Biden would want a close relationship with his VP, and you just can't have that close a relationship with a member of the other party. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden is old, and his running mate is important because they are more likely to become president. A Republican in the White House, no matter how inspired a choice, just won't work. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, it was a good idea, to say it, not to do it. We're at a pivotal point for the future of our republic. The current president has been caught violating the Constitution in the most egregious ways, not just in his dealings with Ukraine. It's clear that Trump doesn't understand the Constitution and has no interest in learning, or being limited by it. He's going to do what he wants to do, the same way a monarch would. This is what the Constitution protects against in a myriad of ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need a two-party system where both parties agree in the rule of law and the Constitution. Where we're Americans first, and partisans a distant second. Not just voters, but the people who lead the parties. Right now we barely have a two-party system because the Repubs are working on behalf of a foreign enemy, and against the Constitution.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To get back on solid ground, we need to split along respect for the rule of law. One party supports the rule of law, the other party doesn't. That means Democrats, the name of the rule-of-law party, must welcome people who believe in conservative policies that the Repubs used to stand for, but also believe in our system of government. A huge tent. Then, a landslide election, so that the Democrats have control of Congress and the White House and 3/4 of the state legislatures, overcoming Russian/Republican hacking, and so we can pass new amendments to the Constitution to close the loopholes that they have taken advantage of. To codify what previously were just norms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hear you saying, cynically, that'll never happen. Then my answer to you is this -- we've already lost the republic. There may be elections in the future, but only Republicans will win, the same way only Putin wins elections in Russia. I said in an earlier piece, that some friends took issue with, that the Democratic Party would be annihilated if that happened, and this is what I meant. There might still be an organization called the Democratic Party, but if they can't win elections because of corruption, well it's not really a political party is it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To win such a landslide, the Democrats will need a lot of votes from people who voted for Trump in 2016. That means compromise. Which is fine because &lt;i&gt;our form of government requires compromise, &lt;/i&gt;when it's working. So Biden saying he would consider a Republican running mate is signalling to people who voted Republican that they are welcome in the new Democratic Party. And in order to work, not only will the Republican Party have to be annihilated once and for all, so will the Democratic Party, and further, journalism will have to be annihilated too. What journalism has morphed into, where they only know about horse races, both-sides-do-it and Watergate, has led us to this place. If they continue to rule our discourse, as they have, we can't get out of the hole we're in.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once all this change has happened, then we can go back to a two-party system. We can decide what &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; mean all over again, because today I feel totally like a conservative even though my beliefs and policies are what we used to think of as liberal. I want to turn the clock back to Eisenhower and JFK, Carter, Reagan, Bush I and Clinton, where the US was fucked up for sure, but we respected ourselves and each other, at least somewhat, enough to accept the result of elections we lose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone has buried their heads in the sand and think oh well nothing has changed, when in fact everything has changed. We no longer have elections that work. Without that, without confidence that the person holding an office was actually elected to that office, we have a monarchy, and autocracy not anything like the system of government the founders designed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>'Silent data loss'</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/666805586860183&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook in 2017, never published on my blog.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Repubs use a trolling technique that was pioneered as far as I know by the proponents of a certain format that was intending to replace RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They would say: RSS has &quot;silent data loss.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This sounds terrible. Right? Well, it's just like Shariah Law or &quot;chain-immigration.&quot; It sounds like a technical thing, but in reality it's a problem they made up. In practice nothing really is lost. XML sometimes garbles stuff if it isn't properly encoded. The solution is to properly encode it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;By pointing at this and saying Oooooh silent data loss. Oooh RSS is bad, people who didn't understand would think, oh I need to change to use this new thing. Or so the proponents hope.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just like Shariah Law is not a problem in America, and chain-immigration simply means letting families come to the US (a good thing, most people would think, so why not say it that way, hah), the tech trolls were saying basically that &quot;RSS is XML,&quot; which their format was too. If everything is done right (a big assumption) you could possibly avoid &quot;data loss&quot; by using their format, or you could stick with RSS and properly encode the text. The latter approach is &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by the time you explained it the people listening were tuning out because it truly is boring, and thinking you're being pretty defensive, there must be something here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Okay I'm in Season 3 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27.html#a135542&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; now, and I bet  Sorkin isn't writing it, rather it's someone trying to write like Sorkin. It's awful. Unbearable. What would make sense is a final massacre like the end of Scarface. I'd pay to watch that. Say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVQ8byG2mY8&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/a&gt; to my little friend. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I had a feeling of total weariness this morning so I stayed in bed until 10AM, a very late hour for me, and decided finally I Give Up. I no longer am going to care about whether the world is headed off a cliff. I'm no longer going to care about anything I can't do anything about and guess what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6rE0EakhG8&quot;&gt;I feel &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now. What a relief. You know what this feels like. When I got home after life-saving emergency heart surgery in 2002 I felt like I was in a dead relative's house. Something I had experienced a few times by then. This was someone else's house. Less than a year later I sold the place and moved to Cambridge where we started BloggerCon and the podcast movement, and what a great move that was. Giving up is the best thing to do. I mean it.</description>

			<title>XML-RPC site transformation</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've started to do the transformation of the XML-RPC site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Starting today, the main site is &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;. It documents all the new stuff, and will be developed and maintained, according to any interest by the community and/or myself.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/spec.md&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; has been ported to the new site. It is not a revision, none of the content has changed. It's just in a different format on a different site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The original site has been preserved at &lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;1998.xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was started in 1998 and the main work was done by 2001. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; redirects to &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The site is backed up by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for issues and support, and to download the JavaScript implementation which I have been working on over the last year or so. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the big new stuff in this release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The reference implementation is in JavaScript now, not Frontier.  There's a client/server &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/xmlrpc.js&quot;&gt;package for Node&lt;/a&gt;, and a client implementation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/client/xmlrpc.js&quot;&gt;browser-based JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is an alternate &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/docs/xml-rpc-in-json.md&quot;&gt;JSON syntax&lt;/a&gt; for XML-RPC.  I wanted to see for myself how the protocol would look in JSON. It looks good, of course the payload isn't something we look at very often. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A new XML-RPC &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcdebugger/&quot;&gt;debugger&lt;/a&gt;, so you can test your implementation from a browser-based app. The debugger works with either XML or JSON syntax. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcbrowserclient/&quot;&gt;validator&lt;/a&gt; has been ported to the web also.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are broken links. Any links to pages on the old site that haven't been ported to the new site, and that's most of them, will be broken. They pages are still on the 1998 site, and I have the Manila source code for the pages. I will try to link to the original pages so they show up in searches at their new addresses. And time-willing, I will render the content in the new form so the links aren't broken at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I am one of the four original developers of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I welcome new implementations in languages and environments that didn't exist 20 years ago, and using new best practices. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Questions or comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/142&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>On this day we learned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/12/27/2122211/apple-news-no-longer-supports-rss&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; apparently stopped allowing users to add their own &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds to their News platform. I guess this is inline with the way they vet apps for iPhones. Can't let any random ideas get to iPhone users. Best to be safe. Perhaps to keep China happy? Not kidding. Tech companies ultimately have to yield to authoritarian countries, where they keep strict control on what the people can read. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50902496&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; can now disconnect their country's net off the world wide net. Losing a news platform like this is dangerous to freedom, pretty much everywhere. Best not to trust them with our flow of information, so use another news platform on their phones, and use other non-Apple podcatchers.</description>

Best not to trust them with our flow of information, so use another news platform on their phones, and use other non-Apple podcatchers." created="Sun, 29 Dec 2019 00:57:58 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/appleLogo.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28.html#a005758"/>

See where we put the place to enter a new post? Right in the middle of the top page. The easiest place to get back to. See the menu at the top of the page. It's the same menu on &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; page. It gets you to the full functionality which included (in 2002) an RSS feed reader. How did we get there? Factoring. Over and over. Until it was logically organized for the person who we were designing it for. Full functionality doesn't have to be a maze for users, if you put the effort in.</description>

			<title>Flow in WordPress for writers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I write about what's missing in blogging software, as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/24.html#a153850&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, someone tells me about Gutenberg, and how that's the solution to the problem I've identified.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've never used Gutenberg, so I want to keep an open mind, even though I'm pretty sure that Gutenberg, even if it's great, is not the answer to the problem I keep seeing with WordPress, have been seeing since its inception. The problem is flow. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have an idea for a post. How many steps is it before I'm writing what I'm thinking. The more steps, and the less memorable they are, the more likely it is that I will either forget the idea before I start writing, or decide not to detour because it takes too much time to record it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OK, that's the preamble, now let me record the steps that I have to take to create a new post in WordPress. I disclaim I am far from an everyday WordPress user. But I have posted a lot of stuff to various WordPress blogs over the years. I am not a neophyte. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm at the main page of my website, called Unberkeley. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/myBlogsEditorialPage.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Show me where it says New Post. It isn't there, even though this is almost always the first thing a writer wants to do when they come here.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I clicked on WP Admin, which turns out to be the correct guess. I must've been here before? Or maybe I'm just lucky. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/wpadminpage.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. (BTW, imho this is not the WP-Admin page, even though that's what they call it. That would be a page for a system manager, not a writer. No writer is going to seem themselves as an admin, nor should they. This betrays a perspective, imho an incorrect one for most people who use the product.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On this page is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/quickDraftForm.png&quot;&gt;Quick Draft section&lt;/a&gt;. I will enter the text of my post there and give it a title as the form requests I do. I like how the Content area expands to the size of the text I entered. Much better than adding a vertical scroll bar. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/quickDraftWithText.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the Quick Draft area before I click on Save Draft. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now my post is in the Your Recent Drafts list. Clearly it has not been posted, nor is there any indication of how to post it. I'm guessing I should click on its title and see what I can do from there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now I'm at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/editPostPage1.png&quot;&gt;Edit Post page&lt;/a&gt;. Imho this page should be directly linked in big bold letters from the home page of the editorial control panel. This page should be the easiest page to get to. This page also has the Publish button which I will now press.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I expected it'd take me to the published page and it would have a big Edit This Page button on it in case I see anything that needs fixing. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/editPostPage.png&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; it takes me instead. But there is a Permalink on the page. I'm going to try clicking that. And sure enough now I am at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/test-post/&quot;&gt;published post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you accept the premise that publishing a post is the Hello World of blogging software, as I believe based on 25 years experience, there is a method to straigntening this out. You go through the list above and start eliminating steps, moving the New Post functionality closer and closer to the top and making it more obvious in every step. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, there is a very small Edit link on the published page, presumably I see it because I'm the author and am logged in. Clicking on it takes me to a page I've not seen before. A much nicer-looking post-editing page. I think this should be the home page of the editing function. But even this isn't Gutenberg apparently. There's a prompt at the bottom of the page asking me to try the new block editor to level up your layout. If this is the elusive Gutenberg, they might say so. If you're going to use that as its name publicly the software should use it too. And for crying out loud there is nothing for me to click to try the new block editor. I can get Info or learn more. I just want to try it. Help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I click on the Learn more link and twice it confirms that I am ready to try Blocks. I have to convert the post it warns. OK, since it's just a test post, what the heck. First I have to page through a listicle-like tutorial. And when I get there damn if it doesn't look just like it did before. I don't know why this is so momentous. I'm going to come back to this in my next visit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Flow is the writer's problem for blogging. I have been working on this since I started in 1994. I solved the problem for myself in 1997, and ever since I've been working on solving it for everyone else. Had WordPress designers simply &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2002/01/10/dtwsEditBoxScreen.gif&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; at Radio UserLand, shipped in 2002, and copied its menu structure, they would have a much better flowing blog platform and a reader interface as a central part of the product. But since then Facebook and Twitter have matched or bettered Radio in flow. There's a new benchmark. WordPress appears oblivious. So no I don't think Gutenberg, which is a new text editor for WordPress, is the answer. It is the answer to other problems, how to mix text and other elements in a blog post. Certainly a good thing to do. But WordPress imho remains the klunky monolith that it always has been. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, you can do even better than moving the New Post command to the top of a klunky interface. You can move all the setup stuff off to the side and give the user a Facebook-like interface for writing posts. You could even make Gutenberg the default editor. The text editor imho was never the issue with WordPress -- for writers. Writers can make-do with almost anything there. But the flow from idea to idea is what writers really need. For that you should probably start with an outliner, study it, learn from it and adapt it to public writing. That's where imho the real juice is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But a good short step would be to build a Facebook-like interface for WordPress, working with the same database, so both the current and the writer's view work on the same data. Writers are important and for writers flow is everything, how easily can I get your software out of my way and flow my ideas into the minds of the readers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>During the 2016 election I watched reruns of The West Wing and found it relaxing, to be able to visualize a government run in a human and intelligent way. Last night, looking for something to watch, I spotted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/the-newsroom&quot;&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and thought I would give it a try. Perfect choice. Another Sorkin show, a bit dated, in terms of tech very dated, but who cares. It's a bunch of actors, some good and famous reading Sorkin dialog about how news would work if it worked well. I've just watched the first three episodes, it's an incredible antidote to the way news is these days. Highly recommended, and as I step through it I expect to have more to say. BTW, it's available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/The-Newsroom-Season-1/dp/B00CW8DRU8&quot;&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.</description>

			<description>A bingeing update. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/20/211446.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; on Apple, but when I picked it up again, starting with episode 4, I couldn't stand it. It was like a bad soap opera. One word: Insipid. Too bad because the actors are great and they had lots of money to do it right. The story is childish and the dialog is embarrassing. Those are also some of my criticisms of The Newsroom (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27.html#a135542&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;) but there is substance in that show and the writing is pure Sorkin, so it's funny to think the actors are just saying what Sorkin told them to say.

And that was a non-journalist writing, at least &lt;i&gt;nine years ago.&lt;/i&gt; If Sorkin could figure it out, so could Chuck Todd. He's playing us, badly and we'd be foolish to accept him at face value.</description>

			<source:outline text="A bingeing update. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/20/211446.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; on Apple, but when I picked it up again, starting with episode 4, I couldn't stand it. It was like a bad soap opera. One word: Insipid. Too bad because the actors are great and they had lots of money to do it right. The story is childish and the dialog is embarrassing. Those are also some of my criticisms of The Newsroom (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27.html#a135542&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;) but there is substance in that show and the writing is pure Sorkin, so it's funny to think the actors are just saying what Sorkin told them to say. Like Leo and Bartlet, Josh and CJ. Except not them, other people. And lots of lessons about journalism. For example &lt;a href=&quot;http://pressthink.org/2019/12/the-christmas-eve-confessions-of-chuck-todd/&quot;&gt;Chuck Todd&lt;/a&gt; is lying when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-disinformation-spreads-according-to-chuck-todd-interview-929912/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he didn't get that the Repubs were always lying on his air.

			<title>Still having problems with UPS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+UPS&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;saga&lt;/a&gt; continues. Now they're delivering packages to the local post office. The packages are clearly addressed to my home, not to a post office. This is kind of okay at least they're indoors and the postmaster there is okay with it, but they are dropping the packages off on the front desk after the post office is closed. Leaving them in the open is like leaving your wallet on the counter in the post office. People are honest, but that's too much of a temptation imho. At some point someone is going to take the packages before I can get to the PO.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've told the UPS people in Kingston this is not acceptable but they say it's the driver's call.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a comparison, I had a package delivered by Fedex a few weeks ago, when the road to the house was fairly covered in snow, and they just drove the truck to the house and made the delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is actually what they're &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to do, in other words and it's not unreasonable. The road is not on a hill, it's flat, and easy to drive on. I understand if there's a foot of snow, but so far that has never been the issue with UPS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Understandable 100 years ago when people were marveling at the things you could do by vaporizing carbon.

I knew the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/15.html&quot;&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; because I went to college &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/16.html#When:1:20:10PM&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. I think there will be a lot of Katrinas, I don't think anyone who knows disagrees. The city was devastated. It might have been technically possible to do something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center&quot;&gt;Rockefeller Center&lt;/a&gt; Christmas tree, in New Orleans, in the aftermath of Katrina, but no one would waste the effort and it would seem &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/09.html#a205150&quot;&gt;tone deaf&lt;/a&gt; a term people like these days. We're on the cusp of that. It still seems normal now to burn carbon like that, but in not much more time, we'll wonder how we ever took pleasure in such extremely negative images of how we destroyed our way of life.

			<description>I'm continuing to struggle getting the old XML-RPC Manila site to open and render in today's OPML Editor. I really want to get that site fully restored before moving on. I posted a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=footer#!msg/frontier-user/m9wdhmLRii8/nwUU7JRCCwAJ&quot;&gt;on the Frontier-user list&lt;/a&gt; where in 2015 they were talking about this stuff but never got to the resolution. When this is done I want to have an app you can run that converts a Manila site to a folder of HTML files. So we never forget how to do this again. I feel the weight of all the good work we did, and how embarrassed I am that we tried so hard to preserve things, and so far have utterly failed, at least in this one important example.</description>

			<description>I ordered a CD-ROM drive from Amazon, and am now reading backups from UserLand from April 2000. Should be interesting. I'm thinking about uploading the full unmodified archives. It includes a snapshot of all the Manila weblogs, from editthispage.com and weblogs.com. Problem is there are passwords in the files, almost 20-year-old passwords, but you know how that goes. What do you all think?</description>

			<description>One candidate could change everything by raising money to do good things for Americans right now, not after they get elected. The idea that value was flowing to the people not the owners of the media companies would inspire voters. It would inspire me. This would be bigger imho than Sanders and Warren not taking corporate donations. I think we'd welcome big corporate donations, as long as the money was flowing in a good way.</description>

			<title>A chicken or an egg?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something cute I did a few days ago. I wondered, if Twitter could handle the full text of blog posts as I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/17/151033.html&quot;&gt;advocating&lt;/a&gt;, how could it work. I came up with an approach, and implemented my side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the source of a recent post here, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/24/164526.html&quot;&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; you're reading right now, you'll &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/theMeta.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; a &quot;twitter:body&quot; meta element in the header. Its content attribute is a base64-encoded markdown version of the post. There's a minimal amount of HTML in the post for basic features that markdown can't do. It's something Twitter could experiment with right now, if there's a developer there who thinks this is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Of course this data is there for any other curious developer who wants to play with the idea. That's kind of how RSS got bootstrapped between 1997 and 1999. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Wanting to want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid I had so many material desires, so many things that cost money that wouldâ€™ve given me pleasure. Mostly stereo and sports equipment. I didnâ€™t have any money. Now I could buy anything that I want. But thereâ€™s nothing money can buy that I want.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As has been pointed out elsewhere there are exceptions to this rule. I want a hot tub. For whatever reason I can't seem to get the things I need together to get it installed. When I get one, I will say publicly, probably on my blog and elsewhere, that I've wanted my own hot tub since I left Calif in 2003 and that it's insane that something so good for the human body is so hard to get access to outside the home. There are, in Calif, hot tub places in every town, like bowling alleys. In the east, they just don't have them. Someone should go into that business, I bet it would boom, and would help people in the east relax (not sure if that'd be a good thing or not).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the rule. When I shop on Amazon I can't find anything I want the way I wanted things when I was a kid looking through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.searsarchives.com/catalogs/history.htm&quot;&gt;Sears catalog&lt;/a&gt;. But there &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; things I wanted like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Sign-Fiber-Tipped-Black-S520/dp/B00006IFJL/ref=asc_df_B00006IFJL/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=167123392997&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13295402309173569244&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-138272589675&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Pentel Sign Pens&lt;/a&gt;, but as soon as they got them on Amazon I basically bought a lifetime supply and gifted them to a few of my friends. Of course now my once gorgeous handwriting has devolved into barely readable scratches. I almost never write by hand, maybe to address an envelope, or write a greeting card. So even Pentel Sign Pens don't bring me joy. BTW, if you've never gotten a Pentel Sign Pen they truly are wonderful. Even for adults, but as a kid, they were magnificent. I wonder if kids today have to write by hand? Hmmm. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, when I got all the boxes out of storage from Berkeley I got to go through my childhood a bit. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/gradeSchoolNotebookPage.png&quot;&gt;first page&lt;/a&gt; of a notebook, either first or second grade, probably second. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a process at work here that I'm just beginning to understand. When I was a kid, I had a small immediate family and a very large secondary family. My paternal grandfather had twelve siblings and most of them had relocated to NYC during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II&quot;&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt;. So my mother had a huge number of cousins, and some of them were close. A bunch of them lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5736302,-73.8634738,3a,75y,77.25h,88.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZ0iOyYfCNhPDuAIv25OiaA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Rockaway&lt;/a&gt; where my grandparents lived. But that was 50 years ago. They're all gone now, and the bonds didn't extend into the next generation. So I have a very tiny remnant of a family now. I seek friendships that can take their place, but truth is they can't. I'd pay a lot if I could buy another weekend with the relatives who are gone, even the ones who drove me crazy, but alas that is not for sale anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Though I didn't realize it as I was writing this piece, it's one of the big threads of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/23.html#a120326&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There are, in Calif, hot tub places in every town, like bowling alleys. In the east, they just don't have them.

			<description>Last night was the final episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. One word review -- masterful. Lots to think about. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/mr-robot-series-finale-recap-season-4-episode-12-and-13.html&quot;&gt;Vulture synopsis&lt;/a&gt; is great, obviously it's entirely spoilers, as is this post. The big question of this episode and the entire series it turns out is &lt;i&gt;Who Is The Real Elliot?&lt;/i&gt; For that I got the same answer Time had for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)&quot;&gt;POTY in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. We're all Elliot, having constructed more agreeable versions of ourselves to share with the world, hiding who we are many levels deep, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. It's recursive, Mr Robot says. You wake from one dream to find yourself in another and another. I imagine many people will dislike the end, the same way they didn't like the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the story is real, some of it matters, but in the end not much actually changed. Mr Robot asks us to look at ourselves and our families and friends, and how much of it is what we wish it were, vs how much is as it actually is. There isn't anything unique in this story, it's really the story of our lives, waking up from the dream we concocted to get through childhood. Endings to stories are hard, the art is in where they leave you and how much they change you, and the ending of Mr Robot scores high on all counts.</description>

			<description>How to make corned beef hash. It's incredibly simple. Boil some potatoes the night before. Drain the water, add a bit of vinegar, let sit, covered, overnight. In the morning, chop some corned beef, fry it alone (without potatoes). When nice and brown, put the beef on a plate, leaving the pan greased with fat from the beef. Chop an onion, fry it, then add some chopped potatoes. Then mix the two and fry together. You can add garlic if you like. Mix it up, then remove the hash and fry a couple of eggs in the same pan and serve them on top of the mound of CBH. There's really nothing to it but boiling and frying, but it's really tasty.</description>

			<title>Working with Manila</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the XML-RPC site work, I want to statically rebuild the site from the Frontier object database containing all the content as a Manila site. I have copies of manila.root and xmlRpc.root. I have gotten it to build a static site that appears ready to be built by the Frontier website framework. Now if I can only remember how to build one of those.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;at the docs&lt;/a&gt;, and for the life of me I can't find a simple explanation of how to actually build a site, which is odd because that's what the docs purport to be about. Back then we didn't do a Hello World for this problem, that helps to put the stuff you need to know first up front. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/menus/web.html&quot;&gt;Web menu&lt;/a&gt; is tantalizing but it doesn't appear to have a command that builds a whole site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
