			<description>After many attempts, I'm now rolling on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Expanse&lt;/a&gt;. In the middle of season 2, I more or less understand who the characters are and the plot. I don't know why it took so many tries to get it. &lt;span class=&quot;spSpoiler&quot;&gt;I am sure that Julie Mao and Miller are melding into some kind of incredible love monster whose body is the planet of Venus. I also think their meeting was the sexiest thing I've seen on TV ever&lt;/span&gt;.</description>

If you haven't seen The Expanse and think you might, you should avert your eyes at the right moment in this video. &lt;i&gt;Sorry! &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Wonder if they're testing people at the White House. What are the chances that it's a hot spot for transmission? Lots of people coming and going.</description>

			<description>So many forbidden topics on Twitter, might lead you to believe no one is offended by your ideas (assuming you're politically correct) but voting is private which provides a channel for anger and resentment. Might be a good idea to factor that in.</description>

			<title>My father apologized</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something really weird happened in a dream last night.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My father apologized for something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's been dead since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He never apologized for anything to anyone as far as I recall, certainly not to me. He said and did plenty he should have apologized for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think in a weird way this is my subconscious telling me that it's ready to forgive him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the dream I felt so safe and secure in the moment, I said genuinely, don't worry about it, we can fix the problem right now. Then we went to the post office and I mailed a package to someone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A few years ago I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/08/theWorldIsSocialistPartIi.html&quot;&gt;Health care is socialist&lt;/a&gt;, about health insurance. But I didn't consider this. If there's a lethal virus going around, and we want to slow it down, we need to know where it is. That's the first thing. We have to test lots of people as they are in South Korea. I suppose we could require that people pay for their own tests, but that's just a tax. We might as well simplify the accounting and pay for the testing with tax dollars. It's the same thing. So when Repubs say it would be bad to make health care socialist, they're tricking you. It already is socialist. They just want to siphon off a fat chunk of the health care money for themselves, for doing nothing.</description>

			<description>Two things to watch out for re the virus. 1. There will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy&quot;&gt;anti-vaxer&lt;/a&gt; types who will say the test gives you the disease, so a fair number of people will refuse to be tested. 2. The government will realize that they need to control the press to control the flow of info about the virus. Best to think about it in case it happens. People who read this blog might be the people who figure out how to distribute info even if the government is trying to stop it. Probably will be easier to do before the press is controlled.</description>

			<description>Voter suppression is a philosophical crime. In the US we have a rule -- one person, one vote. So from a voting standpoint, state govt officials have as much say as any other voter. One vote. That's it. But they're trying to make their vote more powerful by preventing yours.</description>

			<title>Cancel culture</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was at dinner with friends last week and the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22cancel+culture%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;cancel culture&lt;/a&gt; came up. Some of them were not familiar with what it is. I promised to try to explain here on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emptywheel.net/2020/02/19/what-happens-after-youre-cancelled/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Norton&quot;&gt;Quinn Norton&lt;/a&gt; about getting cancelled. Briefly, she had gotten a plum job on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/opinion/editorialboard.html&quot;&gt;Editorial Board&lt;/a&gt; of the NY Times, but then when the appointment was announced, controversial tweets she had retweeted (according to her account) surfaced.  The Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/business/media/quinn-norton-new-york-times.html&quot;&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; the offer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a public presence on the net is subject to cancellation. I have had people trying to get me fired for my public writing since the early 90s, when someone called UserLand's office to try to get me fired for my not-sufficiently-Apple-loyal posts on AppleLink. Since then, it's happened many times. The pressure to conform is one of the reasons I deliberately lowered my online profile in the early 2000s after coming pretty close to dying, at least in part from the stress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/28/214733.html?title=whyWarrenFreaksMeOut#a214754&quot;&gt;Warren&lt;/a&gt; attacked Bloomberg on stage at the Democratic debate, she was trying to get him cancelled, and presumably to gain notoriety for herself for being the one who did the cancelling. So cancel culture has arrived at the highest level of US politics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
