			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/17/docCastThursday.mp3&quot;&gt;Doc's podcast for the day&lt;/a&gt;. This time he has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/f6&quot;&gt;public outline&lt;/a&gt; with notes. I'm going to do some work on the outline reader. Creating a groove. I updated the outline reader software to hot-up his links, to make it a bit more readable on a big screen, and a lot more readable on mobile devices. It's been a long time since I touched that code, I actually had a hard time finding it.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üòÑ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If I ask you to post something you wrote on Facebook on your blog, so I can point to it, it's because I thought you said something interesting, and I'd like to share it through my blog and feed, but I can't share Facebook posts outside of Facebook. I have a rule about that, and I rarely break the rule. Lots of reasons for it.</description>

			<description>I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jojo-rabbit&quot;&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, even though it got mixed reviews. You start out wondering what the hell they're doing, but in the end it's a good simple little story that has a lot of meaning. A sort of lite version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Handmaid's Tale&lt;/a&gt;. I really liked that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Wilson&quot;&gt;Rebel Wilson&lt;/a&gt; was in it, a good fit, as was the chief Gestapo guy, and Jojo's best friend. What's not to like?</description>

			<description>I must've done something terribly wrong because there's a symposium in NYC in February about how to keep the silos from taking ownership of podcasting, and I don't know any of the speakers. How are we ever going to get anywhere if we don't work together? Oy.</description>

			<description>Neat new trick in my blog. When I generate links to titled posts, I put the title in the link, after the question mark in the URL. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/11/180743.html?title=naughtonOnFacebook&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;. The browser ignores it, as does the JavaScript code in the page. It's there to provide a human-readable title for the post. You might ask, why not just make the title the link? We did that, for many years, but then you couldn't change the title, or the URL would get out of sync with the title. It's more honest imho to just give each post a URL that is not a function of the title. But it's still nice to have the title present. So there you go, a neat solution and an honorable tradeoff.</description>

			<title>Bagels</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking as an authority on the subject of bagels, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/nyregion/bagel-ny-toasted-de-blasio.html&quot;&gt;toasted&lt;/a&gt; bagel. In fact unless I'm eating a freshly baked bagel, and that's pretty rare these days, I toast them. The warmth of toasting brings out some of the flavor of the bagel when it was fresh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However I cannot sanction whole wheat bagels. Why? Bagels are not hippie food. Sesame, onion, everything, these are my go-to flavors. The only thing worse than whole wheat is a cinnamon raisin breakfast bagel. Please. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My favorite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utopiabagelsofnewyork.com/menu&quot;&gt;bagel place&lt;/a&gt; is on Utopia Parkway in Whitestone, near where I grew up in Flushing. Neighborhood bagel stores are best. I've tried all the famous supposedly best bagels in NYC and imho they aren't bagels, they have more in common with loaves of bread. A bagel shouldn't be so large. Worst offender -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ess-a-bagel.com/&quot;&gt;Ess-A-Bagel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Give me a fresh bagel with cream cheese and lox and maybe a slice of cucumber and bit of onion, capers on the side, with a cup of fresh coffee and Uncle Davey is a happy camper. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I don't mind vacuous platitudes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain&quot;&gt;Wilt Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;. My first winter in the country. There was no 3-point play when WC was playing. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HP9nKbzQDE&quot;&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; James Harden 3-pointer. If you shove the microphone into someone's face they don't have time to get nervous. Maps. I loved maps when I was a kid, and miss them terribly because of iPhones. Hillary's Emails and how the know-how of literally millions of people didn't influence journalism. Any one of these people could have helped, but journalism somehow didn't figure it out. Why can't universities do things? University is a 7-by-24 conference center. &lt;a href=&quot;#a152833&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;. Alex Jones and Shorenstein. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;speaker&lt;/a&gt; whose name I couldn't remember was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling&quot;&gt;Bruce Sterling&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I finished watching all three seasons of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Fargo TV series&lt;/a&gt;. I can't recommend it highly enough. I started to talk about it in the podcast coming out later today, but didn't finish the analogy. The hottest place in the US is always &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/weather-and-climate.htm&quot;&gt;Death Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Every day. So when they report the highest temperature on weather reports, they're telling you the place with the second highest temperature because it would just get boring to always say Death Valley. I think that may be how it works for TV series. Fargo is the best, hands down, nothing compares. It's incredibly funny the way Quentin Taratino movies are, or Itchy and Scratchy, it's filled with Easter eggs, and until you watch it twice (at least) you won't see the connections between the characters. For example, in Season 1, two of the main characters were also in Season 2, but it took place 25 years earlier. And there are echoes of the Fargo movie. So I often say The Wire is the best. What I really mean is it's second best. Fargo is, until further notice, the best thing on TV.</description>

			<description>Every once in a while I put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217803526564347904&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that gets forwarded a lot. This might be one of them. Trump has always reminded me of famous Jewish comedians. He borrows bits from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers&quot;&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217803526564347904&quot;&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt; reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, with his self-deprecating humor. He talks about his hair as being magnificent. Everyone in the room must realize his hair is bizarre and ugly. He'd look a lot better if he just got a normal haircut for a bald 73-year-old guy. What does he see when he looks in the mirror? Does he still see the young Donald, or does he see the old fool the rest of us see. Of course the press helps sell his buffoonery. It's our way of laughing at ourselves. Look what the great USA has been reduced to. We used to see ourselves as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam&quot;&gt;Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt;, now we look in the mirror and see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_the_Clown&quot;&gt;Bozo the Clown&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>With all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/sexist-myth-sanders-warren-female-president-spat.html&quot;&gt;michegas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2020/01/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-sexism.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; Bernie and Warren, here's what I think. My friends, they're both perfectly awful choices for president. Bernie is still living in the 60s. He has no ideas about the world as it exists today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217116064158560256&quot;&gt;Ask him&lt;/a&gt;. Second, Warren is a Harvard professor. She's not of the people. She's more comfortable in the faculty lunchroom, making snide jokes about the little people. They're both incredibly terrible choices to run the country starting in 2021. Neither will get done what they say they will, that will require team-building skills which neither have, and compromise, which means you have to listen. Even Obama, a relatively young person, was totally unprepared to deal with foreign hacking of our election. There's a reason Bernie doesn't have any apps on his phone. I bet he doesn't know what an app is or what the capabilities of mobile devices are. If he did, I think he'd be screaming about it in the special way Bernie screams. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üöÄ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="With all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/sexist-myth-sanders-warren-female-president-spat.html&quot;&gt;michegas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2020/01/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-sexism.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; Bernie and Warren, here's what I think. My friends, they're both perfectly awful choices for president. Bernie is still living in the 60s. He has no ideas about the world as it exists today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217116064158560256&quot;&gt;Ask him&lt;/a&gt;. Second, Warren is a Harvard professor. She's not of the people. She's more comfortable in the faculty lunchroom, making snide jokes about the little people. They're both incredibly terrible choices to run the country starting in 2021. Neither will get done what they say they will, that will require team-building skills which neither have, and compromise, which means you have to listen. Even Obama, a relatively young person, was totally unprepared to deal with foreign hacking of our election. There's a reason Bernie doesn't have any apps on his phone. I bet he doesn't know what an app is or what the capabilities of mobile devices are. If he did, I think he'd be screaming about it in the special way Bernie screams. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üöÄ&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:39:23 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/21/ourDemocracyHasBeenHacked.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/01/14.html#a153923"/>

			<description>If you look at it as if you were hiring someone to put the country back together after the Trump combination heart attack, stroke, colon cancer, head-on car crash, you'd want someone who has gotten shit done. Who would see the problems we have now as interesting challenges. Would know who wants what in exchange for the things we need to do. Someone with a rolodex of effective people. Neither Warren or Sanders have the ability to do any of that. Elect them and at best you get a Jimmy Carter. I don't mean weak, the way the Repubs do, I mean having no idea how to get things done in Washington, and therefore proceeding to get nothing done.</description>

			<description>On Sunday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/12/155518.html?title=theImpentetrableShorenstein&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about the walls journalism puts up to keep the rest of us only speaking in the aggregate, to all our detriment imho. There are experts all over the place, who can provide fresh perspectives on the news, to engage people's minds, and set examples for creative approaches. I lamented that even though there is a former outstanding blogger running &lt;a href=&quot;https://shorensteincenter.org/&quot;&gt;Shorenstein&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading university think tanks for journalism, the walls remain, and we're no closer to fulfilling the opportunities created in the early web. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nicco-mele&quot;&gt;Nicco Mele&lt;/a&gt;, the blogger I was referring to, is no longer in charge of Shorenstein. I was so-advised by two former colleagues. I'm &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; out of the loop, that's for sure. Anyway, the new director is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nancy-gibbs?_ga=2.187920296.1420702108.1579015693-1352129629.1577806700&quot;&gt;Nancy Gibbs&lt;/a&gt;. Best of luck and please let me know if there's any way I can help. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you're working in Node.js and need to generate an RSS feed, you're welcome to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daverss&quot;&gt;the package&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for use in all my apps. Follow the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/rss/blob/master/examples/app/test.js&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea how it works. Just create two simple JavaScript objects, and call rss.buildRssFeed, and it creates a valid RSS 2.0 feed. It's really solid, burned in and tested in a wide variety of readers and aggregators. Variants of this code have been generating RSS feeds since (oy) 1999.</description>

This is an interesting medium because unlike other podcasts I've listened to Doc on, in this mode he gets to talk as long as he wants and can pause, and say whatever you want. Anyway I've decided I'm going to build a basketball court so when you visit we can meditate over shooting hoops. Anyway. Focus is the thing. Creating a groove. And making each other more powerful. That's going to be my next chapter. I do want to hear about your experience with Medium. We all have our own stories. I also want to tell you a story about Dave Bunnell. And why walking is the best.</description>

			<description>The next president should be creating a new social net for governance that involves all the voters who want to be involved. American citizens of voting age only. Doing real things to make America work better in every way, especially politically. I wrote this idea up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/21/theWhiteHouseWebsite.html&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; as Obama took office and didn't follow through on the promise (imho) of his campaign. Sanders is a nice guy for sure, but he can't do the organizing we need to do (see &lt;a href=&quot;#a180053&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;). It's not something you can delegate. I think Bloomberg may get this, but I'm not sure. The politicians running for office are still very old school, and Sanders is the oldest of them.</description>

			<description>I tuned in a bit of CNN and NBC yesterday, they were obsessing about the president's offhand claim/lie that he thought there were four embassies being targeted by the assassinated Iranian general. By now they should know Trump-speak. When he says he &quot;thinks&quot; something that means he made it up. What's the point in wasting so much time on it, when everyone with a mind understands exactly what he was saying.</description>

			<description>I'm having the best time writing my blog these days. What makes the difference? You. I play my blog the way a musician plays the piano or guitar. I can hear what I play, but I'm most interested in what you hear. I'm not running &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;McDonalds&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;, I've got a little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-mud-club-woodstock-2&quot;&gt;coffee shop&lt;/a&gt; in town. I serve the drinks, tell stories, decorate the place, choose the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; and lighting, bring in guests, all to pass the time in the most Dave-friendly way I can. I look for others doing their own things, so we can perform together. Our ideas influence, are tested and improved on. I'm back in the 90s and all of a sudden there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/01/13/ahugechunkofbluesky.html&quot;&gt;blue sky&lt;/a&gt; in every direction. All because, imho, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to be myself again. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Andrew Shell opens a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrewshell/status/1216370917225517056&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;, an iOS podcast client, asking why he was unable to subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out Overcast doesn't like titleless posts. I don't use Overcast myself, so I can't offer specific advice, but it is not acceptable to use the file name as a title. That's not what the file name is for. I described the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216404689719365634&quot;&gt;use-case&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet (of course without a title, tweets don't have titles). Vendors tend to ignore advice on these issues, and that's kept us from growing. I used to budge for them on this issue, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;decided in 2017&lt;/a&gt; to stop. All the compromises meant that my blog disappears. Bottom-line: I put podcasts on title-less posts. &lt;i&gt;That's never going to change. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<title>Journalists: We are not you</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On this day four years ago the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/12/0848.html&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; of bloggers wanting to replace reporters came up again. This was yet another colossal misunderstanding, much like the disconnect re Facebook today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We, bloggers, seem to always be trying to assuage journalists' fear of us. That really shoudn't be necessary, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar: How refreshing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bensmith/iran-war-twitter&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt;, editor in chief at Buzzfeed News, refers to the &quot;the enduring positive qualities of social media.&quot; I wonder if his colleagues at Buzzfeed and other pubs tuned into that. How about a series of columns, updated to 2020 reality, that explore those positive qualities, to balance all the horror stories running in the NYT and elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I observe that journalists tend be blind when it comes to voters, users, writers, developers, anyone but politicians, rich people, and other journalists. We hardly exist as individuals, we're only considered in the aggregate (polls and the like). They shrink their world, furiously, so they can deal with it. Huge disconnects result. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This cartoon ran at the DNC in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html&quot;&gt;ISOJ&lt;/a&gt; in April last year, I described the above cartoon. I was one of the bloggers. Of course it hurt my feelings, it was intended to, although some people think it was done with irony. I personally don't buy that. YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bloggers don't usually wave their credentials in your face, so you might not be aware that many of us at the DNC in 2004 actually had decent credentials. For example, I had a good education from good schools. At the time I was a research fellow at Harvard. I had spent decades proving myself in my field and had risen to the top. I invented a bunch of technology that were in very wide use, and would form the foundation for all computer networking to come. I had been writing my blog for nine years at that point, and if I do say so myself, was a good writer. We were in the process of starting podcasting at the time. And I was just one of the DNC bloggers. The others were just as accomplished. You had to be someone special to be at the DNC in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A request for ambitious truth-seeking journalists -- stop writing from your fear, learn more about the world. Your blind spots are huge, and are killing us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The impentetrable Shorenstein</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Harvard, when I was a fellow there, one of the members of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/bloggroup/&quot;&gt;Berkman Thursday&lt;/a&gt; group was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_MacKinnon&quot;&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, who was a fellow at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorenstein_Center_on_Media,_Politics_and_Public_Policy&quot;&gt;Shorenstein Center&lt;/a&gt;, which was the rough equivalent of Berkman but for journalists. Previously she had been a CNN reporter from Beijing and Tokyo. Her fellowship was a turning point in her career. She went on to start &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalvoices.org/&quot;&gt;Global Voices&lt;/a&gt;, a blogging network, among other pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She got me together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a former NYT reporter, who was then the director of Shorenstein. To say he was blog-skeptical would be an understatement. He typified all the arrogance and fear of blogging in journalism, with what I saw as false confidence, bravado, I guessed, to try to keep me, and what I represented to him, at arm's length. We probably met just twice, maybe even once. I remember a contentious somewhat friendly conversation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henriettastable.com/&quot;&gt;Henrietta's Table&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I personally asked Jones to come to the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;. He came. I watched him and joined in conversations with him at times. He appeared to be having the time of his life. And why shouldn't he? Here was a room full of sources, people who knew about something he was actually very interested in, and they didn't have to be coerced into talking about it. There was a ton of enthusiasm in the room. They were exploding with ideas, because of the huge potential of this space in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But after the BloggerCon we went back to our corners, staring at each other, unsure of how to communicate. By now &lt;a href=&quot;https://shorensteincenter.org/alex-jones-leave-shorenstein-center-july-1-2015/&quot;&gt;Jones has retired&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicco_Mele&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; is a former famous blogger, the guy who did the blogging at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_for_America&quot;&gt;Dean campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2004/02/07/howardDeanIsNotASoapBar.html&quot;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, really breakthrough stuff, and yet nothing has changed. Shorenstein is still a bastion of professional journalism, and ideas from blogging don't penetrate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should all be working together. I said it then, keep pounding the table, beating the drum. No reason to stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
