			<title>Working together, in 2019</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I listen to an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; I feel like writing an email to Chris Lydon and Mary McGrath, saying basically this. Everything your guests say is right on. I get so excited listening to them, they're so smart. But I want to add something, that the technology you're using contains the answer to the most basic problems they're talking about.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened again today on my way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport&quot;&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt;, riding on the E train to the Airtrain to Terminal 5. It was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/post-democracy-in-america/&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; about democracy from December 2016. Not sure how it ended up on my iPhone, but there it was, so I listened. The first guest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Lepore&quot;&gt;Jill Lepore&lt;/a&gt;, had been to the 2016 election postmortem &lt;a href=&quot;https://iop.harvard.edu/get-inspired/campaign-managers-conference/campaign-president-managers-look-2016&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; probably at Shorenstein, where the campaign managers of the major campaigns, 17 Repubs and 3 Dems talked about what worked and what didn't. Not one of them understood, she said (and I agreed), the underlying theme of the election, income inequality, but I believe the answer is deeper. Here's what I see. The world is going to hell, and I'm powerless to do anything about it. My life has no meaning. I want to make a difference but I can't. And the people who can are only thinking about furthering their own careers, not of the big picture. Here it is 2019 and still only a few people see the answer isn't any one of us, it's all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second guest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Mattei&quot;&gt;Ugo Mattei&lt;/a&gt;, a professor from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin&quot;&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt; (where I visited last summer!) got even closer, he said the magic words. He said the secret is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/30/122337.html&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt;. This is my mission. Ultimately that's going to be the way we dig out. That's the real 21st century revolution. Everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22working+together%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; in that direction. Working. Together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lepore also talks about how technology has been a distraction for the Democrats, offering to turn people into &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+slurry&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, and I cheered when I heard that. Of course tech is where I come from, but I went in a radically different direction from Zuck and Bezos. I see technology as empowering us all to take charge of journalism, the same way the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indivisible_movement&quot;&gt;indivisible movement&lt;/a&gt; empowered us to reform politics. You can't have one without the other. Most important we have to stop thinking of journalism as a way for a small number of people to earn a living and do a lousy job of serving the people's interest, and more of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/13/ideaAnIndivisibleGuideForJournalism.html&quot;&gt;civic calling&lt;/a&gt;, a way for all of us to add meaning to each others' lives. Until we get there, we'll keep electing losers like Trump and getting no further in solving the climate and social crises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to shake Chris and say hey you're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message&quot;&gt;doing it&lt;/a&gt;. The elites you talk with, the ones you choose, they get it. Now we just have to put this in practice. We're not getting any younger. Time is running out for our species. You just have to listen to Radio Open Source to hear that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I know I'm rambling. I'm excited. I believe in our future if we can get beyond our individual self-interest and start thinking and acting collectively. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The indivisible movement used the tools of technology, as does Chris's podcast. Remember that when you think tech created the problems, it did. But it also is empowering the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm having an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://scripting.com/2018/12/30/124007.html#annotations:eGxEYg1ZEemlC1Pk-PD_kg&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; with longtime friend Jon Udell, but I think we're discussing different things. I'm trying to say we don't have a good way to explain features in languages and environments to people who aren't schooled in the environment. So if I say X has a feature no other environment has, people will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; say it &quot;sounds like&quot; something they've seen in environment A, B and C. But &quot;sounds like&quot; is not good enough. If for example Billy Joel were to claim he had written a great new song, then played it on the piano and it was obviously Hey Jude, you could say Hey Billy that &quot;sounds like&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A_MjCqQoLLA?t=48&quot;&gt;Hey Jude&lt;/a&gt; and you'd have a good idea that you are right. Because music has a universal instrument for sharing tunes, the piano. Software does not. I hoped JavaScript would be it. But maybe it is. I'll try demoing the feature I was talking about in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/30/124007.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; Jon was commenting on, using JavaScript.</description>

			<title>Facebook really is dying</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You know I hate the word &quot;dead&quot; applied to things that were never alive, but in this case I can't think of a better way to say it. Facebook is turning into a ghost town. Here's how I know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite features on Facebook is when they show you every day what you posted there on the same day 1, 2, 3 etc years ago. Through that lens you can see what you were doing on their platform in the past. And these days it's been by far the most interesting thing on Facebook, because for me at least it used to be a vibrant interesting place. Not no more.     &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Caveat: Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One factor in my perception is they shut off my ability to post via their API. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblogging&lt;/a&gt; used to flow through Facebook as it does now through Twitter and RSS. And from that, conversations would grow, leading to other ideas, that led to more posts. But now that that channel is closed off, the activity has moved elsewhere. I understand why they did it, fake news, but it had a cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example in 2017 on this day I posted a comment about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/02/smugPilots.png&quot;&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; that I cribbed from somewhere, with an appeal to understand why people might have voted for Trump, and why it's tragic that we couldn't work together as citizens instead of crashing the country, which is what Trump was going to do and clearly is doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/02/smugPilots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I keep posting everywhere I can to please tell Trump that we're tired of winning as he predicted we would be. Maybe he should retire to Mar-a-lago or Moscow or where ever they'll have him. A low-security Federal prison perhaps? It could be just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQV6CijIzrc&quot;&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's good that Facebook is dying. I do believe in the death penalty for corporations. They have behaved obscenely, without regard for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&quot;&gt;natural resources&lt;/a&gt; that made their company possible. It's as if Exxon could rape the planet without any environmental controls. Not just Facebook -- Google too, and every other tech company, because they're all staffed by the people drawn from the same talent pool. Profits before everything. This is what you get. I don't think the press have fully grokked this yet. They're just nibbling at the edges. Maybe that's all they'll ever do? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_at_Dannemora&quot;&gt;Escape at Dannemora&lt;/a&gt; was worth watching, but it was ungodly slow at times, which I guess is okay because that's how life is in prison, I guess. The Showtime series ended on Sunday.</description>
