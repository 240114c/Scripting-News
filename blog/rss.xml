They deployed to Katrina when my dad and I were the first in St Bernard to arrive. Praying for my friends who volunteer in them. The demand outstripped availability there, and I expect the same as what happened then, that churches will serve the vast majority, since Red Cross/NGOs will be outstripped in capacity as well.&quot;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;ten-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt; I recorded nine days ago, but didn't publish. At the end I say why. Even I thought it was crazy, delusional. Since then however the story proved true. It's why I write and record my thoughts. I want to remember the perspective of events before, during and after they happen. Listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/11.html#a190333&quot;&gt;James Taylor&lt;/a&gt; talk about his music, the one thing he doesn't mention in the long list of roles music plays in our lives is that it brings old memories to the surface. Listening to his songs takes me back to high school, young love, and the wild random and erratic ideas I had as a teen. Writing isn't as strong a stimulus as music, but it's what I do. And podcasting too of course. Story-telling. So much has happened in the last nine days, every one of the upcoming nine days is no doubt going to be equally consequential. We're living out the crazy consequences of believing somehow as if by magic it all would take care of itself. To keep my fears at bay, to feel strong and consequential, I keep in mind what Syrio says to Arya to say to Death: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEhAFgvwS1M&quot;&gt;Not today&lt;/a&gt;. A new motto! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/contagious-crisis/&quot;&gt;must-listen podcast&lt;/a&gt; from Chris Lydon. The take-away is that our political system hasn't yet realized that we need to go to single-payer for all, now, if we want to have as good an outcome as Italy, which is to say a very shitty outcome. Ours is on track to be much worse because the uninsured can't enter the system, therefore will continue to infect even people with insurance. We're set suffer here in the US a lot more. There will be a debate tomorrow night, and if Biden isn't tuned into this, Sanders is going to clean his clock. And I suspect Biden isn't. And there's a chance that Sanders isn't thinking clearly either, but I kind of doubt it. Nothing focuses the mind like losing. Action-item: before the debate, Biden should give a speech outlining a Medicare-for-all-now program. Give Sanders proper credit. At the debate he can offer to delegate the implementation of this to Sanders. Create unity right there on the debate stage. The Democrats in Congress are not without power. Trump is crazy to think the only criteria people will care about is the stock market. People who unnecessarily lose friends and relatives to this disease are likely to care about that more. Never waste a good crisis. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt; is the time to reform health care in the US.</description>

We're on the cusp of getting there. We need each other. Ads on TV are from a different world, one that is gone now. Meaning is here. Helping each other to survive. Can't get more meaningful than that.</description>

			<description>On &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/12.html#a174026&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; I recommended listening to the Daily podcast. They had an interview with NYT reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; who explained how they fought Covid19 in China. He was on Maddow that night, and they posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/1238279302468288512&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of his talk on Twitter. If you haven't seen it, stop everything, now, and watch it. You'll get so much more information about what we're up against. China appears to have beaten it. Ultimately we will have to do the same, if we don't want it to spread to everyone.</description>

			<title>Enoch Choi, on the front line</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enoch Choi is a longtime friend, and a doctor on the front line of treating patients with Covid19. This is copied &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102336167134141&amp;set=a.750918057041&amp;type=3&amp;theater&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; his Facebook timeline. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will be swept by Covid19 deaths without more screening so we can know who to focus care for. Without diagnosis, we fly blind and just wait for those so sick to need hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Without more tests, and possible treatment (high flow nasal oxygen, bipap, intubation, remdesivir, convalescent serum, oya1, steroids) what I have for folks is symptomatic (cough suppressants, fever reducers) which I can recommend over the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Telemedicine needs to ramp up so we can keep folks home and prevent waiting room transmission. Stay home and call your doctor. Donâ€™t come In until you are dying. I can reassure you over the phone. You won't get the swab/test you want unless you are really sick, feverish and a contact of positive Covid19 patient, feverish with severe shortness of breath and chronically ill.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Woodstock notes, day 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers outside &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_County,_New_York&quot;&gt;Ulster County&lt;/a&gt;. I'm going to start posting about my experiences in the area I live now. I think they will be of general interest. There are a number of people locally who read my blog and right now this is the only place I can post them. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hannaford.com/locations/west-hurley-hannaford-21197&quot;&gt;Hannaford's&lt;/a&gt; in West Hurley today. I was pleased to see the parking lot looked fine for a Saturday morning. I got a spot in the second row. Lots of empty spots.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First the general picture. The store is well stocked. Lots of canned goods, pasta, dairy, bottled water, snacks, beer, most everything on my shopping list. Where there were things missing I was able to improvise. The store people were in good spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there was no mistaking we're in a different world now. I could feel this immediately on entering the store. There were empty shelves. Something you don't generally see in America, but you do see in the third world. The produce section was mostly empty. Chicken, hamburger, pork -- mostly gone, what was there were specialty items.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The store is functioning. I had seen people say earlier that it was closed. We have to be careful about that. Before reporting rumors, let's go check it out. That was one of the reasons I went today, to see what was going on. I'm a big believer in people getting the news themselves. This is one of those times when that'll be important.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had to drive to the car dealer today to pick up my car. Along the way, I had many opportunities to pick up the virus. First was when I crossed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston%E2%80%93Rhinecliff_Bridge&quot;&gt;Rhinecliff Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and had to stop to pay a toll. The toll booth operator had gloves on. I gave her six quarters and before continuing, I wiped the hand that touched hers. Her glove was accumulating all the viruses on everyone's hands who paid the toll. At the dealer, I had to sign a form to get my car back. They gave me a pen to use. I had no idea who else had used the pen. They did have hand sanitizer on the desk. I used it. Also thought about stealing it, but didn't. When I got my car, I rubbed down the steering wheel with sanitizer. Forgot to wipe the gear shift or the controls for the heating system, until after I touched them. On the way back I got a car wash. Paid the attendant $12 in cash, and he gave me change, again in cash. I thought about all the people who had touched the bills, including the attendant.</description>

I had no idea who else had used the pen. They did have hand sanitizer on the desk. I used it. Also thought about stealing it, but didn't. When I got my car, I rubbed down the steering wheel with sanitizer. Forgot to wipe the gear shift or the controls for the heating system, until after I touched them. On the way back I got a car wash. Paid the attendant $12 in cash, and he gave me change, again in cash. I thought about all the people who had touched the bills, including the attendant." created="Thu, 12 Mar 2020 17:47:28 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/12/purell.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/12.html#a174728"/>

			<description>I had anxiety about Covid19 for the first time this morning. This could be it. But if it isn't, I have some great software in mind. Funny how being this scared brings out the creativity. On the other hand if this is the time to go -- I'd rather have it be in a plot of a terrible science fiction novel than say going in my sleep. The drama of Trump's speech last night. At one point I thought he was losing it and was going to start talking like Jerry Lewis in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/neEe1itDC_k?t=320&quot;&gt;Nutty Professor&lt;/a&gt;. I think that would have been good for everyone, but he got himself back on track. His eyes are dead. No one home.</description>

			<description>Instead of listening to podcasts about the virus I started listening to a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Break-Shot-First-Years-Memoir/dp/B081D93GP6&quot;&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; today -- James Taylor's memoir. The audiobook is the way to go because he plays his guitar while he's narrating. Many of his famous songs are all autobiographical. And his story is surprising. I didn't know anything about him.
