			<description>As you may know I'm shopping for a car. I'm using a number of car-rating sites, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://consumerreports.org&quot;&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; where I am a member. I wanted to use their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-prices-build-buy-service/index.htm?ep=A37&quot;&gt;pricing service&lt;/a&gt;, but they ask for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/02/10/whatsYourPhoneNumber.png&quot;&gt;phone number&lt;/a&gt; before letting you in. This was a deal-stopper at first, but eventually I relented and entered my number. Immediately I was taken to a screen that said that a dealer would contact me &lt;i&gt;by phone. &lt;/i&gt;No opt out. I was not warned this would happen. I assumed that because this was &lt;a href=&quot;https://carbuying.consumerreports.org/register/?exteriorColorId=952534&amp;viprMakeId=60&amp;viprMakeName=Subaru&amp;viprModelId=8219&amp;viprStyleId=63359&quot;&gt;integrated&lt;/a&gt; with Consumer Reports website that it would treat me, the consumer, fairly. I just got a call from the dealer. I didn't take it. A waste of all our time, but most importantly a waste of CR's rep. They took a big hit here with me. Which sucks because trust is central to the service they sell. [Update: It's turning into a spamfest. The dealer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berterasubaru.com/&quot;&gt;Bertera Subaru&lt;/a&gt;, has called twice, sent three text messages and two emails, so far. Another update. When I asked Andrew Luzio of Bertera to stop spamming me, he responded with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/02/10/moreSpamFromBertera.png&quot;&gt;more spam&lt;/a&gt;.]</description>

			<description>I just completed a binge-watch of all six Sopranos seasons. One thing to note. The last season was awful. It was a total slog to get through all 21 episodes. I kept putting it down it was so bad compared to the other seasons. But the awfulness of the last season makes me think that the contentious ending of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_America_(The_Sopranos)&quot;&gt;last episode&lt;/a&gt; might have just been a punt by a writer's room that had clearly run out of gas. They didn't know how to end the series, so they didn't. BTW one of the great things about having a blog is that I can show you &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/06/11/theSopranosAftermath.html&quot;&gt;what I thought&lt;/a&gt; of the last episode at the time it aired. Basically I wasn't buying it: &quot;The Sopranos was a mess, and it ended in an unsatisfying cop-out.&quot;</description>

			<description>One thing I learned from a week of driving in upstate New York, both Google's and Apple's maps apps go crazy when the phone doesn't have an Internet connection. I had only experienced this kind of insanity once before, when driving in downtown Boston. There the phone doesn't know which level of road you're driving on. The major highways are all underground. This last week the apps kept changing their mind about which direction I should be going on a road. This not only made me miss turns, but it also drove &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; crazy because I never knew if I could rely on their directions.</description>

			<description>Owen Williams' &lt;a href=&quot;https://char.gd/blog/2019/google-news-is-broken/amp?__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;sad tale&lt;/a&gt; of Google News reminds me of the scene in The Godfather where the undertaker Bonasera visits Don Corleone on the day of his daughter's wedding. Bonasera's daughter has been raped. He went to the police, they tried the rapist, but he got off with a suspended sentence. Bonasera seeks justice from the Godfather who gives his first great speech in the movie. &quot;We've known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And you were afraid to be in my debt.&quot; In Williams' tale of woe, the Godfather is the open web, other news orgs, his readers, and the legal system is Google. We have to work together Owen. The web made all you do possible, you can't go over its head to Google to get what you think you need. And though you disparage RSS in your piece, it, or something exactly like it, will be the glue that routes around Google and Facebook and eventually makes networked news work. BTW, the dialog is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Godfather#Dialogue&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and the video clip is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPTAjNVvrYg&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>There was a point in the development of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, after a few VCs invested in startups, that the consensus among them (the founders and the investors) was that RSS was theirs, and they told me to my face they weren't going to listen, because I was the old way, and they were the new. (Famous last words.) Even some people who thought they were friends did this, perhaps not so bluntly. Okay now fast forward, all the startups are gone, they were so stupid they failed for many other reasons, not just their arrogance and closed minds. Stupid people. Here's a better rule. Listen by default. Tech is filled with idiotic arrogance. It's a kind of narcissism. I am the only one who can think. Bullshit. Look at all you're building on. The people who created that not only had an idea, &lt;i&gt;but they were right. &lt;/i&gt;That's a very rare combination. And until you have built something like that, you are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; smarter. And once you have, you know other people are smart, because that's what you learn.</description>

			<description>New York should just buy a team, coaches, players, owner -- the whole thing, and move it into the Garden. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheAthleticNYC/status/1093963720877842432&quot;&gt;other city&lt;/a&gt; can have all the rookies and draft picks. New York is the greatest city in the US. It should have the greatest NBA team. We can afford it. Failing that, if Bloomberg doesn't run for president, could he just fucking buy the Knicks and manage it in an interesting way? I don't know if he's a basketball fan, but somehow I think he &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; do better than Dolan.</description>

			<description>Another idea. I'm staying in a rented house with Internet but no cable. I would like to watch a little news. It would be great if there were a web/app-only news channel, that competed with MSNBC, Fox, CNN, that was fully available over the web or Roku (or the like). It's ridiculous in 2019 that I am shut out from cable-style news just because I haven't paid Spectrum. Do we really still need them? (Note: I do pay them at my apartment in Manhattan, it's not like I'm trying to avoid paying them.)</description>

			<description>An idea for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union&quot;&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;. Why not offer personal membership in the EU to citizens of countries that withdraw from the EU. Benefits might include, they get to keep their EU passport. They can freely move between EU countries as before. They can vote in EU elections. Might lead to something interesting, like a new political party in the withdrawing country?</description>

			<description>Journalism should compete with tech. The tech companies were willing to give equal voice to users. They created a level playing field. Journalism still insists that only pros have a voice. They could create their own journalism platforms and mix things up differently.</description>

As much as we despise and villify the current top dog in tech (Microsoft before FB and Google, btw) we are that, for the world. We are the privileged. We have collectively killed so many countries, millions of people, to maintain our control. We think of ourselves as the country we were taught about in school, but that was a bedtime story.

			<title>Porzingas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Is it worth it being a fan of sports? Yesterday in NYC we learned first that Kristaps Porzingas, our young star, was not convinced that the culture of the Knicks had changed. Then minutes later, rumors of a trade to Dallas, a move that just clears cap space, that doesn't get the Knicks a star that's comparable in any way to the one we're giving up.  A few minutes later the deal is confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a shock. Then after letting it settle in a bit, I realized how much I had looked forward to seeing him blossom as a Knick. That all the young players the team was accumulating and developing were his team to lead, and it wasn't good enough for him. After a few years of him saying how much he loved New York, he goes to Dallas of all places, because they have a player there he'd like to play with.

				<source:outline text="Is it worth it being a fan of sports? Yesterday in NYC we learned first that Kristaps Porzingas, our young star, was not convinced that the culture of the Knicks had changed. Then minutes later, rumors of a trade to Dallas, a move that just clears cap space, that doesn't get the Knicks a star that's comparable in any way to the one we're giving up.  A few minutes later the deal is confirmed." created="Fri, 01 Feb 2019 13:21:26 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/15/kristaps.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/02/01/131639.html#a132126"/>

			<title>I wrote this for a friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015 a friend was going through a tough time. The bottom had dropped out of his tech industry life. It had happened to me. I gave him the advice that worked for me, that helped me go on after my dreams of grandeur had been revealed to be foolish. I posted it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/887204091486997?notif_id=1549026273419642&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for some reason, which proves I guess that despite what so many say, it has or at least had a purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a friend who's going thru a familiar struggle. I have some advice that's imho worth sharing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Go some place natural. Alone. Where no one knows you or who you know. Subtract everything that defines you as a pundit or friend of the rich and famous. No gadgets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Swim. Get massaged. Try being quiet. Talk about your childhood. Find yourself, the person you've been hiding from.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Just be another random person, one of seven billion, because that is the truth. That is who you are. Who I am. Who everyone is. When you really feel it a weight comes off. None of this shit matters.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
