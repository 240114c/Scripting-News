			<description>I've heard it said in the news that the virus is &quot;peaking&quot; in the US. Pretty sure that's not true. It &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; be peaking on its first go-around in NYC, but elsewhere it's just ramping up.</description>

			<description>I remember how hard it was to stop smoking in the years before I actually did. I would make a little progress, and feel okay I can have one now, I've been good, and then I go right back to two packs a day. Getting rid of the virus is going to be like that. Just when we feel like we have it licked is when you have to double-down on the commitment. It's so easy to let up, relax. And go back to the thing that was killing you.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/08/22.html#When:5:05:41PM&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Tomorrow is Day 70 of No Smoking Dave. Ten weeks. A non-smoking story at the Bowie concert last week. As I'm walking out I see people lighting up everywhere. Smell of smoke all around. It smells good. I really want one. In my mind I outline the steps it would take to be smoking and the amount of time it would take. I would ask someone if they could spare a cigarette. If they said no I'd offer them $1. Oh hell, just offer $1 to begin with. Whoo, where would I get a match. I'd ask for a light. Take a drag. Estimated time, 15 seconds to one minute to first nicotine rush. My heart started beating faster. I felt scared like you feel on a NY subway platform as a train is entering the station and you're standing on the platform and in the instant before it passes you think how you could end your life by leaning forward.&quot;</description>

			<description>Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amazon/status/1248094415752749059&quot;&gt;Jeff Bezos visited&lt;/a&gt; an Amazon warehouse and a Whole Foods supermarket. The video would have been hard to anticipate just a few weeks ago. Why is he walking around like that, alone, not shaking anyone's hand. If that were a scene in a movie it would win an award. Foreboding. Ominous. Weird.</description>

			<description>A couple of months ago it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/08.html#a184531&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to bug me that I didn't have a DVR for my TV, haven't had one since I gave up my TiVO when I left Massachusetts in 2004. Now my cable setup is Spectrum, because that's the only cable supplier where I live, and their TV package, including HBO, Showtime, and the rest of the stuff. I used it mainly for HBO, MSNBC, Law &amp; Order and the occasional Knicks game. I set out on a quest for an alternative, and the best I came up with is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; which I am now subscribed to. The other choice was Hulu, which I have used and liked. Not sure which is better. Anyway, I got my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder&quot;&gt;DVR&lt;/a&gt;, so I can watch last night's Maddow when &lt;i&gt;The Trump Show&lt;/i&gt; is on in the early evening. And I don't need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insider.com/when-sports-return-from-coronavirus-hiatus-nba-mlb-nhl-2020-3&quot;&gt;sports&lt;/a&gt;, because there aren't any. And I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://channelstore.roku.com/details/8378/hbo-go&quot;&gt;HBO app&lt;/a&gt;, along with Netflix and Amazon. It's a good setup.</description>

			<description>The Fake Friends of Facebook are getting so freaking obvious and numerous. Every day I get ten or twenty friend requests from &quot;people&quot; who are obviously made-up. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/09/fakeFriendRequestsOnFacebook.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of some of them. I'm amazed Facebook's algorithm can't filter these.</description>

			<title>Biden can make a difference now</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Biden can assemble a panel of scientists and medical doctors to keep the public informed. An hour a day, press conference style. What the CDC would be doing if Trump weren't president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And he (Biden) would step back, an example for what Trump should do. Let the doctors and the military manage it. Stop campaigning while thousands of Americans are dying. Biden wouldn't even have to say it. It would make Trump look immediately tone deaf which he most certainly is.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea so appealing right now is that the governors are linking up and sharing resources. Someone should be providing the science for them. The government is failing. But there's plenty of unused talent out there, it just needs to be managed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another reason -- it would mean that in order to compete, Trump would not only have to enable his scientists, he would also have to start using the US government money as it must be used, not for whatever bullshit he has planned. If he doesn't why should anyone listen to him? By giving him TV power the networks have made it unnecessary for him to use the government's economic and military power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We will watch movies of beautiful happy people in social settings with other beautiful happy people, exchanging in-person conversation, experiencing exotic smells and waves of oxytocin. Multitudes of beautiful, interesting and happy people wander by, exchanging knowing glances and suggestive smiles. No one is wearing a mask. Their faces are literally naked. In public. Naked.

			<description>When I sit down at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1115239756974174208&quot;&gt;lovely dinner&lt;/a&gt;, with interesting, humor-filled friends in a beautiful spot, I am as rich as I can possibly be. A billionaire couldn't have more. I first realized this at a sushi restaurant in Sausalito, where the chef had prepared the most amazing looking and tasting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1115618047757254656&quot;&gt;bouquet&lt;/a&gt; of fresh fish and rice.

			<description>I'd like to see one of the cable channels continue their regular broadcast without airing The Trump Show every night. It's very bad for our country, in the spirit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE&quot;&gt;Jon Stewart's appeal&lt;/a&gt; to the Crossfire guys so many years ago. They never did help us, and now &lt;i&gt;thousands of Americans are dying. &lt;/i&gt;What will it take to wake the owners of the networks up. And the people, why are you watching this deadly animal garbage? Don't you get it? If you didn't watch they wouldn't broadcast. Don't you care about your own lives?</description>

			<description>When I edited yesterday's piece about my grandfather &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/06/152004.html?title=rudyKiesler&quot;&gt;Rudy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;, I stumbled across a reference to him as a &quot;German Jewish communist,&quot; on a page about &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimili.com/en/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, who was my grandmother's brother, Rudy's brother-in-law, my mother's uncle and my great uncle. I thought that was super interesting. Because if you met Rudy you'd have thought he was a Republican, at least today you would. But he wasn't at all. He was super liberal. Our whole family was. It never occurred to me that he was a communist, but he might have been, esp from the point of view of Uncle Arno (who I never actually met).</description>

			<description>Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rudykiesler.com/&quot;&gt;Rudy's&lt;/a&gt; company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.b340.com/&quot;&gt;United Pioneer&lt;/a&gt;, still exists. Apparently Salant shut it down when they went bankrupt in the 80s, they must have sold the name to Bernie Braverman, who worked for Rudy. I remember him, since I worked in the office one summer (the summer of the Watergate hearings). United Pioneer, amazingly, still exists, but they wrote Rudy Kiesler out of the story. I've seen this happen many times, even with my own work. It must run in the family. Anyway the web is amazing, the trails are there for all of this, you just have to look, and now this is part of the story too.</description>

			<title>Rudy Kiesler</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My maternal grandfather, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rudykiesler.com/&quot;&gt;Rudy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;, was a bundle of energy. Highly opinionated. Very loud. Didn't spend a lot of time thinking (or so it seemed to me as a child) he just burst into action. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was the 13th of 13 children, born in the land between Poland and Germany, sent off to fend for himself as a very young boy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jewish, he was deported in the first rounds of the Nazi regime, leaving my grandmother and mother behind. Lucie, my grandmother, was Lutheran, blonde-haired, blue-eyed Aryan princess. Why they married is something I never understood. They didn't seem to have anything in common.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the women were left in Germany or Czechoslavakia, I'm not clear on which, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+rudy+kiesler&amp;t=hy&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Rudy K&lt;/a&gt; was in Brooklyn or Queens, setting up a garment business, which he ran until he had a stroke in the 1970s. With no heir wanting to inherit the business, he sold the company, United Pioneer, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/53/Salant-Corporation.html&quot;&gt;Salant &amp; Salant&lt;/a&gt;. But he was always a bundle of energy, until he drifted away in a nursing home and died in the early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He would not have liked this &quot;stay home stay safe&quot; thing. I can't imagine he would have done it. He was the kind of guy who couldn't stand to wait in a line at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair&quot;&gt;World's Fair&lt;/a&gt;, so he'd cut in front of the person at the front of the line, and when they complained, he'd ignore them (this actually happened). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/22/kieslers.gif&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/09/22.html#l60a1aad9dbba17d33466766294610e29&quot;&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; in Rockaway probably in 1961 or so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was a legend. Still looms large in my mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I changed the way tabs work on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; home page.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are three tabs: Blog, Links and About.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click on a tab, you are redirected with a url of this form:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;http://scripting.com/?tab=&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; is the name of the tab you're going to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That way you always have a link to the tab in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the browser's Back button works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It used to do it all with JavaScript without redirecting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also no longer remembers what tab you had frontmost last time you visited the site. This was always annoying. Not a good heuristic. When I come to scripting.com 99 times out of 100 I want to see the blog.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/covid19/covid-counter.html&quot;&gt;This is great&lt;/a&gt;. Stanford University is setting up a network of Americans around the country to track their symptoms and exposure to people with CV. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/23.html#a154211&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; traveled through Seoul on her way home, she had to install a mobile app to keep a diary of her symptoms, if any. This is how they do containment, and it's great to see a similar system starting in the US, from a credible institution like Stanford. We're on the road now. Every American reader of this blog should sign up for daily reminders, and do it. If I could make it a requirement, I would. America being smart.</description>

			<description>I'm okay with people going to church as long as we can lock the doors after they're all inside. They should not be allowed to re-enter society after being so reckless with their own health. On FB they're saying they should stay inside for 14 days and those without symptoms be allowed to leave. I am reminded of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/05/never.png&quot;&gt;New Yorker cartoon&lt;/a&gt;. I think &quot;never&quot; is a better time to let them out.</description>

It is anonymous in aggregate so they can predict areas that will be most impacted based on how you are feeling. This data can help redirect medical resources and give public guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Think about it. Most of us, if exposed, may develop a mild case and stay home to recover. We may not be able to be tested because we are not sick enough. There aren't enough tests available either. That data point is considered &quot;under the radar&quot; and is not reported in the daily numbers we hear on the news.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But if we knew how people felt, self-reporting symptoms, we could get a jump on it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Given the 9-10 day delay between onset of symptoms and hospitalization, and the 20% hospitalization rate of patients, this type of survey tool can help fight the Coronavirus.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Please consider taking this survey to help end this pandemic quickly.

			<title>How CV got started in the US</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/04.html#a152322&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; a somewhat nuanced question, basically why does the virus travel in waves across the United States? Why is it not distributed uniformly across the country? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A retired bioresearcher sent via email a non-mathematical explanation that makes sense to me. Note he talks about places where Asians are in the US, it's a bit delicate, but since the virus originated in China, and I'm trying to understand why it's not everywhere, it is factually relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the story:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My degree is not in mathematics but after forty years in bioresearch I hope I know how to think logically. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People do move freely about the US, but it isnâ€™t random movement. There are also nuances in genetic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)&quot;&gt;endemic disease&lt;/a&gt;, age distribution demographics, health care infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Travelers congregate at airports, on cruise ships, and mingle at tourist destinations. There have been numerous maps published that show how spread of the virus aligns with popular travel routes and political alignments. Winter holiday travel turned out to be a particularly bad idea last year.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Our index case was already symptomatic when he left Wuhan and came home to Seattle in mid-January. New York didnâ€™t see their first case until March (via Iran). Both are coastal cities with seaports, major airports, universities, and diverse populations, but NYC is half the size of Seattle and has about nine times as many people. New Yorkers literally canâ€™t get away from each other.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Chinese Americans are not homogeneously distributed across the US, and they tend to live, work, and travel in aggregates. NYC and Seattle demographics show about the same proportions of Asians, but NYCâ€™s are jammed more tightly together and an airborne contagion would hit more people, more quickly there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;California's significant Asian population is clustered in Santa Clara County, by far the hardest hit by the virus. The state has been under shelter-in-place orders since mid-March. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia has a tiny Asian population and theyâ€™re all in one district. Philly also has a very large and well-equipped hospital in Center City; theyâ€™re prepared.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Drilling down into the data in my area, West Virginia was late to the party imo because the folks who choose to live there like their solitude in the woods, and they donâ€™t travel much. This held back the spread in the western parts of adjacent states (Maryland and Pennsylvania) where the first cases werenâ€™t seen intil mid-March. None of these areas have  significant Asian populations.The two Maryland counties with large Asian populations recorded their first cases a month earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The wave thing is - once the virus is in the door, one way or another itâ€™s gonna find you - itâ€™ll getcha getcha getcha - unless it canâ€™t, of course.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have additional info re this piece, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/162&quot;&gt;post here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I asked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1246347423045337089&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter this morning that apparently was not understood. Let's try again. When Gov Cuomo says that NY got hit first, I want to know why other American cities didn't get hit at roughly the same time. They say a virus moves in waves. First northern Italy gets it, then the south. NY has its hospitals overloaded, but not Philadelphia. The theory is, according to Cuomo, that the virus will peak in NY, and then peak in other places. Since people move freely around the US, why wouldn't it all happen at roughly the same time. I'd like you to remember, before answering, I have a math degree, and have spent decades working with logic and numbers in computer software. Saying that Dallas has cases, as has St Louis and Cleveland, while true, is not an answer to this puzzling question. Thanks in advance for considering this.</description>

			<title>The parent and child, in crisis</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're all depressed. I heard this explained well &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurenthehough/status/1246318803077804033&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; last night. Our brain tries to understand the predicament. Not the intellectual brain, the instinctive one. The subconscious. The child. The one that decides in an instant to fight or flight. The one that keeps your organs functioning, oversees the immune system's response to an invader. It's very powerful, but its vision is limited to the input coming in through your senses. It's not very well wired up to your conscious self, the intellect. Something is threatening you, it can detect that, but it doesn't understand what it is. So it makes you numb while it tries to figure it out. But it never can. So you feel depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all in this place. Yet somehow we manage to do things. To take care. Clean, feed, nurture ourselves. To find distractions. We create moments where we feel well. I've watched myself do this, and see myself doing something I learned in various workshops and classes I participated in, in my 30s and 40s. It involves another duality inside of all of us, the dependent child and the nurturing parent. I literally give voice to the parent. Let it speak, out loud, to the child.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm lying in bed at 10AM. I don't want to get up. The parent's voice says, Dave, it's time to get up. I don't want to, I don't want to. The parent holds my hand, and says don't worry, I've got this. I'll give you something good to eat, something delicious and filling. Then we'll play a game, and go for a walk, and the list goes on. Things my inner child likes. It doesn't matter so much that he likes these things, but that the patient, loving voice &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; he likes these things and will give them to him. Someone has taken charge, and the scared little boy feels loved, guarded, cherished. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why we like listening to Gov Cuomo, and can't stand listening to Trump. The former says I've got this. I'll get us through this. You can depend on me. The latter says I'm going to fuck things up even worse than they are. The former helps us get out of bed and face the world, the latter makes us want to pull the covers over our head and pretend we're in another place and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As adults, all of us have an inner parent we can call on, if we remember to do it. A leader like Cuomo helps us access our strength and determination, helps calm the fears of the child. We may not know the answers, but we will find them, together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="As adults, all of us have an inner parent we can call on, if we remember to do it. A leader like Cuomo helps us access our strength and determination, helps calm the fears of the child. We may not know the answers, but we will find them, together." created="Sat, 04 Apr 2020 15:53:10 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/04/04/154642.html?title=theParentAndChildInCrisis#a155310"/>

			<title>Narcos taught me something</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138189/narcos-mexico-review-netflix-season-two&quot;&gt;Narcos/Mexico&lt;/a&gt; just opened my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Season 1, Episode 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A young guy with a big idea gambles big and loses because his boss is an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's being taken off to be executed, but he's cool. He knows he's going to be killed. He took a risk and lost. He's ok with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Cops flag down the car, make everyone get out and they shoot everyone but the guy who was about to be killed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The cops were part of the big deal, and they liked the smart young dude so they killed his boss and made him the new boss.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Very nicely done, and even though I had seen it before, it totally held my interest. And I was glad to see it on April 4, 2020. If this is the end, why not go out with dignity and style?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought it was an interesting perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A bunch of things to write about today. Rolling up my sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the old days of blogging I had subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://val.demar.in/&quot;&gt;Paolo Valdemarin's blog&lt;/a&gt;. Then Paolo must've gotten busy, being an entrepreneur in Italy, and now a VC in London. Then once they had the lockdown in the UK, he started blogging again. My RSS aggregator, which had been checking his feed every fifteen minutes during his decade-long hiatus, sprung to life. The lights came on. Paolo is a much better writer than I remembered. His blog flows, his stories are human, his observations are easy to relate to. Silver linings everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnnaughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt;, though he never stopped writing. He's a columnist at the Guardian, also from the UK, a great thinker and observer. His blog is now published every morning (my timezone) &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/&quot;&gt;via Substack&lt;/a&gt;. I looked at using Substack before writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;my own software&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't like that I would have to manually transcribe my posts from my CMS to theirs to get them to publish it. It's 2020 for crying out loud. Support the standards. Or maybe they want their users locked in? I can't tell you how many times I've had to reimplement the entire functionality of a product to avoid having to manually transpose my writing or avoid lock-in. It's a VC way of thinking and not observant of the fundamental law of the web, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3&quot;&gt;people come back to places that send them away&lt;/a&gt;. Trust your users. If you have the best product, they'll continue to use it and sing your praises. If you don't, they'll bolt at the first opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Naughton also wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://privatekit.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Private Kit&lt;/a&gt;, though I can't find the reference now. It's a brilliant idea. An app for iOS or Android that tracks your whereabouts, but doesn't share the data with anyone but you. The info never leaves your phone without your permission. It offers new opportunities for resarchers studying among other things the migration of pandemic viruses through the population. This is the future, and a very nice way to spin it, MIT. Keep up the good work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
