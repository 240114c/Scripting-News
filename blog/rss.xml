			<description>The conclusion from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/10.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; political &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1193904968014729216&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; is this. Electing a Democratic president in a squeaker is not a win. It leaves the Republican Party alive with a huge electorate that the Democrats could not convert. It they can't do it now, then we'll never get out of gridlock. We're spinning down. We almost defaulted on the national debt. We're not renewing our physical or human infrastructure. Our treasury is easily looted by the rich. The Repubs will win the next election, and the cycle repeats. Squeaking out a win is not winning. The US will continue to decline, as will the planet's health, if we continue on the track we're on. We need a revolution, a fundamental reconfiguration of our political sysem so we can tackle the actual problems we have, not made-up ones. The kind of revolution the founders allowed for in the Constitution.</description>

			<description>An idea worth considering. Ask Knight to fund a project to catalog and publish all the political ads running on Facebook. This is the implementation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1192455974558294017&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; that Joe Trippi &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1193616884639379456&quot;&gt;liked&lt;/a&gt;. That means a lot, he's the only political hacker I know.</description>

			<description>So much great TV coming out in the weeks ahead. I might not get any work done. Right now I'm going through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt; a second time, slowly. It's worth doing, because now the things Elliot says to the audience make sense. After the big reveal on Mr Robot, he looks at the camera and asks &quot;Did you know?&quot; I laughed and said damn right I knew. It's interesting in a different way when you know what's real and what's not.</description>

			<description>It’s kind of scary how attached some people are getting to Their Candidate. Remember: 1. Most of them will lose. 2. Your favorite will probably lose. 3. We’re all going to support the Dem nominee, no matter how much they suck.</description>

			<title>A new two-party configuration</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TL;DR: There are a lot of winnable votes in the 40 percent who are likely to vote for Trump.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some elections reconfigure the balance between the two parties. Like Nixon, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy&quot;&gt;southern strategy&lt;/a&gt; flipped the south from Dem to Repub. He saw an opportunity, took it, it worked, was transformational, and that reconfiguration is still in place 50 years later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well never imho has the country needed to reconfigure the balance between the parties more than it does now. The Repubs are being driven to fascism. That's usually a fringe thing in the US, but now is on its way to becoming mainstream. That is if you believe Trump's &quot;base&quot; is fascist. I for one don't think they are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they hate liberal elites who think they know everything, but they think (in the flyover states) that they understand nothing about America. That's a complicated idea, and would take a lot of tweets to explain, but there's something real there. The America they grew up believing in, that many of us did, never was what they said it was, but it's still their core idea of America, and we've drifted very far from it. In their minds America is white, Christian, there's a mom and a dad and kids, and Thanksgiving, guns and self-sufficiency. This America doesn't have any problems. It kicks ass. It rules the world. And the white people dominate (a nice way of saying what it does to PoC's).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The basic grievance they have is this. Look at all the great things they're doing for &quot;others&quot; and I'm not getting any help at all. Take care of me first, and let the other guys pull themselves up like I did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They feel the way they feel. And you probably have a lot of hypocrisy and lies in your own view of the world, btw. I know the family I grew up in did. Some day I'll write a piece about all the lies they clung to. It'll be a long piece. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back to Trump's 40 percent. I'm not taling about all of them. Some for sure are real goose-stepping Jew-hating Nazis. But a lot of them just want to hear from a president &quot;I got your back,&quot; and then enumerate their fears, so they know you hear them. Even if their fears are off the wall. You can say you hear them without selling your soul, or selling out the former Democratic Party base. And that's how the center-left party can emerge. It'll be called the Democratic Party, but it'll have a lot of until-recently Republicans in it. Nothing wrong with that. The Republicans used to have liberals. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because the real important split in the US is between people who believe in the Constitution and those who don't. That's so basic. And now in 2019, it's peak season for converting rule-of-law Republicans to lifetime Democratic Party voters. And where the parents go, the kids are likely to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what's more important? A failed push for Medicare For All by President Warren or Sanders, or a new permanent political reality in the US that solves problems for 50 years led by President Bloomberg, Inslee or Klobuchar? I actually like Bloomberg because he mastered the sensibilities of business management, and has had three terms as NYC mayor to convert that sensibility to politics and governance. He's shovel ready, in other words. More than any of the others including Biden. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said at the beginning, this is a time when we could reconfigure the two-party system. There are a lot of winnable votes in the 40 percent who will vote for Trump if we nominate a Warren or Sanders. And if those votes plus minorities, city people and suburbanites could compromise, we could have a big enough majority to fix a lot of things. Things that most Trump voters want. Like to be sure of their health care. More jobs. Spending more money on domestic stuff as opposed to unwinnable forever wars. What they want, in a word, is security. These are all natural Democratic issues, and somehow via lies and Democratic lunacy the Repubs have been able to at least partially usurp them. That's because the Dems don't claim them. They get lost in the weeds talking about health benefits for non-citizens and taking away people's health insurance which for crying out loud is not even what the Dems are contemplating.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/11/08/777511592/read-testimony-of-fiona-hill-ex-white-house-russia-policy-official&quot;&gt;Fiona Hill's testimony&lt;/a&gt; last night, she's saying something similar about the political system in the US. We're smart, we know how to do big things. There are a lot of good people in the United States ready to kick ass. If you can just get the poltiical stuff under control, America will resume the greatness that it never lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Did a little prototyping for the &lt;i&gt;tweetsucker&lt;/i&gt; project I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/07.html#a144614&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the other day, and noted that the Twitter API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reneraab/node-twitter-api&quot;&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt; that I use is now marked as not maintained. It still works, but It seems this is something Twitter ought to maintain, or pay someone to maintain. Letting this fall out of sync with the actual API wouldn't be very good.</description>

			<description>I couldn't bring myself to watch the Knicks game last night with the Mavericks with their new star, and former Knick, Kristaps Porzingas, who for a few years was the embodiment of hope for the team. I was sure the Knicks would be blown away. What a surprise to wake up to find out &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/ntilikina-gem-in-win-over-porzingis-could-be-knicks-turning-point/&quot;&gt;the Knicks won&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;I don't think anyone was humiliated, but there's a sadness when you realize how great the team could be now if KP hadn't demanded a trade, had found a way to work with the Knicks.</description>

			<description>I didn’t realize people take the lack of a warning from Google or Firefox as an endorsement. If they do they’re going to be sorry because bad guys can get secure websites too. This is where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;push&lt;/a&gt; to https blows up. The next step, obviously, is to make websites register with Google, and have their changes approved the same way iPhone devs do. Quickly this will mean no criticism of China, and of course Google.</description>

			<description>This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/warren-jokes-at-lgbtq-town-hall/index.html&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; made a &quot;joke&quot; at the expense of people who believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Humor works, for presidents, only when it's self-deprecating. Otherwise you make a choice, you're the president of everyone, including people with unpopular beliefs, or remain a senator or college professor. Further she throws this at men, for some reason, as if men are the ones who think this about marriage, exclusively. Personally I don't care if you do or don't get married. I don't think the government should be involved. But same-sex marriage is a recent thing, and of course there are people who are uncomfortable with it. Probably MAGA sounds right to them. A president of everyone should re-assure them that they have the right to their belief, and can live their lives accordingly, but they can't control other people. Had Warren said that, that way (without the putdowns) I would have cheered.</description>

			<description>I was asked by an old friend what I think about lies in Facebook political ads. &quot;I think pragmatically that Zuck is caught between people who lie about the truth, that in most things there is no such thing as the truth, and all politicians lie, and we accept that, and only an asshole would try to impose rules on FB that they aren't willing to impose on themselves.&quot; I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1191370393745051650&quot;&gt;Twitter poll&lt;/a&gt; that was kind of an editorial.</description>

			<description>I have always despised this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/06/cartoonFullSize.png&quot;&gt;xkcd cartoon&lt;/a&gt;. I understand what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; says, I didn't need a cartoon to explain it. People send you this to remind you that your big mouth could cost you your job, and over time a lot more, as the social mob learned how to cancel people in bigger ways. Is that something to be proud of? That you're so intolerant of other views that your reaction is to punish people for expressing them. I remember when the social mob learned that an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich#Mozilla&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/a&gt; at a tech company had given money to a support a ballot measure that would deny same-sex couples the right to marry. He lost his job. I get it -- you had the right to do it. But that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/04/03/politicsNecessarilyCreatesDivisions.html&quot;&gt;doesn't&lt;/a&gt; make it right. I don't care one way or the other if you agree or disagree. But one of the great traditions of our country, that is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; part of the Constitution, is that we celebrate diversity. We listen, and give other ideas a chance to penetrate our view of the world. We have some flexibility. We could change our mind. As we grow older we strive to learn. So while it's not in the Constitution to listen and respect our differences, imho it is in our DNA.</description>

			<description>I have a bit of time to kill today, and I thought I'd try to get to the bottom of some weird behavior in the JS code for this blog. This item has an attached image that is revealed when you click the wedge next to the item. The second time you expand it, when it's revealed it happens very slowly, and it opens from the top and left, with a scrolling effect that I now find annoying. It doesn't do it the first time. I must have made it do this originally, but I don't remember how, and I can't seem to find the code. I'm going to keep looking. (Update: I was able to turn it off by setting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_slide.asp&quot;&gt;params&lt;/a&gt; to slideUp and slideDown to 0. Still not sure why it was doing it for this data type, and not for others.) &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I think Sherrod Brown or Amy Klobuchar would be good Democratic candidates for president. I listened to today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/podcasts/the-daily/whos-ahead-2020.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the chances of the Demo candidates based on polling the NYT just did. It's not a good picture. They say Biden would win, but the Repubs haven't run a campaign on him yet. They're going to let the Dems tear him to shreds first, which they will. People think this is about policy, it's not. &lt;i&gt;People want to feel like winners. &lt;/i&gt;I wouldn't feel like a winner, of any kind, if my president was Warren, Sanders or Biden. Ugh. Anyway if a Democrat is elected what they'll do will depend totally on the makeup of Congress. The more Repubs are left the more compromise, unless of course Trump is re-elected, then you can forget about who's in Congress, it won't matter. Our Congress will be no more consequential than Russia's. I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/poll-trump-beats-democrats-swing-state-biden-warren-sanders.html&quot;&gt;Chait&lt;/a&gt; that the Dems have been living in a fantasy world. None of the leading candidates will beat Trump, none of them.</description>

			<title>Why impeach asap</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So much discussion in the news about impeachment, and they never talk about the #1 reason to impeach, asap. So here's a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's running the presidency as if he was a monarch. Ignoring the Constitution. And the longer he gets away with it the worse it gets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They should make a song about this. How the president is not a king. We could change the words to the Star Spangled Banner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>As the 2016 election approached, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; published a series of graphs showing over time the likelihood of Clinton or Trump winning. All through October, as Clinton gained confidence, the two branches of the graph diverged, until &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comey#/media/File:Comey_Letter.jpg&quot;&gt;FBI Director Comey's letter&lt;/a&gt; to Congress. I watched it live and my heart sank. Here we go again. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Hillary%27s+Emails+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt;. That evening, Clinton gave a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?417629-2/hillary-clinton-calls-release-information-email-investigation&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;. Eleven days before the election. Voting is already underway. We understood the damage. And you can see it clearly in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/04/fiveThirtyEightGraph.png&quot;&gt;the graph&lt;/a&gt; on this day in 2016. Yes, Clinton was still twice as likely to win as Trump. But the graph was going the wrong way. And we know how it turned out. So remember, the story that the NY Times invented, promoted with love by the FBI and the rest of journalism, was probably a bigger cause of America's defeat than Cambridge Analyitica and Facebook. But of course the NYT controls the conversation, and is unaccountable, so the blame is focused elsewhere.</description>

That evening, Clinton gave a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?417629-2/hillary-clinton-calls-release-information-email-investigation&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;. Eleven days before the election. Voting is already underway. We understood the damage. And you can see it clearly in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/04/fiveThirtyEightGraph.png&quot;&gt;the graph&lt;/a&gt; on this day in 2016. Yes, Clinton was still twice as likely to win as Trump. But the graph was going the wrong way. And we know how it turned out. So remember, the story that the NY Times invented, promoted with love by the FBI and the rest of journalism, was probably a bigger cause of America's defeat than Cambridge Analyitica and Facebook. But of course the NYT controls the conversation, and is unaccountable, so the blame is focused elsewhere." created="Mon, 04 Nov 2019 14:17:52 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/12/20/butHerEmails.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/11/04.html#a141752"/>

			<description>We need a C-SPAN for the web. Not archive.org (which is great). A place where you can put things on the record, so when something notable happens you can be sure this will be the last place to disappear, or to be put behind a paywall.</description>

			<description>I try to ask questions political journalism would ask if it were tech-aware. And the other way around. There's an intersection that is mostly missing. The enemy has been investing there. And enemy is the right word.</description>

			<description>It was obvious that the Warriors were going to crumble if not this year next year. Dynasties in the NBA are pretty complete unlike other sports, and the teams on top get bored. Winning it all meant something the first time, maybe a bit the second but after that it gets tired. We saw it happen first with the Miami Heat.</description>

			<title>JsonFeed after two years</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of years later, I've yet to see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsonfeed.org/&quot;&gt;JsonFeed&lt;/a&gt; in the wild. And if such a thing existed, I suspect there would also be an RSS 2.0 version of the same content. In the group where developers discuss it, which I follow, most or all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues&quot;&gt;feature requests&lt;/a&gt; are things that have already been done in RSS or Atom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was, provably, no reason to do this. At this point, is there a language or environment that doesn't have an open source library for reading feeds? It's just one call in my JavaScript code to take a bit of text that's supposed to be a feed and get back a JavaScript structure with the contents. Couldn't be simpler. Yet I don't think many of those libraries include support for this two-year-old format. So you have to do more work to read it. One of the goals of the new format was that it would be less work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And on the writing side, maybe writing JSON is a little easier than writing XML, but again, if 20 years after the advent of RSS, you don't have a toolkit in your environment to write feeds, you should probably do it yourself and share it with other devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally if you were going to invent a new format why not just JSONify an existing feed structure. I did that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/10/rssInJsonForReal.html&quot;&gt;for RSS&lt;/a&gt; in a few minutes. My blog is still &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;available in JSON&lt;/a&gt; as well as XML. No need for debates or feature requests. It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rssjs.org/&quot;&gt;RSS but in JSON&lt;/a&gt;. It Just Works&amp;trade;. Not that anyone uses it, for the reasons mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've known both &lt;a href=&quot;https://manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/&quot;&gt;Brent&lt;/a&gt;, the authors of the format, for many years. Nice people. But this was a mistake. Atom, also, was a mistake. All the energy should have been focused on a standard that would be supported everywhere, &lt;i&gt;as easily as possible. &lt;/i&gt;I did it myself. I had designed a format when RSS came along, from Netscape, and I dropped it in favor of RSS, because one way to do something is better than two no matter how much better the second way is. A hard-won lesson from many times around the loop. Hopefully this is something will not be repeated for RSS at least, in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>To Woodstock readers, a couple of ideas. 1. Eventually imho it would be cool if someone did what I'm doing but focused on the town and county. 2. I'm thinking of hosting a meetup, perhaps in my living room, where we do this face to face. I talk for a few minutes on topics either from the blog (most likely) or other subjects. I have done this before, in California and Boston, it can be really interesting. Kind of a like a book club for something that's ongoing, not finished. Or a book tour that lasts months. Just a couple of ideas, seeds planted for the future. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🌲&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A blogging meta-note. I use my blog-writing as a break from development work. Ideas occur to me while doing other stuff. I use the blog as a notebook to record them. I also use Twitter as a first draft. As I've said before the 280-char limit made Twitter a lot more useful. I have a graphic editing environment for blogging that only runs on a Mac. When an idea occurs to me when I'm away from work, I can use a phone or tablet to record it on Twitter. It's there when I'm back at my Mac. It's a pretty decent editorial system. I sent a DM yesterday to Jack Dorsey asking to work on the integration of Twitter with desktop writing tools (my own in particular of course). I think it's so close toa breakthrough. I can feel it. I've been right about this before, btw. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Changes in our world are happening so fast. I wish more news orgs took this as an opportunity to teach and reinforce American rules of self-governance. (British too, btw.) They matter now. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+jury+duty&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;jury duty&lt;/a&gt;. You'd be amazed at what random Americans can do. We are capable of understanding a lot, with nuance. Look at the rules of any sport, baseball, football, etc. Very complicated. Yet huge numbers of people understand them. And we have a baseline of truth in sports talk. People don't make up averages or rules, yet there's lots of room for subjective opinion. In some countries sports talk does turn violent, but not in the US. Wouldn't be a bad model for a new news org to adopt, up front. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;⌚&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I get it. I tried watching the Nets v Rockets last night. Preferred the Knicks v Celtics. The Knicks are more interesting this year. A mix of young and old. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Barrett&quot;&gt;sensational rookie&lt;/a&gt;. The boring part of the NBA are the corporate players like Kyrie and KD. Mercenaries. Oh we'll occupy the Nets so we can take cheap shots at the Knicks. Wow. Brilliant. No one cares about the Nets. They get their paycheck and they'll move on to humiliate another team next year, until fans get tired of it. Thing is most of the fans already are. Ask Toronto. You know the players must think we don't know it's about teams. We really don't care about them so much. Make good teams and we'll be happy. That's why we like the Celtics, the Bucks, Philly, and guess what the Knicks look okay this year. Someone put some care into creating this team. I think that's what the Knicks have been missing. Someone who cares about them. But the Knicks would've said yes to Kyrie, I'm glad they didn't get the chance.</description>
