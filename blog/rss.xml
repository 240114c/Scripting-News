			<description>I had to see a specialist doctor today. At 63 my doctors are all younger than me. This one was so bright, careful in explaining and listening, enthusiastic about good health, an evangelist. Just 31 years old. Made me feel so optimistic about the future.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052224515932073990&quot;&gt;weird idea&lt;/a&gt; I proposed to one of my favorite political analysts. Why can't journalism raise issues? They don't have to let politicians drive this. Don't the voters have issues that need airing? What about the people who wrote the Constitution who expected Congress to act as a check on the Executive branch? Why do we have to sit on the sidelines and accept the crap they hand us. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052317163778990081&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; is doing it. Jeez. You'd think they wrote off the intellect and seriousness of the electorate. Time to change the way we do things. Journalism could be where the change starts. Of course they would have to listen, for a new idea to penetrate. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I want a new kind of news where there are no professionals. Only user-generated ideas. No blame discussed. No live debates. Only ideas for how to solve the obvious problems, and then we write the Occam’s version of the story.</description>

			<title>My agenda for the midterms</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I scattered $25 contributions all around &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/senate2018/&quot;&gt;the country&lt;/a&gt; for Senate races, so of course now I'm getting calls and spam from Dems wanting more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they're willing to call me, with a real human being (it seems) why not send an email written by a human being, asking if I have anything I want to contribute that might not be money?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Someday political parties will do more than advertise, they will gather the best ideas from the people and implement them. A different kind of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Right now I'd tell the Dems to talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/16/oversight.png&quot;&gt;oversight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Restoring power to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that means voting out the Repubs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to hear some promises from Dems that they plan to provide the missing oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why didn’t Elizabeth Warren hold on to the results of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/181015/p5#a181015p5&quot;&gt;her study&lt;/a&gt; until Trump raised the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/07/05/trump_offers_1_million_for_pocahontas_elizabeth_warren_to_take_dna_test.html&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; again? Raising it herself just before the midterms seems like the most disadvantageous timing. Imagine if Trump re-stated his offer of $1 million, then she could release the study. Bonk.

			<description>On Facebook, King Kaufman asks if the bike rider in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/15/bikeInRightLane.png&quot;&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; is doing the right thing. I responded:  What the bike rider doing is correct. The only alternative would be to go in the left lane, and another driver is going to be pissed about that (he has to wait for the bike to get going and over to the right before he gets up to speed).</description>

			<description>This is the most puzzling and curiosity-provoking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/opinion/stephen-elliott-moira-donegan-media-men.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; I've read about #metoo. The men, who said they were innocent, were critical of another man who also claims innocence, for coming forward. &quot;The collective sense is that Mr. Elliott should do what they’re doing: 'taking one for the team,' as one of them put it.&quot; Elliot said “Multiple people asked me at first if I was O.K. just taking a bullet for the movement.

			<description>I've known Don Park for a long time. Goes back to when I lived in the middle of the golf course at the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sharon+Park+Dr,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.4248451,-122.2205468,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa4e515ff326d:0xc832d9097802f942!8m2!3d37.4244532!4d-122.2083052&quot;&gt;Sharon Park Drive&lt;/a&gt; in Menlo Park. Don did the INIT for &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/TNM_Userland_IAC_Toolkit_for_programmers_1991_20170830_0072/page/n0&quot;&gt;UserLand IAC Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=UserLand+IAC+Toolkit&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;was&lt;/a&gt; the precursor for the Apple Event Manager and ultimately XML-RPC and SOAP. Don is thinking about blogs these days, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/donpark/status/1051533792324636673&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; something &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/donpark/status/1051544612911738880&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday about blogrolls. He says wtf happened. There is no good discovery mechanism for blogs. I agree. Don had some immediate ideas, so I offered to start a thread on it, so maybe we could come up with some experiments we could do to see if maybe we couldn't bootstrap something now. That's what the previous post, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/15.html#a141922&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt; is about.</description>

He says wtf happened. There is no good discovery mechanism for blogs. I agree. Don had some immediate ideas, so I offered to start a thread on it, so maybe we could come up with some experiments we could do to see if maybe we couldn't bootstrap something now.

			<title>Another tweet that's a blog post</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/13/tweetAsBlogPost.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1051109183389601792&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Here's the text, so search engines can find it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I used to speak freely on my blog in the early days, that was the thrill of it, and I still do speak more freely there, but it feels like very few people read what I write there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But I'm scared to speak freely here (on Twitter). Not because of bots-as-trolls, rather not wanting to be attacked by &quot;the left.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I find this interesting, because I vote totally lefty these days. I give to Democratic candidates. I promote them to the best of my ability.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But even so, my ideas would evoke a mob reaction from my allies. They have in the past,. It's a big punishment for speaking your mind. So I hold back.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We've invented something that looks like speech, but it's more of a way for mobs to organize. And the term mob, which I hate that the Repubs are using, so effectively, actually is the right word.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if there isn't some way to get through to our allies witout evoking their rage, that sometimes, maybe all the time, the rage works against our cause. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It would be better to hear what people think, rather than shouting them down and intimidating them into silence. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remember even if you can't hear them, they can still vote. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you asked my father what Dave's favorite music is, he would have told you what his favorite music is, and (importantly) he'd think he's answering the question. If you ask someone why Dave works so hard, he'll tell you what he aspires to. He might say Dave does it to get rich. That wouldn't tell you anything about Dave, but it likely tells you something about him. This is important to understanding disputes, and is why listening is so important. For example, the US thought North Vietnam was fighting because they were part of a global communist alliance to defeat the west. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory&quot;&gt;Domino Theory&lt;/a&gt;. Because we were at war against that. The Vietnamese were actually fighting a war of independence, and were puzzled why the US, a former colony that fought for its independence, was fighting them. Moral of the story: Unless you ask, you probably don't know why someone is doing what they do.</description>

			<title>Conferences and unconferences</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't like conferences that are all about the speakers, esp if I don't know who they are. When you put people on stage speaking, they have had so much time to prepare, they have slides for everything they thought of while they were preparing, and sometimes that was months. So it takes forever for them to get to the point. Or they don't do much prep, and they just play back the pitch they made to VCs or play the deck they used on their press tour.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or they're blowhard CEOs, so full of themselves they hardly know anyone else is there. I once heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison&quot;&gt;Larry Ellison&lt;/a&gt; speak at a tech industry conference where he thought he was talking to an Oracle User Group! At least we got to hear what he says to them (it was mostly press, financial types and his competitors). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across a different format in the 00s that we called an &lt;i&gt;unconference,&lt;/i&gt; a name that has since been usurped by a different format. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;our format&lt;/a&gt;, it's a discussion group with a leader at the front who interviews the room. It has to be someone who knows who's there, and has an idea for a story, and has a hardass attitude about people droning, repeating, and self-serving. With someone who knows what they're doing, it's something to behold. Everyone is on their toes, involved. And you can be called on, so you can't afford to lose track of what's going on in the room. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find professors and reporters make good moderators. The more opinionated they are the better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/newsgeist?lang=en&quot;&gt;Newsgeist&lt;/a&gt; conference I went to a couple of years ago actually carries on that tradition, in some of the sessions. I wonder why? Maybe it's because &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; is involved, and he was a big fan of the format back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What made me think of this is I've been getting email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://poptech.org/&quot;&gt;Poptech&lt;/a&gt;, a conference in Maine in early November. It's totally about the speakers. Kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences&quot;&gt;TED&lt;/a&gt;ish (though it's not a copy, it's a contemorary). I didn't know any of the speakers. I'm pretty sure I don't know any of the attendees. Why spend $2000 for that? Not that I didn't consider it, I did. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Any time someone is inviting me to be enraged online, I'm suspicious that I'm being manipulated. My standard practice is to unfollow the person who sent them to me. They may mean well, but they're being used. I don't need your rage, I have plenty of my own. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Interesting Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1049960588896595973&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with Davis Shaver re what's going on in the WordPress community. I don't have time to write about it now, but it sounds like what I experienced in the Frontier community leading up to my leaving in 2002. I will say this, that you can't forget that it's software you'd developing, and not the community. That's where the focus has to be. Otherwise you explode. No one person can be the focal point of a development community, and if it's a blogging community it's 100000 times worse! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>There’s this great line at the end of an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order&quot;&gt;Law &amp; Order&lt;/a&gt;. Jack McCoy says the person who was convicted got a tough sentence. The DA, an old man, says when he gets out he’ll be 35. “I’d take it,” he said.

			<description>I found a perfect use-case for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp&quot;&gt;CSS variables&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; hard-codes the size of &amp;lt;h4&gt; elements at 17.5 pixels. In the editor I'm developing, the default size is 18px. I find it's the most readable size for editing. Anyway, when you put a small head in the text using &amp;lt;h4&gt; the text is actually &lt;i&gt;smaller&lt;/i&gt; than the surrounding text. Not good. Enter CSS variables. Declare --normal-font-size as 18px, override Bootstrap's idea of the size of &amp;lt;h4&gt;, and use the same variable in defining the size of all the other text. That way the relationship is clear in the code, and if we ever want to change the size of normal text, it's easy to do. This is progress. Code just got more maintainable. 👍</description>

			<description>I made a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/senate2018/&quot;&gt;Democratic candidates&lt;/a&gt; for Senate in 2018 so I could donate to all. There are 34 total candidates. The normal 33 plus the special election for Al Franken's seat in Minnesota.  So if you wanted to give $25 to each, it would cost $850.</description>

			<title>Being picky is for losers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I find people who are willing to trade off moral superiority against losing the election, still, given all that's happening, the most depressing thing about American politics. No one cares about your &quot;point&quot; -- we're trying to get back on course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of an analogy. Suppose you're taking a car trip and your navigator decides to take you over a bridge that's washed out because it's shorter than the detour that isn't washed out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to give up one thing to get the thing you really need.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Manchin voted for Kavanaugh. His opponent will for sure vote with McConnell on everything. Manchin would not have been the deciding vote if it came down to that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a real joy in giving up on perfection. Now you can get something done.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>#metoo as a political issue</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A longtime friend was taken down by #metoo. Lost everything. The screed against him, posted on Medium, when edited down to real, not imagined, accusations was that when he was drunk he felt the breasts of a woman who was also drunk, in public, at a party at a tech conference.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He admitted it, and apologized, even though because he is an alchoholic, he had no memory of it. I thought the accusation should have been made without a lot of the imagined offenses, very clearly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't one of the famous targets of #metoo, he was just quietly deleted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No, I don't think it was fair, but that isn't the point of my story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted a note of love and support for my friend on Facebook, and almost immediately the threats of accusations against me came both publicly and privately. Nothing that amounted to anything, but it made it clear I'd better shut up, or else I'll be joining my friend in oblivion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was terribly sick in 2002, he was one of three friends who stood by me. He came to visit regularly while I was recuperating. He always listens when I have something to say. He's a good friend. He also can be a total jerk. I've seen that too. He got drunk on a lot of bullshit, not just alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since then the #metoo parade has passed him by. I'm sure very few people remember what happened to him. But he can't get back on his feet. He's in AA now. He's become a house husband, taking care of the kids while his wife works. I'm sure some people take pleasure in this, feel it's only fair that a man's life be destroyed this way, because so much terrible stuff has happened to women.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally I get to the point of the story..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you're right, in some moral way, maybe men do deserve this. But while my friend's life has been destroyed, he can still vote. His friends can vote. I won't vote Republican because of this, but I would like the Democrats to start worrying about this too, not seeing it as so one-sided, that all women are right and fair, always, and would never accuse a man of doing something he didn't actually do. Or wouldn't embellish it to make it more dramatic. Or use an accusation to get even for some other perceived offense. Or maybe for no reason at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Women are people, as humanly flawed as men. Give them a way to hurt other people, and they will use it. The idea that a woman would never make an accusation unless they knew it was true is incorrect. So we need to do better than simply &quot;believe the woman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, there was abuse in my family when I was growing up. So I know how it ruins lives. I've written about it on my blog. There's a lot more I could write if I had the courage to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Because there is unfairness in the #metoo movement, because it silences a legitimate point of view, it gives the Republicans something to campaign on that resonates. We have a problem. Much more than Kavanaugh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

He got drunk on a lot of bullshit, not just alcohol." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:04:35 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150435"/>

He's become a house husband, taking care of the kids while his wife works. I'm sure some people take pleasure in this, feel it's only fair that a man's life be destroyed this way, because so much terrible stuff has happened to women." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:04:50 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150450"/>

				<source:outline text="Maybe you're right, in some moral way, maybe men do deserve this. But while my friend's life has been destroyed, he can still vote. His friends can vote. I won't vote Republican because of this, but I would like the Democrats to start worrying about this too, not seeing it as so one-sided, that all women are right and fair, always, and would never accuse a man of doing something he didn't actually do. Or wouldn't embellish it to make it more dramatic. Or use an accusation to get even for some other perceived offense.

He said: &quot;As we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around.&quot; What is he talking about? Bush v Gore? The 9-11 attacks? The war in Iraq?

			<description>After Kavanaugh’s opening statement that should have been it, but the Dems didn’t think on their feet. They had their plan, why not let the FBI investigate. But they now had something much stronger. Kavanaugh had disqualified himself. The press missed this too. But it's weird the Dems missed this. How many of them are former prosecutors? At least Blumenthal, Harris and Klobuchar are. I can't believe they didn't notice his testimony had crossed a line. They should have questioned him on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/02/kavanaughExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;every word&lt;/a&gt; in that three paragraph flameout. On TV while everyone was watching, and all the Repubs could offer was the prosecutor from Arizona.</description>

			<description>There's conventional wisdom in the tech world that only standards made between big companies matter. In my experience, without exception, it's the exact opposite. Only the ones that grew &quot;in the wild&quot; (from the BigCo perspective) work as standards, as opposed to PR hype.</description>

			<description>In the early days of #metoo there wasn't much point in trying to say that there were men who were respectful of women. Men who see women as people, just like they are, and believe in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule&quot;&gt;Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt;, and apply it. There was an angry hashtag for this, #notallmen, which translated as #wedontwanttohearit. Even so, I believe that most women get that men are people, just like they are. We know that there are all kinds of people of all genders, with issues that were created through their families or genes or other factors. There are differences in bodies and strength, but I have wanted to say that our bodies are the same size online. It was therefore refreshing to see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/10/4/17933530/sexual-assault-me-too&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, that started as a Twitter thread, written by a woman, who says what imho needed to be said.</description>
