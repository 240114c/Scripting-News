			<description>I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/06/155950.html&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; 25 years ago today. I write every day and publish it myself. Today I've done the same. And hopefully encouraged more people to speak for themselves.</description>

			<description>Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/testing/timesincescriptingstarted/&quot;&gt;countdown page&lt;/a&gt; where we keep track of how long it has been since &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; was started. If you keep this page open you can say you were here at the moment it had been running for 25 years! If you think it's just a number (and there's good reason to believe that) you can continue with your life. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üçé&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer Show&lt;/a&gt; this morning the question came up of why Trump released the &quot;transcript&quot; of his talk with the Ukranian president. I have a theory about that which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1181212175513346049&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; to the show. It goes like this. Trump approved of its release without reading the transcript, or listening to his advisors. They wanted it released because it prevents Trump from throwing them under the bus. It's the new reality of a president who has the attention span of a gnat. Sometimes that works against him more than it works against us.</description>

			<description>Theory why Repubs don't stand up to Trump. After the 2016 election, the Russian &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Measures_(film)&quot;&gt;active measures&lt;/a&gt; campaign turned to building &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat&quot;&gt;kompromat&lt;/a&gt; on every Republican member of Congress. It didn't take long to get each one of them in a position where they had to listen to Russia and Trump. This is one of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Occam%27s+News&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt; things. Like black holes in space, you can't see them, but you can infer their presence by the way bodies behave around them</description>

			<title>Dear Jack, installment 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; subscribes to the email version of this blog, so I've started writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/30/132753.html&quot;&gt;directly to him&lt;/a&gt; in an open format. I'd do the same for the CEOs of any other tech firm whose products I use. Free consulting. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I find myself hooking into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PitchingNinja/status/1181268716056657925&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter more and more. Like this ridiculous annoying exasperating &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1181249348824379393&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with a Bush-era Republican, shilling for Trump while trying to sound reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More and more, news orgs are posting short bits of video to Twitter. It's growing, and that's imho good.  Further, Twitter has a good API and it's relatively stable and liberal. I've thought for a long time that their API is their big advantage. As a developer I'd like to see them do more with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a new kind of TV news looking for the right user interface. I don't think Moments is the answer. I think Checkbox News is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/checkboxNews.html&quot;&gt;Checkbox News&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/07/checkboxNewsFullSize.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did this around the time Boris Yeltsin died and the Virginia Tech massacre. I want to watch the news while I work, or tweet while I watch the news, basically &lt;i&gt;news isn't the only thing I'm doing. &lt;/i&gt;I want a bit of control over what flows through the video window. I got it, Yeltsin died. All the reports are starting to sound the same, so I uncheck it. No more news of Yeltsin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As media has progressed, we've learned that sometimes it's best to turn things on, and in other contexts that's too much work, I want others to do it for me, and then I need the ability to turn things off. TV news is most definitely in the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the flow that Twitter already has, if trusted news sources (a super important concept that should also be developed, not by Twitter) would add keywords to their video uploads, we could have Checkbox News running pretty quickly, maybe as early as next year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Introducing myself to Woodstock</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I just posted this to the private Woodstockers Say Anything group on Facebook. I've been living here since March, but mostly have been posting pictures and questions about what's going on here. This is the first time I've talked about what I do. I thought this was a good day to do it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't really introduced myself to the Woodstock group, today is a good day to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a software developer and one of the very first bloggers, starting back in 1994, on October 7.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;25 years ago today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These days I'm writing at my house in Woodstock.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am lucky that the work I do can be done anywhere there's a net connection. So I've moved around quite a bit in the last 25 years. I started writing on the web in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_California&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. In 2003 I moved to Cambridge, MA, then tried Seattle and the beach in northeast Florida (I had family there). I spent a few years in Berkeley, and then when my father died in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/03/fathersDay.html&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, I moved back to NYC (where I was born and raised) to be near my rapidly shrinking family. When my mom passed away in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/11/152545.html&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, I started looking for the next place, and this is where I landed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always felt that my software development was an artistic endeavor. My materials are unusual, they're almost all virtual. But I've built quite a castle out of all that imagination. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next software product I ship will come from Woodstock. And I'm celebrating 25 years of blogging right here in the woods, with the sound of rain and the smell of nature all around me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of my mottos of blogging is this --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still diggin! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: My blog is at http://scripting.com/.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

When my mom passed away in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/11/152545.html&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, I started looking for the next place, and this is where I landed." created="Mon, 07 Oct 2019 16:14:44 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/161106.html#a161444"/>

That would be the end of Trump. You can report on polls. You can report on FBI investigations of him. Or his trial with Trump U. Or that HRC calls for him not to get security briefings, all that's fair. But you can't report any Trump-generated news. If it came from him, it's trolling. If it's news about him that he didn't control, it's fair game.&quot; That's why the whistleblowers, witnesses and congressional committees are helping us win the battle with Trump. For the first time in a long time, Trump has lost control. We're in new territory.</description>

It says that HRC had a 75% chance of winning. The black line at the right is Election Day. Most people didn't understand enough about probability to understand what that meant, so presumably weren't motivated to vote. This is a lesson you don't hear reported on much in the press. The election wasn't decided by anti-abortion gun-rights advocates. It was decided by the people who didn't vote.</description>

			<title>How I program</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this in a 2014 email to one of my former programming partners, Jake Savin, about how I develop today. I use the same tools five years later. It was a good design. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I program in the OPML Editor. I have a suite that makes it one button to deploy all the changed objects in my outline to public spaces on S3, ready to run. It's amazingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have debugging on the client but not the server. But I am radical about pushing functionality to the edge, and using the server just to make up for deficiencies in other APIs that prevent them from being called from the client. So it hasn't been that much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This environment is so primitive compared to Frontier, but everyone can use it, so that's why I work here. People think I've been incredibly productive, the truth is I've done all this stuff before, so it goes quickly the third or fourth time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why are we impeaching the president, big picture. Our system has gone off the rails, we've got a monarch in the White House. This impeachment is the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution&quot;&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and has the same goal as the first, to depose a king.

No Internet access, no food. The constitutional president governs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Guest_House&quot;&gt;Blair House&lt;/a&gt;. Trump comes out or dies there. Either way, eventually the White House is torn down, as a symbol of the imperial presidency. From now on the president &lt;i&gt;strictly&lt;/i&gt; follows the Constitution, no more undeclared wars, Congress appropriates the money. Impeachment hearings start immediately after the Inauguration, and at the first sign of the breach of the Constitution, the president is impeached and removed. It's not going to be a glamorous job in the future. We're getting rid of our second king, and we must make sure no usurper like Trump can turn the office of President into an authoritarian pulpit. Burning the White House to the ground serves as a symbol of that transition.</description>

			<description>Trump isn‚Äôt playing multidimensional chess, and neither is Putin. His goal was to reduce the US to chaos. Our elections are now meaningless. Mass killings by people with automatic weapons. No sense of normalcy. The news people are focused on impeachment, but since just after the 2016 election have buried the big story. The US has been defeated. We're occupied. We live in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_France&quot;&gt;Vichy&lt;/a&gt; America. The president is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17576956/transcript-putin-trump-russia-helsinki-press-conference&quot;&gt;Russian asset&lt;/a&gt;. It's all out in the open, but until the whistleblower, no one, not Mueller, not the Repubs in Congress, not the Dems in Congress, nor the Dems running for president, have had the guts to say the truth out loud. We all hope someone else will take the risk. We have to fight to get out of this. It's going to be bloody. But the longer we wait the worse it'll be.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1179810620952207362&quot;&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt;, presidential candidate, wants Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's Twitter account. My two cents. This is what‚Äôs wrong with today‚Äôs net, that it‚Äôs up to one unelected unaccountable tech exec to decide if the elected president has a voice. Twitter has too much power. They endow people they like with millions of followers, and delete accounts for friends. No one has to listen to Trump. I‚Äôve had him blocked for years.</description>

			<description>The reporting on Ukraine misses an important point. Not only was Trump putting the squeeze on Ukraine to become part of his mob, he was also selling them out.

			<description>WIth &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/07.html&quot;&gt;Big 25&lt;/a&gt; coming up, it's great to hear from people who were reading in the early years. For example, David Boroditsky checked in yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/boroditsky/status/1179081346943078400&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. He sent a link to an email he sent me, which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/stories/DavidBoroditsky.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; to the blog, in Oct 1996, two years after the start. He talks about the non-web features of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I forget that Frontier and the blog were two sides of the same coin in the early days. All the early blogging and RSS software ran in Frontier.</description>

			<description>Because Barr is in such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/2019/10/01/the-dangerous-position-of-william-barr/&quot;&gt;precarious position&lt;/a&gt;, and he's smart, he must have factored in the risk before going out on the limb. He's betting that he and Trump et al will be able to toss the Constitution in a trash can, and govern any way they want, without oversight and inconvenient co-equal branches of government. We're at much at risk as he is.</description>

			<description>Trump is breaking the Constitution. Openly, and it'll never be repaired if he isn't cancelled. We should have fought this &quot;civil war&quot; a long time ago, but all the time we delay the chances of our form of govt surviving goes down.</description>

The original idea, 25 years ago, was letting go of product ideas that I wouldn't be able to commercialize.

			<description>In the almost-25 years of blogging on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, I did take a few weeks off here and there. In the 90s, mostly to take week-long massage classes, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Hot_Springs&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; where there was no internet access, which was  common back then, believe it or not.</description>

			<description>My two cents on changing Facebook to keep its power manageable. 1. Its social graph should be a public resource. Spin it out. The APIs should be open like the web APIs are. 2. Facebook should peer with the open web, so it isn't a silo.</description>

			<description>Why is it that the future-of-news conversation is exclusive to people who have a vested interest in the way things are. If we've learned anything about the future -- of everything -- is that it's disruptive to the way things are.</description>
