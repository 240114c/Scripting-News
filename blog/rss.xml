			<description>Another thing most people don't get. Developing platforms even before you roll them out, takes a lot of time. People think about platforms as if you could imagine a movie like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)&quot;&gt;Titanic&lt;/a&gt; one day, and have it in the theaters in a month or two. Platforms take time.</description>

			<description>On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/podcasts/the-daily/covington-nathan-phillips.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; Daily podcast they went through the confusion about the kids who appeared to be harassing the Native American veteran singing at the Lincoln Memorial. The lesson we keep learning is that you can't always tell what happened considering only one or two points of view. This is the mistake journalism keeps making, assuming there's a Democrat and Republican view and nothing else. They miss a lot of other points of view that matter, such as the view of their readers/viewers. We're not in DC, and we're not running for president, and we're not going to win or lose, but we still need info. Isn't that why you all do the news?? In the Wilbur Ross story they omitted important information. They wanted to make Ross look bad, but actually he was making a good point. Maybe run a piece for the furloughed employees listing their options, which I'm learning (through my tweet below, not through the news) are developing. A smaller point, but also important, sometimes people we don't like say things that are true and important.</description>

			<description>Okay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/01/24/wilbur-ross-federal-workers-should-take-out-loans-during-the-shutdown.html&quot;&gt;Wilbur Ross&lt;/a&gt; is an ass, I get that. But none of the articles I've read, and there are lots of them, debunk his claim that banks would happily loan workers against their &quot;federally guaranteed&quot; missing paychecks. Is this true or false? Has anyone asked a bank?</description>

			<title>Idea: A paywall you can buy out</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hate paywalls. I pay to get through two of them, the NY Times and the Washington Post. If I were going to pay for others, I would certainly add New York Magazine, primarily for one columnist, Jonathan Chait, who writes a large number of (imho) must-read columns. Like the one he wrote today about the Republican way of hostage-taking, and how you just can't give into it. I remember very well how, during the Obama Administration, Mitch McConnell threatened to crash the economy if they didn't get unilateral concessions. Obama caved once, but the second time they tried it, he learned -- and gave absolutely no ground. That stopped the hostage-taking. But now they're at it again.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would like everyone to read that column but it's behind a paywall, so I'm reluctant to push the link. But this made me think of a slight variation on the paywall idea. How about this -- I read the Chait piece, and I think it's so important that I want everyone to read it. So I pledge $5 toward a specified buyout price, say $10K. It would be clearly stated, and you'd see how much further they have to go. If they never reach buyout, you pay nothing. But if it does, they take your money and the paywall comes down, for this article. Everyone can read it for free. Next time he writes a column, it gets a new countdown and perhaps a new price. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you get the benefit of a paywall, which most readers probably hate, and a way to make it come down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Her company is suffocating the open web, so itâ€™s really not her question to ask. Imho, ultimately we'll think of the big tech companies the way we think of any powerful dominant industry. Imagine the CEO of Exxon on stage asking What Kind of Environment Do We Want? The pundits would say &quot;see there's nothing to worry about, Exxon wants the best for us.&quot; And of course they don't. Not their job.</description>

			<description>Also I see what she did there. Sandberg asks what kind of internet do &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; want. Hah. As if what we want has anything to do with it. They hire good PR consultants and speech writers at Facebook. The best. Remember, never automatically &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/09/08/hillaryGoToWestWingDebatePrepSchool.html&quot;&gt;accept the premise&lt;/a&gt; of a question.</description>

Journalism should compete with tech, as distasteful as it may be for them to create a level playing field where all of us can report the news. Tech had the guts to give all of us an equal voice. Journalism must match that.</description>

			<title>My Flickr photos on scripting.com</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you recall, I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/12.html#a153036&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; for the archive of my photos. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/11/180256.html&quot;&gt;got&lt;/a&gt; most of them. Spent some time trying to understand the connection between the JSON bits and the JPEG bits. Finally found the correlation. Then I spent a day building a static site from all that info, and uploaded it to a folder on scripting.com, which is a bucket on Amazon S3. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The result is 5815 pages &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/flickr/00243.html&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like to hit the Random button and when I find something interesting, hit the prev button until I find the beginning of the sequence, and then hit the next button to go through them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also included a link to the Scripting News blog page for the day the photo was taken. Often you'll get an idea of the context, where I was, what I was doing, maybe even some comments on the picture itself. I tended to upload pictures to Flickr when I was traveling somewhere. To Amsterdam, New Orleans, driving cross country, going to a political convention, or a tech conference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Two podcasts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I took a longish walk this morning up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabar%27s&quot;&gt;Zabar's&lt;/a&gt; and back, and listened to two podcasts on the way, Friday's Daily and last week's Radio Open Source. The Daily was about the splintering of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/podcasts/the-daily/womens-march-anti-semitism.html&quot;&gt;Women's March&lt;/a&gt; along racial lines. They discussed the issues that the march stood for, all of them women's issues, but they didn't get my perspective, and I marched, so I feel I'm entitled to an opinion. I didn't mind that they called it the Women's March, but I felt it was a march by everyone who was opposed to Trump. I was unhappy when they didn't let people who are anti-abortion speak (I am pro-choice btw). And it was totally predictable, based on experience in the antiwar movement of the 60s and 70s,  that they would splinter and drift into irrelevance, taking our hopes of organizing against Trump with them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Radio Open Source episode was about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/is-the-green-new-deal-for-real/&quot;&gt;Green New Deal&lt;/a&gt; and our hero &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt;. I am a huge fan of the podcast, and I have the same comment about this episode as I do about every one. What people want is meaning in their lives. That's why it's brilliant that AOC included the idea that any American can get a public service job helping America transition to the new energy system. Why is it so exciting? Because people want to make a difference, we all want our lives to mean something. Otherwise everything in the show was illuminating, as always, lots of new facts about solar and wind energy, and a general optimism which is what I enjoy most about the show.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today I have some work to do in Amazon S3. I'm just deleting a folder and creating a new one. Every time I go into edit mode on S3 I realize how much time we spend there and how crude the tools are. There must be a million people who maintain data on S3. Why not invest in some great tools for us Amazon? And just think if they were user-level tools, how many more people could benefit from reliable, inexpensive, app-accessible cloud storage. What an advantage they have, and what an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/08/153359.html&quot;&gt;opportunity&lt;/a&gt; for a competitor.</description>

			<title>The Gillette commercial</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A bunch of comments...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I heard about the commercial my first reaction was why are they doing this. If their products mostly sell to men this will hurt them in sales. It's hard for men (and women too) to defend the gender without invoking the ire of others, so mostly people stay silent and let the myth that men are responsible for the problems in our society go unchallenged. But you can push back via private acts, like choosing another brand, or voting. In private contexts you can be very vocal without fear of retribution. So even if you don't hear the pushback, it could come at the cash register.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Or maybe there's something I don't understand. Even if Gillette is a brand for men, maybe it's women who most often make the purchasing decision. Or maybe Gillette is struggling and they can use the controversy to help rekindle brand awareness?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I searched on Amazon for other brands of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=shaving+razors+for+men&quot;&gt;shaving razors for men&lt;/a&gt;, and wow, Gillette appears to own the category. All the ads are for Gillette products. They are the Google of men's shaving. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ironically there are men who take this opportunity to abuse other men if they object. The assumption is if you don't like the Gillette message, for any reason, you must be an abuser. Of course this makes no sense. Today my Twitter timeline has had quite a few male-abusive tantrums from accounts that appear to be authored by men. Of course any account could be written by a troll of any gender.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've written this many times, women have better PR than men.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Women can be awful. Is it toxic? I won't go there. I don't like that word applied to men, so I also wouldn't like it applied to women. However I have seen women do unspeakably awful things. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;With all those disclaimers, I was moved to tears in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0&quot;&gt;watching the Gillette commercial&lt;/a&gt; because I am moved when I see people of any gender standing up for people who are being ganged up on, or taken advantage of. I just wish they had taken a balanced approach. Boys have to learn to deal with girls too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'll tell you a story about that. I once witnessed my two nieces who of course I love, taunt a boy the same age. The boy was helpless. After it was over, I took him aside and told him I saw what happened, and I thought it was wrong. It's important to watch out for this, and help kids, no matter what their gender. All kids start out innocent. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're still listening here's the closer. Every boy had a mother. We create each other. If you want kids to be good, be good to them. Set an example. Try to see things from their point of view. Help them. Listen. Share your values, but don't try to change them. Even kids have the right to decide who they are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

					<source:outline text="When I heard about the commercial my first reaction was why are they doing this. If their products mostly sell to men this will hurt them in sales. It's hard for men (and women too) to defend the gender without invoking the ire of others, so mostly people stay silent and let the myth that men are responsible for the problems in our society go unchallenged. But you can push back via private acts, like choosing another brand, or voting. In private contexts you can be very vocal without fear of retribution. So even if you don't hear the pushback, it could come at the cash register." created="Wed, 16 Jan 2019 15:49:49 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/01/16/154941.html#a154949"/>
					<source:outline text="Or maybe there's something I don't understand. Even if Gillette is a brand for men, maybe it's women who most often make the purchasing decision. Or maybe Gillette is struggling and they can use the controversy to help rekindle brand awareness?" created="Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:00:18 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/01/16/154941.html#a160018"/>

			<description>A friend who's about 10 years younger than me wrote a blog post a while back saying that he was going to stop writing software in about 10 years because he'd be too old to do it at that time. I'm sure he didn't say it to offend me, but it did. He has no idea. And btw that was about five years ago, and he's still going strong. Heh. Also, the other day I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1084300107594588160&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; saying that I strive for simplicity in my programming work. I've been doing that ever since I read the source code to a famous OS and saw how clean and sparse it was. I wanted to do that too. That was 40-plus years ago. Today I write cleaner code than I could have at any other point in my career. The younger version of myself could imagine what I do today, but couldn't do it. So the myth that programming is something you forget how to do, or can't do, as you get older is a lie. It's not like basketball or skiing. It's a discipline. And as you get older, you get better. I'm not saying that because I want it to be true (as many people probably think) rather because it is true.</description>

			<description>I had a change in perspective on the shutdown. It isn't a sign of ineptness, it's an attack on the country. Connect the dots. Who's in the White House and where does he get his orders. Thought I would share that, of course no one listens. ;-)</description>

			<description>I watched a bit of MSNBC last night, and had another shift in perspective. There's nothing more for them to say. They're repeating things, aghast, that we knew two years ago, that they were aghast at then, when they were fresh. The shift was this. They feel as helpless as I do. Might as well enjoy ourselves. We're stuck. The only ones with any power are the useful idiot in the White House and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; of course and Nancy Pelosi.</description>

			<description>Look at how AOC &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1084853760617312257&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; reform in politics with reform in journalism. You don't see this kind of certainty coming out of Tow or Shorenstein. But she's right, and people are listening. Journalism must respond. I want to be part of that response. Think about how an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IndivisibleTeam&quot;&gt;Indivisible&lt;/a&gt; for journalism might work. We have the tools, we just need the will.</description>
