			<description>So what does a &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; mean &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/17.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News? It's a way to tell me that you saw what I wrote and found it likeable. It doesn't mean you necessarily agree. You're also registering your presence to other people who read this blog. Maybe it's more like a ping? Hmmm. I know the Like icon doesn't show up in your feed reader (maybe that can change) but it may be worth a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; if you want to say hi to me and others who read this blog. That's what it means.</description>

Today imho, that's where journalism is at. It's not hard to do, but it's going to make journalism more competitive which is a good thing! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I am no longer watching TV coverage of Trump. That means no more MSNBC. When Mueller indicts or Congress investigates, or if he resigns,  I'll be happy to watch. But I don't need any more on the depravity of El Orange. I know it all. And btw, so do you.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes&quot;&gt;Likes&lt;/a&gt; is a Node-based server that manages an SQL database of triplets: username, URL of the thing they liked, and a timestamp. When you like something, it adds a record to the database. When you unlike, the record is removed. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/client/&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt; that shows how to hook up to the server in your own web apps. I've factored the code so there's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/browser/api&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/browser&quot;&gt;UI&lt;/a&gt;. You probably will only use the API in your stuff. We use Twitter for identity. If you want to run your own server, which is fine with me, you will need to create an app on &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Questions are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/issues/1&quot;&gt;welcome&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I was having an offline discussion with a famous journalist. He objected to me making general statements about journalism. But to me journalism is often, in some ways, a monolith. Yes I know some writers are better than others. And I know all tech isn't the same (his counter-example), but I also understand that as a user, I see tech companies acting in concert. I see limits they impose to give themselves power that I can't have. Same in journalism. So it's totally valid to write about journalism as an entity, because in some ways, for me, that's how I experience it. As with all writing, I only write about my experience.</description>

			<description>It would be great to have one writing system for the web that blow by all the limits imposed by the journalism and tech. No character limit. Full use of HTML. Titles, podcasts. RSS feeds in and out, so it's not a silo.</description>

			<description>I'm tired of being the audience. I want to be part of the news system. Not a passive part. Contributing experience, point of view, ability to write, and hope for our species to survive. To pass on what I know. To help. To be useful. All the models of news as an industry are meant to get us to give them money while lying to us that we're part of their process. Our job is to give them money and then chill while they run the world. I don't like how they're running the world. Maybe news wasn't meant to be an industry. Maybe it's a calling, a passion, a civic responsibility. No one pays you to vote or sit on a jury. We have to re-think news on a grand scale. And the news people refuse to do that.</description>

			<description>Something bothered me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/media/cnn-sues-trump/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN's protest&lt;/a&gt; of their reporter being excluded from the White House. It took me a while to pinpoint. I guess they would like us to have their back -- but do they have ours? They do so many things that sell us out as they chase profit. It's as if they've found a way to monetize America's failure. Maybe one of these events will wake them up and they'll realize they aren't protected anymore than we are, and they should do what they can to halt our descent, even if it makes them lose money. Until they do that, I don't see why I should care whose reporters are in the White House carrying the Republican message.</description>

			<description>I was just telling a friend about Al Pacino's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myyWXKeBsNk&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. I know a lot of people don't like sports movies but this one is the story of age, how the coach and the young quarterback (played by Jamie Foxx)  learn to work together. It's got all the schmaltz of typical sports movie. But the acting is so good, and the story simple and universal and heart-grabbing. Old people remember being young. We aren't young anymore, but we have experience and knowledge to offer, and when we work together the winning is so much sweeter. I would like the newly elected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/20/pelosi-democrats-candidates-midterms-655484&quot;&gt;Democrat reps&lt;/a&gt; to watch this movie and work with Nancy Pelosi. She knows how to win. We have a really big problem to solve and we have to work together to solve it. If we don't work together, we'll die as individuals.</description>

			<title>Journalism's line separating us from them</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think the problem with journalism in 2018 is that it relies on a centralized model, journalists who are paid salaries and everyone else  who pays to read what the salaried journalists produce. It's not all the way there yet, but it's close. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But -- who really wants to read what the paid journalists write? And why? And what about the knowledge and perspectives of the readers, why are they wasted in this model? I understand why they were wasted in the pre-Internet world, because the cost of distribution was prohibitive, but that's no longer an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The standard answer, which I don't disagree with is how do you separate the wheat from the chaff? The repetitive rote stuff that just echoes what a few opinion leaders put out there versus original insights that could help us solve problems? But how does the system do it now? The columnists are very predictable, they're mostly rehashing the same themes over and over, applied to different events. And as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Taibbi&quot;&gt;Matt Taibbi&lt;/a&gt; says so well in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-church-of-averageness-continued&quot;&gt;paywalled piece&lt;/a&gt; (somehow accidentally I was allowed to read it) most of what they talk about in the news is pure bullshit. We knew that, but it's nice to hear someone on the other side of the paywall say it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately that model is going to break because of their inability to do the corner-turn that the new technology has required of them since the web opened up. The turn is this: stop paying writers, and figure out how to find the good stuff in a sea of bullshit. The same problem everyone has and no one has an answer to. The news org that has the courage to tackle that problem, and solves it, will lead the consolidation, which will imho happen very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been making a lot of phone calls lately on my iPhone (6, iOS 12.1), and the volume on the calls is way too low. I have to force the phone to my ear and it still needs to be louder. I've turned the volume on the phone all the way up. What can I do? (Update: Heres'a a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iphonetopics.com/iphone-6-plus-volume/&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of things I tried. I think the volume went up. I'll find out for sure on my next phone conversation.)</description>

			<description>A request for news media. If the president makes a proclamation re something he has no power over, that's the story, if you want to report anything.

			<description>I changed the way the thumb works in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/102&quot;&gt;Like&lt;/a&gt;. Now, when you click the thumb, it fills in, when you click it again it toggles to being open. It used to flip to down. This was confusing. Now it doesn't flip, it's always up. I think this feels better, burns fewer braincells.</description>

			<title>Tweet chat with Om</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just had a brief chat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/om&quot;&gt;Om&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. Here's what I said.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I liked your &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/om/status/1061627707849654272&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the blogger who tells her story. I saw Matt Haughey post something the other day lamenting there weren't more bloggers. I responded that there aren't that many bloggers. We're different.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I thought, if this were an industry we would have a PR firm that made sure we were included in important discussions, about law, policy, society, culture.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's one of the things that's wrong. We develop great stuff, then the pros come in, take it over, miss the point, and drive it in the wrong direction. Or forget the roots, or don't protect its openness.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's so weird that I can't even get into the covnersation about podcasting, something that I personally developed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Had a great talk this morning with Chuck Shotton. We've been doing projects together on and off for decades. A few thoughts. I spend most of my programming time refactoring code for different purposes. I learned the benefits of modularity almost at the beginning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal&quot;&gt;UCSD Pascal&lt;/a&gt; had the concept of units, which were more clean and simple and powerful at the same time than the equivalent in JavaScript today, almost &lt;i&gt;forty&lt;/i&gt; years later. Also we had a Lambda-like code environment in Frontier in the mid-90s. Cleaner and quite a bit more efficient imho. I have been modularizing my Node code, but haven't come close to the level of factoring we did with Frontier. No conclusions, just interesting to observe how glitchy progress is.</description>

			<description>A rambling 22-minute &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/09/electionRamblings.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/07/142734.html&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;. Why it's important to savor victory. There was a lot of good news in Tuesday's results. Feel the winning. The political system might be killing us, but America, underneath it all, is still America. Most important, by giving the House to a party that will do real oversight, we re-asserted the control by the people over the government. Whether you support Trump or not, this has to be seen as good.</description>

			<description>Obama should go on a victory tour now, hold rallies to drive home what we accomplished by showing up to vote. Host SNL. Visit with Jimmy Kimmel. Do an interview with the NYT. He's the one Democrat who can't be accused of campaigning for 2020. Solidify the message, we asked people to vote, and they did, and look what we accomplished. When I ran a company, I always made my sales people visit the distributors after we shipped a hit product. It wasn't for sales, it was to soak of the feeling of winning.</description>
