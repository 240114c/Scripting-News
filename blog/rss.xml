			<title>Porzingas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Is it worth it being a fan of sports? Yesterday in NYC we learned first that Kristaps Porzingas, our young star, was not convinced that the culture of the Knicks had changed. Then minutes later, rumors of a trade to Dallas, a move that just clears cap space, that doesn't get the Knicks a star that's comparable in any way to the one we're giving up.  A few minutes later the deal is confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a shock. Then after letting it settle in a bit, I realized how much I had looked forward to seeing him blossom as a Knick. That all the young players the team was accumulating and developing were his team to lead, and it wasn't good enough for him. After a few years of him saying how much he loved New York, he goes to Dallas of all places, because they have a player there he'd like to play with. The ones we drafted, for him, weren't good enough, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks are not the Mets. I can handle the Mets sucking year after year, because eventually they pull it together and make history, again. There's something to hope for, to root for. But the Knicks are mired, ever since they dealt the whole roster to Denver to get Melo. Ever since then it's been one &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/02/25/meloLin.gif&quot;&gt;disappointment&lt;/a&gt;, mostly self-inflicted, after another. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I wrote this for a friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015 a friend was going through a tough time. The bottom had dropped out of his tech industry life. It had happened to me. I gave him the advice that worked for me, that helped me go on after my dreams of grandeur had been revealed to be foolish. I posted it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/887204091486997?notif_id=1549026273419642&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for some reason, which proves I guess that despite what so many say, it has or at least had a purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a friend who's going thru a familiar struggle. I have some advice that's imho worth sharing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Go some place natural. Alone. Where no one knows you or who you know. Subtract everything that defines you as a pundit or friend of the rich and famous. No gadgets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Swim. Get massaged. Try being quiet. Talk about your childhood. Find yourself, the person you've been hiding from.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Just be another random person, one of seven billion, because that is the truth. That is who you are. Who I am. Who everyone is. When you really feel it a weight comes off. None of this shit matters.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm rewatching The Sopranos. The first few seasons were uneven, but by the end of Season 5 it was great. The last two episodes were magnificent. Dramatic, moving, with a lot of comedy (I hadn't remembered how many laughs there were in the show). Outstanding characters. The best writing. Virtuoso acting.</description>

			<title>The real American Dream</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We need to revise &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream&quot;&gt;The American Dream&lt;/a&gt; because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/01/30/howard_schultz_im_a_billionaire_i_thought_that_was_the_american_dream.html&quot;&gt;Howard Shultz&lt;/a&gt; seems to think he is the model of it. Fact is that most of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html&quot;&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; he has is of no use to him. It can't buy him more time, he's still just one person. He can buy good health care, but he can't buy good health. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I reject that The American Dream is creating soul-crushing wealth, the expectation that wealth entitles you to anything you want at any cost for everyone else. We're entering the climate crisis with no hope of surviving it if that's our view of the dream.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzRg--jhO8g&quot;&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt; came closer than Schultz. Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Once you've achieved financial independence, try to be the change you seek, not to buy it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I accepted an invitation to speak at a future-of-news conference. Like all other such conferences it's sponsored by at least one big &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;tech company&lt;/a&gt;. They get their name on the program, and presumably a booth in the hallway. Probably a session or two focused on their role in the future-of-news ecosystem. And they have a more insidious effect, their presence makes sure that speakers don't criticize them too much, because they're all hoping to get some of the money they've earmarked to support struggling news orgs. I am also the only non-professional speaker, the only blogger, the only user of news. My experience with these conferences is awful. People are polite enough when I speak, but nothing comes of it. I never get invited back. This morning I wonder why I accepted.</description>

I never get invited back. This morning I wonder why I accepted." created="Wed, 30 Jan 2019 15:25:32 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/01/30.html#a152532"/>

			<description>Many years ago at a tech conference, either &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Alsop.html&quot;&gt;Stewart's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson&quot;&gt;Esther's&lt;/a&gt;, I was seated at lunch next to the founder of a sneaker company that had either gone public or sold out leaving the founder very wealthy, in today's terms, he was probably worth billions of dollars. I had recently had my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_event&quot;&gt;liquidity event&lt;/a&gt;, so of course we were talking about money, and he volunteered that it was impossible to live for less than $20 million a year. I looked at him for a sign of irony or other form of humor but he appeared serious. I asked if he was serious, and he repeated the claim. I said, pointing to everyone at the table, &quot;Every one of these people is spending less than $20 million a year.&quot; He was not impressed. I pointed to the waiters and said they're not spending $20 million a year. Nothing could dislodge his belief. To this day I wonder if it was some form of performance art or is it possible that so much money could make someone so detached from normal people that they actually believe something like that.</description>

			<description>Over at Galley, which is a new community at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjr.org/&quot;&gt;CJR&lt;/a&gt;, they asked me what I thought Twitter could do to make things better. Of course I had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://galley.cjr.org/public/conversations/-LXLajqoXhQjUHg5EbAe&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; ready to go. BTW, this is what I've been talking about. Opening the door to your pub to non-journalists. Next step is to gather links to feeds people in the community read and join them together into a river. But this is an &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; first step.</description>

			<description>Also, Om's idea of what digital media is is not the same as mine. I never needed clicks to justify my writing. I didn't get paid for it, so no one could lay me off. There's lots of digital media that has nothing to do with emulating news orgs that predate the web.</description>

Or who likes you. You are about to eat the best meal possible. You can't be richer than that.

			<description>Today is my maternal grandfather's birthday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rudykiesler.com/&quot;&gt;Rudy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;. I don't remember what year he was born, perhaps 1908? But I will likely never forget the day he was born. I also remember my paternal grandfather's birthday -- May 1, 1899. One day before mine (in 1955). I don't remember my father's birthday, there was always confusion about it. There was his real birthday and his official birthday which was transcribed incorrectly at Ellis Island when they emigrated.</description>

			<description>You know how Twitch lets you watch people program? I've never wanted to do that, it would make me too self-conscious, break the trance. Programming is a deeply meditative thing for me. Not something I'd want to do for an audience. But I realized after doing a project in GitHub from the beginning, that this is a much more meaningful kind of performance. You can watch the building go up over many programming sessions. Starting with the most basic stuff, to stress tests and docs. It's all there in the (still private) repo.</description>

			<title>Dave's howto for MySQL on Mac</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is how you start from scratch with MySQL on the Mac, assuming all you want is the same experience as what you have on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; and install the package from mysql.com. In the process you will choose a password for the root user.  This is important.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the Mac system settings app, there should be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/27/mySqlControlPanel.png&quot;&gt;new panel&lt;/a&gt; for MySQL. Open it and be sure MySQL is started. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In a new Terminal window: &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;cd /usr/local/mysql/bin&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;sudo mysql --password&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It will ask for two passwords, your Mac system password to authenticate as root, and the password you chose for MySql in the first step. Once you enter both correctly you'll be able to type SQL commands. From here it should behave just like Linux. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/108&quot;&gt;Scott Hanson&lt;/a&gt; for the outstanding support, as always.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another thing most people don't get. Developing platforms even before you roll them out, takes a lot of time. People think about platforms as if you could imagine a movie like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)&quot;&gt;Titanic&lt;/a&gt; one day, and have it in the theaters in a month or two. Platforms take time.</description>

			<description>On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/podcasts/the-daily/covington-nathan-phillips.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; Daily podcast they went through the confusion about the kids who appeared to be harassing the Native American veteran singing at the Lincoln Memorial. The lesson we keep learning is that you can't always tell what happened considering only one or two points of view. This is the mistake journalism keeps making, assuming there's a Democrat and Republican view and nothing else. They miss a lot of other points of view that matter, such as the view of their readers/viewers. We're not in DC, and we're not running for president, and we're not going to win or lose, but we still need info. Isn't that why you all do the news?? In the Wilbur Ross story they omitted important information. They wanted to make Ross look bad, but actually he was making a good point. Maybe run a piece for the furloughed employees listing their options, which I'm learning (through my tweet below, not through the news) are developing. A smaller point, but also important, sometimes people we don't like say things that are true and important.</description>

			<title>Idea: A paywall you can buy out</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hate paywalls. I pay to get through two of them, the NY Times and the Washington Post. If I were going to pay for others, I would certainly add New York Magazine, primarily for one columnist, Jonathan Chait, who writes a large number of (imho) must-read columns. Like the one he wrote today about the Republican way of hostage-taking, and how you just can't give into it. I remember very well how, during the Obama Administration, Mitch McConnell threatened to crash the economy if they didn't get unilateral concessions. Obama caved once, but the second time they tried it, he learned -- and gave absolutely no ground. That stopped the hostage-taking. But now they're at it again.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would like everyone to read that column but it's behind a paywall, so I'm reluctant to push the link. But this made me think of a slight variation on the paywall idea. How about this -- I read the Chait piece, and I think it's so important that I want everyone to read it. So I pledge $5 toward a specified buyout price, say $10K. It would be clearly stated, and you'd see how much further they have to go. If they never reach buyout, you pay nothing. But if it does, they take your money and the paywall comes down, for this article. Everyone can read it for free. Next time he writes a column, it gets a new countdown and perhaps a new price. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you get the benefit of a paywall, which most readers probably hate, and a way to make it come down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
