			<description>My friend Yvonne was storing a bunch of boxes for me in Berkeley, and now that I have a house again, she shipped eleven boxes to me via Fedex (see below). I started going through them today and I'm so glad we did this. I had no idea what was in the boxes. I had a vague idea that it was junk, but it was not junk. First I found three quilts my mom made for me. Two of them in really good shape. The third had been chewed by my dog, Bon Bon, back when I lived in Woodside, CA in the early 90s. There were tons of pictures, the old kind, made with film cameras. Friends and relatives long gone, or now much older. Memories. Love and regrets, happy times and sadness, stored in boxes on paper. It all comes flooding back. And notebooks from when I was in grade school. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/05/iAmABoy.png&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; from one of them, in 1962, where I'm practicing the most basic writing. Funny thing I remember what this felt like as a seven year old. I loved learning then. We're programmed that way I guess.</description>

			<description>Every so often I get tagged in someone's lament about how no one uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. It's not true. It's one of those things you can't use alone, because it depends on your news sources supporting it. I get most of my news via my rivers, which of course are just aggregations of RSS feeds. I imagine the rivers will survive me. At some point it may not be a fire hose, it may be the way the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2014/05/19/a-sacred-reunion-the-colorado-river-returns-to-the-sea/&quot;&gt;Colorado River&lt;/a&gt; flows into the ocean, but I think I will never see the day that RSS is gone. It does its work quietly, unlike Twitter or Facebook. It doesn't steal your personal info. Or support Russian hackers. It's quiet. That's okay with me. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW before Russians hacked our meme ecosystem, Google was doing it, and before them Sun, Microsoft, Apple and IBM. Google always felt threatened by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. They encircled it and then cut it off. They quietly got their shills in the tech press to talk about its demise. To slam me personally. It's an insidious thing. They still do it. Usually through cutouts, journalists and consultants, and sometimes Google employees. Big tech companies hate open formats and protocols, because they evolve independently of them. They feel they must control everything. It's not smart, wise or even realisitic, but after decades of existing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/in--the--wake--of&quot;&gt;wake&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bigco&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;bigco's&lt;/a&gt; I know it's as inevitable as the sunset and sunrise cycle. Eventually the lack of flexibility marginalizes the big company, but they don't die, they just keep polluting, they buy politicians and we have to live with the result.</description>

			<title>Speaker Pelosi kicks ass</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;“I think the President is a coward when it comes to helping our kids who are afraid of gun violence. I think he is cruel when he doesn’t deal with helping our dreamers of which we are very proud. I think he is in denial about the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, that is about the election. Take it up in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is about Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the President’s violation of his oath of office.”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fedex impresses</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you know I've had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html&quot;&gt;trouble with UPS&lt;/a&gt;, so I figured when Fedex was set to do a big delivery to my house just after a 1.5 foot snow in the area, that they would never get one of their big delivery trucks down the road to my house, and I'd end up driving somewhere to pick up the packages. But yesterday afternoon there was a knock on the door, and there was the Fedex guy with my packages. Smiling. I couldn't believe it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The truck said Hertz, not Fedex. It was a small AWD vehicle. He said when they came to deliver the stuff a day before they realized their big truck wouldn't make it down the orad, so they rented a smaller truck and drove that to my house with my package. He said we like to go the extra mile. Yes, they surely do! Compared to UPS, which has basically the same policy, trust the driver, but the ethos of this driver compared to whoever made the call at UPS (basically the customer can fuck off) was night and day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hat's off to Fedex. You win this contest, hands down. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was driving while listening to the Judiciary Committee testimony. During a break the NPR commentators spoke. Endless Republican spin, even though most of what we had heard at that point was very favorable to impeachment. Eloquent and passionate. A real education. At that point Turley had barely spoken, but all they did was make his points over and over. No question at this point NPR is Republican. Disgusting to me because I am most definitely not Republican. I need another source of news. WNYC which is generally good should consider breaking off from NPR if that's possible.</description>

			<description>Something bothered me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/&quot;&gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt;, and the direction &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; is going in, and of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. Finally figured it out. I don't like tech companies imposing rules on writers. I may hate what pubs do with their tracking code and paywalls, but I hate what the tech industry is doing to oppose that, more. Maybe if Brave came out of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic&quot;&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; I would like it better, but it came from Silicon Valley, from the former CEO of Mozilla. A club of high &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22programming+priesthood%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; of tech and their bankers who see us as the little people, when we're not ignored, to be treated with disdain and disrespect. They know what's best for us. It's like that old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHhrZgojY1Q&quot;&gt;Who song&lt;/a&gt;, meet the new boss same as the old boss. The web was about freedom, and that required a weak tech industry. I hope, if they control it as it appears they do, something wonderful and free rises to replace them.</description>

			<description>Chrome keeps coming up with new things to complain about my sites. I ignore them. I wonder how many web devs pay attention to Google's complaints?</description>

			<description>I had a little health scare a few weeks ago. As you may know, I broke a rib in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a125931&quot;&gt;bike accident&lt;/a&gt; in September. Mostly healed now. I had to go in for an X-ray and my doctor said there was a shadow that she didn't like. I should go for a CT-scan she said, let's find out what's going on. If it's lung cancer, that's good news, she said, we found it early and it's probably treatable. If we wait for symptoms then it's often not treatable. I smoked for 31 years, she reminded me, in case I was feeling sorry for myself. Heh. So I scheduled the test, had a couple of weeks to think about it. I was obsessed. Maybe she knows and isn't saying until she's absolutely sure. I was convinced that was it, and my life was about to change to the life of a cancer patient. I know a little about it because like pretty much everyone I know people who have cancer. My father died from it. Anyway, no cancer. Knock wood. But I had the benefit of &lt;i&gt;thinking&lt;/i&gt; I had it. So I got that experience, without the awful chemo and radiation and possible dying. I feel very lucky. I decided to tell this story now to give you an idea why I don't care that Chrome hates my websites. I do what my doctor says, mostly -- I don't give a shit what Google wants me to do. As Logan Roy &lt;a href=&quot;https://uproxx.com/tv/succession-hbo-f-ck-off-breakdown/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, have a nice day. ;-)</description>

			<description>Vulture has a list of lists of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/best-tv-shows-2019.html&quot;&gt;best TV shows of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. I find some of their choices hard to fathom. Deadwood Movie was awful, imho -- and it wasn't a TV show, yet it's on a list. Anyway I'd love to have a list of all the shows so I could pick my own top 10. Amazon, Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Hulu and a few others. I'm sure I only watched about a dozen shows total, no more, so while the list of possible shows is huge, the actual top ten lists wouldn't be that hard to come up with.</description>

			<description>We had a good size winter storm at my country house in the last couple of days. It's the kind of storm that's mostly wet in NYC, where I lived previously, but up here it was first heavy snow, then it got lighter. So the first time I shoveled the walkway to the car it was heavy lifting and the second time, light and easy. Perhaps 1.5 feet of snow. I drove down the road before it was plowed, having an AWD is great, and noted that someone had been cross country skiing on my road, I was envious. I took note of where the tracks came from, and went. The air is cold and clear, it feels like one of those mornings in Utah, it's the best first moment of a day anywhere. Later we'll be on top of the mountain looking down at the village, and thinking man this is as good as it gets. I have to figure out how to either ski or ride my bike in this weather. Probably both. I live about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Woodstock,+New+York/Belleayre+Mountain+Ski+Center,+181+Galli+Curci+Rd,+Highmount,+NY+12441/@42.0837899,-74.4553503,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89dd0733c0cf4c2b:0xb85cbeef880771fc!2m2!1d-74.1181971!2d42.0409247!1m5!1m1!1s0x89dc5f4e10a1ac2d:0x611c1580c29f8a96!2m2!1d-74.505312!2d42.1322453!3e0&quot;&gt;1/2 hour&lt;/a&gt; from a ski area.

			<title>The name of podcasting, part N</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've created commercial products, and no one ever said they named my product ThinkTank, Ready, MORE, Frontier, Manila, Radio UserLand, even if they thought of the name before I did. Because people respect commercial development.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The process for podcasting was no different, except we did it in the open and no one claimed ownership of the resulting product. This is the way new web standards were developed in the late 90s and early 00s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hammersley could have helped, but didn't. He made a lucky guess, and for that he deserves credit, but not for naming the product. It's possible that Dannie Gregoire, the person who does deserve the credit, got the idea from Hammersley, but I've never heard him say that. And he put in time and effort to help make podcasting real. So many people who poured their hearts into this work got little or no credit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It has become established that Hammersley named our product, even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130410020053/http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/howPodcastingGotItsName&quot;&gt;this is not true&lt;/a&gt;. That's the only reason I object. I think the truth matters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this makes it into the Wikipedia piece on the history of podcasting, if not, know that our system of fact checking and truth vetting is about as bad as can be. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/sacha-baron-cohen-facebook-propaganda&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; naively say that Facebook should be able to vet everything for truth, here's something that's easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130410020053/http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/april/howPodcastingGotItsName&quot;&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; to be false, has been contested for years, however the record never gets altered, and reputable reporters still &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/30.html#a164916&quot;&gt;cite&lt;/a&gt; the lie as fact.

			<description>I’d like to see a courageous journalist tackle &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1201503802735693825&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; story. Why do Repub politicians sound like Russians? I’d like to know. Note I use the word &lt;i&gt;courageous&lt;/i&gt; sarcastically. There's nothing courageous about investigating an obvious question. It's ridiculous that not one reporter has done this story. It's a scandal happening out in the open. But it doesn't fit a model that reporters know: it's not a horse race, and it's not a replay of Watergate.</description>

			<description>BTW there is precedent for turning off Repubs on CNN and MSNBC. They went through this in Ukraine. They thought they could be fair and balanced, that just let trolls keep an attack vector. Ultimately you have to close it. Journalism will do some growing up before that.</description>

			<description>When I was a kid I participated in several &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rallies_and_protest_marches_in_Washington,_D.C.#1950%E2%80%931999&quot;&gt;marches&lt;/a&gt; on Washington. We took buses from NYC. On one of them, I was part of the organizing committee, I was the political guy on the trip, even though I was just 16. One of the passengers, the mother of a high school friend, said I should get up and give a peptalk and lead a discussion on behalf of the organizers. I gave the talk, it wasn't very good, but I remembered the idea. Any good protest needs organizers. When I turn on MSNBC in the evening I keep hoping they'll cross the line, and start helping us, instead of being with us in desperation waiting for someone to help us. They have the pulput. Putin has Trump. Who does Putin's American opposition have? Someone with courage, a spine, and a sense that it is his or her destiny to lead us out of the wilderness.</description>

			<description>Watched a bit of the Sunday news, and listened to NPR. Lots of Republican lies. Enough with the news that gives more than half the time to lies to keep less than half the population in line. We're deep in a hole, and need a landslide in next year's election to have any hope of turning things around. The press as usual has a bias toward keeping everything disorganized because that gives them the horse race, one of two stories they know how to cover. (The other is Watergate.)</description>

			<title>What is Digital Ocean?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At a dinner last night with local friends, a question came up -- What is Digital Ocean? I &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22digital+ocean%22&amp;t=hz&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;mention them&lt;/a&gt; in my posts and the nightly email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I realllly like that people read my blog even if they don't know what everything means. This is one of the big &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22ignore+what+you+don%27t+understand%22&amp;t=hz&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;principles&lt;/a&gt; of the net -- ignore what you don't understand. But read it anyway, over time unfamiliar ideas do sink in. I was tired and too much under the influence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/29/214440.html&quot;&gt;White Russians&lt;/a&gt; last night to attempt the answer. I'll try now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of Digital Ocean as a giant warehouse of personal computers. You can rent one of the computers for about $20 a month, and put software on the computer, even stuff that I write myself. This is a big deal because the ability to run software &quot;in the cloud&quot; used to be something only employees of big companies could do. Now anyone can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Unlike my house in the woods their computers are less likely to lose power or their net connection. Also their warehouse is in a place where your computers, and your phone, can access it. I don't want thousands of people connecting to the computers in my house. It's a security thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I pay them money and they run the server for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as you might imagine, the cost goes down and the power goes up. A lot. They have competition, so that helps keep the price down and performance up. I like Digital Ocean because their software and docs are good, and I just like the company. They are by far &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the biggest company in this space, all the major tech companies compete, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, IBM. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is not an ad. I pay full price for my Digital Ocean servers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
