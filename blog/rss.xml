			<description>Re how journalism is covering tech. &quot;The whole thing is a huge mess. One of the big journalism schools should have a conference with tech people and journalists and we should put our heads together and figure out how this stuff should be covered.&quot;</description>

			<description>I just re-read the recent NYT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about Facebook and I couldn't find anything in the piece that wasn't a conclusion and stated in a way that left it unclear what actual permissions were given to Facebook's partner companies. They need to hire experts at the Times to at least provide parallel reporting so their claims can be evaluated by neutral experts at the same time they make the allegations. Someone must watch over the NYT the way they watch over Trump and Facebook.</description>

			<description>The NYT is fucked up. Don't delete Facebook. They are as wrong as they were when they made an issue of Hillary's emails. That got us President Fucking Trump. Thank you very much NY Times. Instead let's &lt;i&gt;slowly&lt;/i&gt; figure out ways to do stuff on the open web that doesn't depend on huge tech companies. Facebook is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1075732207317196800&quot;&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; from our only problem. Change won't happen overnight and deleting Facebook is not the answer any more than we can solve climate change by deleting our cars. And btw, the NYT's mortal enemy is Facebook. At some point they should disclaim that, their readers should be made aware that they are scared shitless of what Facebook is doing to the journalism industry. That's a fear you and I, their reader, might not share with them.</description>

			<title>How to get videos off an iPhone</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Capture&quot;&gt;Image Capture&lt;/a&gt; app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Plug your iPhone into the Mac using the USB cable.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Unlock the phone if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The photos and videos should appear in a window.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Select the ones you want.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click the Import button.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open the Pictures folder.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The videos are in the folder. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Move them where ever you like.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do not use the Photos app. They store the videos you download in a database. You can find them if you persist but they're in a database and you can't just copy them out. This is pointless if you want to share them with other people or publish them via YouTube or whatever.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Car for a big guy?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1075541500027650048&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/862996047241135?notif_id=1545264878217485&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; I asked for advice about cars.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am quite tall. Esp in the torso. So it’s hard for me to find a car I fit into. My head is usually crammed against the roof. Poor me. Okay I’m going to buy a car soon, and would like it to have ample headroom. Any ideas?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots of great advice came back which I will summarize here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Subaru, specifically the Forrester. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Toyota Rav4.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;VW Golf and Jetta.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Kia Soul (I rented one of these a few months ago, loved it. Lots of room and it's fun to drive.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Honda Pilot.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mazda CX-5.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Honda Element, but they no longer make them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hyundai Sonata.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Chevy Impala.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Toyota Highlander.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ford C-MAX.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Honda Accord.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Denali.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BMW i3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Scion XB.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Kia Niro.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tesla 3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Chrysler 300.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;VW Beetle.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nissan Maxima.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dodge RAM 1500.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Volvo XC90.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And two great stories I got links to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.turo.com/insights/cars-fit-for-nba-players?fbclid=IwAR3W2OGgZygigckC_SoP41yAv6DIpvr67UiP7OlVKFoo0o1PkXDVl3O03vo&quot;&gt;Cars fit for NBA players&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.fortune.com/2010/12/10/autos/honda_element_rip.fortune/index.htm?fbclid=IwAR0yTYSDGmoJhA06VLq48slyG4qMaXiiTzLXQ1S1HVVDupzb1FG3FUDGY1k&quot;&gt;Say goodbye to the Honda Element&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Uncle Davey's remedy for all your end-of-year Facebook woes. New rule requires Facebook to peer with the open web so people who are not on Facebook can communicate with people who are. All or nothing is the real problem. Lots of precedent. AT&amp;T had a monopoly over phones for a long time. If you wanted to make phone calls you had to use one of their devices. That rule changed and the rest is history. The technology is easy. There are plenty of people at Facebook who want to do it.</description>

Not all corruption is about money. Journalism exterts control and influence. Gatekeeping. They keep lots of ideas out of the news, esp ones they find uncomfortable. Show me an op-ed in the NYT about the future of journalism that says they should compete with Facebook. Or a public editor who is a member of the public? Also any industry that feels they should be above examination, and has been exempt for so long, must be &lt;i&gt;filled&lt;/i&gt; with corruption. And of course if there's no corruption, there's no harm in looking, right?</description>

			<description>I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dabeard&quot;&gt;David Beard&lt;/a&gt; at a future-of-journalism &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsgeist.org/exploring-future-news/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix last year, and spent a couple of hours talking with him at the Phoenix airport waiting for planes home to Boston and NYC, respectively. Since then I've been watching what he does on Twitter with awe and interest. He posts links to stories with comments that are very widely circulated. Some of his tweets get thousands of RTs. You might think he has a million followers, but he doesn't, just 47K, though it seems to be increasing quickly. I always wonder what his secret is, and what his goal is. By asking the question on my blog, I hope to provoke a public response. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/8&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the XML-RPC site about servers. How should they handle booleans.

I also have a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/xmlrpc.js&quot;&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt;, in JavaScript, that can still be changed.</description>

			<description>The thing that I like about Facebook is that it theoretically gives me equal voice to Walt Mossberg. And to his credit, he often read things I wrote on Facebook. OTOH, when he quits FB it merits an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/walt-mossberg-quit-facebook.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT. So he lives in a different media world than the rest of us.</description>

			<description>I thought this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/825-8-Reasons-Python-Sucks.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about why Python sucks was interesting. I clicked on it because I always thought Python was a good language. Algol-like. And it had an idea similar to the one in Frontier that program structure doesn't require curly braces and semicolons. It's an insight that seems to have escaped most other language designers. Well, it turns out the #1 reason Python sucks for this guy is breakage. I never understood the idea that breakage was okay in &quot;point versions.&quot; In practical terms, breakage is never okay. Never. With a little more thought and work, you can move forward compatibly, adding new features in a continuous fashion. I wasn't aware of how bad this was in Python. This is an idea that should be discussed at tech conferences. I even have a motto for it. Discontinuities suck.

			<description>Dear Facebook quitters who are in VC or who are writing books about tech... What happens when Facebook does something good or bad that you need to understand either for business or art? I’m a software dev and tech blogger, and I need my account because they are huge and going to be around for a while and I have to understand what they’re doing because like it or not they’re not going away.</description>

			<title>If the US govt were Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If the US govt were a software company we'd all be quitting them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine this. I signed up for Obamacare in 2012. It was great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Call that version 1.0. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now six years later, I'm still alive, I've paid in many tens of thousands into it, and drawn out much less, even though I have a pre-existing condition or two. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What have they done?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're removing features not adding them. And threatening to deprecate the whole thing. Every damn year there's some government-made crisis that threatens to put me at risk of needing some urgent and super-expensive health care &lt;i&gt;without insurance. &lt;/i&gt;I'm happy to pay, it's worth it, but this really sucks! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd quit, except it's the only health insurance I can get. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I watched a bit of political news this evening. They say people are overloaded with news about Trump. I don't think that's what's really going on. Instead, Trump being a mobster is &quot;priced-into&quot; his public image. You all are just reporting the same story over and over. That gets boring. It is significant that he's a mob boss. The tragedy is that we can't seem to do anything about it.</description>

			<description>Doing a bit more work on The Feature today. Also watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Objects_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. Very weird. But it got high ratings, and I generally like HBO stuff better than Netflix. More cerebral, intellectually challenging, surprising. Most of what's on Netflix is drek.</description>

			<description>Lots of writing about the 50th anniversary of Engelbart's &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=50th+anniversary+of+Engelbart%27s+Demo&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;MOAD&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't there, but I knew Engelbart, at first through Ted Nelson's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/722414.Computer_Lib_Dream_Machines&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;, and then in face to face. The reporters misunderstand what he meant by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/000/&quot;&gt;augmentation&lt;/a&gt;. It's the same thing we called idea processing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://davewiner.userland.com/outlinersProgramming&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22living+videotext%22+outliners&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;successors&lt;/a&gt;. Computers, using outlining software, are incredible surfaces for recording your thoughts, seeing them visually, and then manipulate them in ways you couldn't on physical surfaces like paper and whiteboards. Index cards spread out all over the floor kind of approximates it. On a computer screen ideas are on rollerskates and rails. They move fast and precisely and then move again. There are so many more places to move them. This frees the mind up to try out new ideas without losing the train of thought. All the stories about Engelbart miss this. Yes the mouse was incredible. I was not aware he invented the web (did he?). But the thing he was most interested in, the biggest idea he had, apparently has been forgotten, but not by me.</description>

			<description>Augmentation or idea processing sounds grandiose, but it's fairly mundane. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/12/16/projectOutline.png&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of my planning outline for the project I'm working on now. It changes as the project moves forward. The outline structure makes it easy for me to organize my work. My time is better used, I'm more confident that important things are not slipping through the cracks.</description>

			<title>Minding my dream</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My subconscious had me dream something really odd last night. Not something I’d mind sharing publicly, but there is no place. I suppose it’s the kind of thing everyone who has lost both parents goes through. Probably something that goes back to before we were even human. But we are not so evolved that there is a proper online place for it. If I wrote a memoir, I could put the story in there. Nothing I’m even remotely ashamed of.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to tuck it away here in a corner of my blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the dream...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm lost and going back home. My glasses are broken. I'm trying to put them back together. (Note in the real world I don't need glasses any longer.) I'm walking along 32nd Ave a block away from my parents' house thinking about getting comfort from my father. Then I realize he's dead. No matter I'll have a nice talk with mom. Then boom, it hits me. She's dead too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a terrible feeling. I get back to the house, but it's all different. There's a swimming pool out back, and a big guest house. It's dark. I can't see well. The glasses have seemingly repaired on their own, but it's a new design. My father's brother, my uncle Sam, is puttering about. He can't hear me. I can hear him but it's mumbling. I feel okay but lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I seem to remember doing something like this before. Perhaps it takes a few tries before the knowledge permeates some deeper level? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was looking through an old backup disk and came across a few audio clips from movies I had recorded. I thought maybe it'd be fun to make them podcasts. So here's the first, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/15/neoMeetsTheOracle.mp3&quot;&gt;Neo meets the Oracle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite line is when the Oracle says &quot;I can see why she likes you,&quot; and what follows. Sorry the volume is a bit low.</description>

			<description>Okay I'm going to reveal a little about the new feature. You can get a glimpse of the output by watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/scriptingnews&quot;&gt;#scriptingnews&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. And an upfront caveat, I don't know the final configuration of this feature. I'm just trying ideas out right now. You may see features here that are never released.</description>

			<description>A new feature is in the works for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; readers. I'm already using it, smoothing off rough edges, thinking about how I want to present it. As far as I know it's a feature that has not been part of a blog yet.</description>

			<title>Wondering about journalists</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if any journalists out there agree it's worth a shot to train a million people in basic journalism in hope that: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They will become better news users. The theory that people who understand how news is created become better news users is analogous to thinking that people who know how to ski get more out of watching ski races. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Some of them will become volunteer news writers, filling in gaps created by the retreating journalism industry.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I made a similar proposal to the Dukakis campaign in 1988. I suggested a national email policy, to introduce email to students at all levels. Email had made me a much better writer. I reasoned it would do the same for young Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Rosental/status/1073629550570024961&quot;&gt;Rosental Alves&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Texas reports &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/00-20382-six-years-164000-people-200-countries-participated-knight-centers-online-courses-journalism&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; the Knight Center has been teaching free courses for journalists, but open to anyone. In 6 years they have reached 164K people from 200 countries, according to Alves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Baratunde &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/baratunde/status/1072932980123938818&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that a movement is a “group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” That's a good definition. When I think of a movement I think of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement&quot;&gt;civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt; of the 1960s, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement#Vietnam_War&quot;&gt;anti-war movement&lt;/a&gt; that protested the Vietnam war. I do not think The Correspondent which is a for-profit business deserves to use that term. I certainly do not like them saying that I am a member of such a &quot;movement.&quot; As I said in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/11/131151.html&quot;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;the only movement I would be part of is one that doesn't distinguish between reporters and members, that has a level playing field. I think that's the only way journalism can scale to meet our needs and avoid the kinds of disasters journalism has led us to.&quot;</description>

			<description>The tech industry used to have rollouts like the one &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/11/131151.html&quot;&gt;The Correspondent&lt;/a&gt; is doing. A new company wants to enter a market with a few well-known products. So they claim, on rollout, to have some new feature, usually hard to explain or obscured, that made their product revolutionary. The old products are old. Legacy. Roadkill. Since the press didn't care much for facts, and wanted to report on wars, they would run with the hype. A few years later the new technology is known not to be revolutionary. And the new company either gained entry or didn't. The incumbent products are still there. An example was &quot;object oriented&quot; in the early 90s. We now fully grok what it is, it's another way of factoring. Useful for sure, sometimes. But not game-changing.</description>

			<description>Trump's hands are truly offensive. I hate the way he puts his hand in the face of people to hold the floor so he can repeat the same horseshit over and over. You could see it as he tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZtCfBR8ZZQ&quot;&gt;talk over&lt;/a&gt; Nancy Pelosi. He did it with Hillary Clinton. He does it when an interview isn't going the way he likes. It's nasty. Second point. When he threatens a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/11/trump-impeachment-white-house-1058779&quot;&gt;revolt&lt;/a&gt; if he's impeached, that itself is cause to be removed from office. The president swears an oath to uphold the Constitution. Impeachment and removal are in the Constitution. Really it has to be the most impeachable offense there is.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/105&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I keep reading about Kubernetes and how it's taking over the world, but every piece also says it's very complicated. Why? Heroku set the initial prior art in this area. It's easy to get started with. Here we are many years later, it seems we are going the wrong way. Or am I missing the point. Isn't Kubernetes trying to solve the same problem as Heroku? In any case an open source user-deployable Heroku would be very welcome.  Update: Digital Ocean &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.digitalocean.com/digitalocean-releases-k8s-as-a-service/&quot;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a simplified Kubernetes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/&quot;&gt;service&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.

			<description>I'm making a purchase that requires a credit check, and in the process, the lender said I needed to unfreeze my records at the three credit rating services. At first I didn't remember freezing them, but then on a bit of investigation I recalled that when Experian had their breach they offered to do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=experian+credit+freeze&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;freeze&lt;/a&gt; and also monitor my credit for free. So now I had to figure out how to unfreeze the accounts. The bank gave me phone numbers. But all they can do is send you a credit report. Some are pretty humiliating about it. After much navigation, searching and puzzling I figured out how to turn off two of the three, but Experian, in trying to validate me, asked &quot;security questions&quot; that I answered correctly but they rejected. In the process I learned that apparently I had taken out an auto loan in 2017, a year that I didn't even own a car and most certainly didn't purchase one. So now I have another problem. But I guess it's their system that's fucked up, because if someone used my credit to buy a car, apparently they are making the payments, so wtf. This system is so broken, it's amazing we haven't yet had a total meltdown. Or maybe we have and we're living in its aftermath.</description>

At first I didn't remember freezing them, but then on a bit of investigation I recalled that when Experian had their breach they offered to do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=experian+credit+freeze&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;freeze&lt;/a&gt; and also monitor my credit for free. So now I had to figure out how to unfreeze the accounts. The bank gave me phone numbers. But all they can do is send you a credit report. Some are pretty humiliating about it. After much navigation, searching and puzzling I figured out how to turn off two of the three, but Experian, in trying to validate me, asked &quot;security questions&quot; that I answered correctly but they rejected. In the process I learned that apparently I had taken out an auto loan in 2017, a year that I didn't even own a car and most certainly didn't purchase one. So now I have another problem. But I guess it's their system that's fucked up, because if someone used my credit to buy a car, apparently they are making the payments, so wtf. This system is so broken, it's amazing we haven't yet had a total meltdown. Or maybe we have and we're living in its aftermath." created="Wed, 12 Dec 2018 14:44:04 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/12/12.html#a144404"/>

			<description>I noted early this morning tweets from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/windley/status/1072783216858271744&quot;&gt;Phil Windley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChristopherA&quot;&gt;Chris Allen&lt;/a&gt; about a conference in Switzerland where they have an easy way of explaining a new &quot;self-sovereign&quot; identity system. At some point I want to ask the question about how we can adapt the code we have working with Twitter as an identity system with this new system. It's important that for application developers it be as easy or easier than the currently available systems.</description>
