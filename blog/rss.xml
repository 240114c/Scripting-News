			<description>The way to think of Kavanaugh is that he would be a high level White House staffer with a vote on the Supreme Court. The ultimate political operator.</description>

			<description>Radical idea -- Nike runs ads praising people for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/nike-advert-with-colin-kaepernick-has-people-burning-products-2018-9&quot;&gt;burning&lt;/a&gt; their Nikes in protest. &quot;That's what we were talking about,&quot; they might say. Of course they can't, because the only thing Nike ever says is &quot;Just do it.&quot; It's up to their spokespeopler to say things other than that.</description>

			<description>I liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRWsKMjASQ0&quot;&gt;Obama's speech&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about voting the way I talk about the open web. People think it's my fight. They're wrong. It's our fight. If you don't help, it won't happen. And so far it seems to me we're headed for a Trump-like loss on the web. You'll miss it when it's gone. I was sure that Google's trying to own the open web wouldn't stop with &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;attacking HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. They didn't even wait a month before launching the next attack on web addresses. There was no resistance, why should they wait?</description>

			<title>Why the NYT was wrong</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An analogy for what the NYT did by publishing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html&quot;&gt;anonymous op-ed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Suppose I run an airline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Some guy shows up at the gate with a package, asks if we'll put it on the plane for him and transport it to the plane's destination.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I open it, look inside, see a couple of soaked rags, and say OK.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I ask for ID because I want to know who is sending the package.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When the plane gets to its destination, they open the package. It contains a deadly toxin, it poisons everyone within 100 miles, they all die.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037743106240729091&quot;&gt;Poll&lt;/a&gt;: Did the anonymous op-ed writer confess to a crime? I should have added &quot;not sure&quot; as a choice. I actually think that's the correct answer. Presumably the person took an oath to uphold the Constitution.

			<title>The anonymous op-ed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was in a real estate office in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York&quot;&gt;Woodstock, NY&lt;/a&gt; when news of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html&quot;&gt;anonymous op-ed&lt;/a&gt; came out. We all discussed it. I didn't get to read it until about 9PM. Here was my takeaway. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We did not elect the anonymous columnist.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We've had a coup, &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And we don't even know who the new dictator is.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The NYT did not do us a service. They just supported an illegal government. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If we don't stop this now, we will never put it back together.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/09/06/51142.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; on the subject on the drive back to the city. You should listen to it too. It makes my blood boil. Trump is president, for better or worse. The president runs the executive branch, not the people he hires, and certainly not anonymous people. This is no longer recognizable as our form of government. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the theories they cite is that the piece may be intended to soothe Republican voters before the midterm elections. We, the American people, have an interest in Trump running the government he wants to run. For his supporters, they didn't elect these people to countermand his orders. And for those of us who desperately want him out of office, we want the real Trump to be visible, the one who was at the podium with Putin in Helsinki. So we can clearly see what we're voting for or against.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the papers for Kavanaugh. It might not make a difference to how the Dems or Repubs vote, but it makes a difference to the voters. We want to know who just made it to the Supreme Court, while we still have a chance to vote out the people who put him there. They are hiding material facts, that's for sure. This is not acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This has all gone way too far. I am angry at the Republicans, and at the NY Times. How presumptuous of them to let whoever this is rock our form of government without even attaching a name to it. I have not seriously considered cancelling my subscription to the Times before this, but now I don't know. This is fucking outrageous. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm in control here,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUKW0fL-OqY&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State Alexander Haig in 1981 after President Reagan had been shot in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan&quot;&gt;assassination attempt&lt;/a&gt;. This was a huge deal at the time. We knew his name, and he had been confirmed by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>John Gruber &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/09/04/medium-domain-name&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; what we're thinking. Why, if you can't map a domain to your site on Medium, would you use it to host a blog. Rafat Ali, another longtime blogger, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rafat/status/1037371592496570372&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; once Medium shuts down there should be an ethical replacement. I wonder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037372465599668225&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; they can't co-exist, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037372969520168961&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; my own question. The problem isn't cost, or the tech -- it's users. Medium has momentum, still, as the place-of-record for web writing, much as YouTube is it for video. It's a shaky foundation. No business model, huge money already invested. Not a good situation.</description>

Rafat Ali, another longtime blogger, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rafat/status/1037371592496570372&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; once Medium shuts down there should be an ethical replacement. I wonder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037372465599668225&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; they can't co-exist, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1037372969520168961&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; my own question. The problem isn't cost, or the tech -- it's users. Medium has momentum, still, as the place-of-record for web writing, much as YouTube is it for video. It's a shaky foundation. No business model, huge money already invested. Not a good situation." created="Wed, 05 Sep 2018 16:22:20 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/05/bug.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/09/05.html#a162220"/>

			<description>Here's a conundrum. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/05/potusOnTwitter.png&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; appeared in my Twitter timeline. It's from @potus. I must have followed that account when Obama was president. Now Trump is using it. 24 million followers. Do I have to block it? What about the next president? For now I'll just unfollow, but it might have to be blocked, if he uses it in a more troll-like fashion.</description>

			<description>I think there's a place for a simple RSS-based Instagram clone. Subscribe as in an RSS reader, with the URL of a feed. It displays items with &amp;lt;enclosure&gt;s that are images. Wouldn't have as many users as IG, but IG was fun before it had so many users.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlToGitHub&quot;&gt;opmlToGitHub&lt;/a&gt; is a new demo app that reads an OPML file, converts it to Markdown and uploads it to GitHub. I think outliners are a great way to write readme files, that's how I've always done it. I just added this feature to my nightly archive app, and created this little demo app as a byproduct. It contains a fair amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlToGitHub/blob/master/opmltogithub.js&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; that might prove useful in other apps.

			<description>I'm using GitHub more and more as a platform. Part of the reason is that it was on my path. My GitHub code has been maturing, and my project to get more future-safe is progressing. But I am aware that it's now owned by Microsoft. I wonder if they see GitHub in a compatible way to how I'm using it? That's something you have to worry about when building on a corporate platform.</description>

			<title>Democratic priorities for the fall</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Campaign season starts today. Here are the priorities as I see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Campaign on oversight&lt;/b&gt;. The reason the Dems must take back at least one chamber of Congress is then they can do oversight of the Trump Administration. Subpoenas and hearings to investigate how the cash flows between Trump and foreign entities, not just Russia.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concerts/rallies&lt;/b&gt;. The Dems have completely ceded the ongoing entertainment campaign to Trump. His rallies are more like concerts, with a single comedian. He's a cross between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers&quot;&gt;Joan RIvers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt;. He's good but he's not that good. The Dems have the best comedians and musicians. They even have politicians who can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3eC35LoF4U&quot;&gt;burn down the house&lt;/a&gt;. Every Trump rally should be programmed against, provided for free to all the networks. Gradually push him off the air.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starve the troll&lt;/b&gt;. He gets around the media and goes direct. This of course imho is a good trend long-term because it forces the media to become part of the people and vice versa. But in the immediate term, he controls discourse, he keeps the focus on himself, exclusively. Block the troll. And unfollow people who RT him, no matter how much you value their other contributions. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/22/151134.html&quot;&gt;trolls die in darkness&lt;/a&gt;, and that's a good thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Impeachment is an issue for the voters, not the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Impeachment as a goal is like starting a football game saying your strategy is to score a touchdown. We must focus on rebooting our democracy. We not only have to think about the danger of Trump in the White House, we have to set our country back on its previous course. It was flawed, but at least we had a semblance of the rule of law. Impeachment isn't itself an answer. When the time is right, when there's overwhelming support for impeachment &lt;i&gt;and removal&lt;/i&gt; among the people, then and only then will it be the next thing to do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Avenatti works because while he cares how he's covered by the press, he doesn't follow their rules. The other Dems follow the rules. Hillary was the worst. So they could get her on her &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/02/butHerEmailsBig.png&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt;, not because there was any substance, rather because she was &quot;defensive.&quot; They criticized her for following their rules. Heh. Break out, there's no penalty for doing so.</description>

			<description>One of my basic rules of discourse is to never tell another person to shut up as long as I can easily stop listening. And the converse, if someone tells me to shut up, or implies it, they're wrong, and I don't argue with them. But I have an exception to the rule. If a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; is destroying a community and people engage with the troll, I will tell them to stop, and explain, as lovingly as I can, that they're as much a part of the problem as the troll is. There is no excuse for engaging with a troll.</description>

			<title>Tech booms</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The big boom in tech is never what the pundits say it will be. They generally go for the wizzy demo, but what wins is usually more cerebral and prosaic, has more to do with human potential than domination.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like the cameras in phones. Few pundits called that. It wasn‚Äôt spacy and hard to understand. Instead  cameras got smaller, better, and key thing ‚Äî could communicate without tethering.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Few predicted that radio was ripe to be democratized, but that‚Äôs what we did. Not VR or AR. Imagine how much money has poured into those. New media types are the simple obvious ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Different kinds of archives</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/31.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; we heard that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.villagevoice.com/&quot;&gt;Village Voice&lt;/a&gt; is ending, but they are sticking around long enough to be sure their archive is accessible for historic purposes. This is much appreciated by all who value the Voice, its history, and the human knowledge it represents. As far as I know, it's the first time a news organization, or a blog, when shutting down, has put effort into assuring the archive remains accessible. (If there are other examples, I'd like to hear about them.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So then the question is, what kind of archive? I'll try to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine the difference between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/things-to-do/rome-s-ruins&quot;&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; of ancient &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum&quot;&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, and a museum filled with artifacts from that time. In the actual ruin, you're standing where the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Romans&quot;&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt; of Roman history stood. There's more data available to you, things a museum curator might not think to preserve.  It also invokes the imagination and inspires in ways a museum can't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's also great value in museums and libraries! Sometimes the things that were created are more important. So you can visit the US Capitol (a place) in Washington DC, or see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration&quot;&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt; (a document) at the National Archives.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d187555-r376233744-The_British_Museum-London_England.html&quot;&gt;handwritten lyrics&lt;/a&gt; of Eleanor Rigby by Lennon and McCartney at the British Museum, but the Beatles are no longer performing the song. When the thing itself no longer exists, it's good to have the artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You want it all if you really care about the history.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As it is with the web. Most of the content of the Village Voice is probably already safely &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.villagevoice.com/&quot;&gt;stored&lt;/a&gt; at archive.org. But what about the villagevoice.com domain? Don't we also want to preserve the links into the site, for ongoing web sites that point to the Voice? Or when someone reads the preserved Scripting News, if I'm able to get that done, be able to click a link to a great Voice article and not get a 404? That's analogous to preserving ancient Rome in addition to remembering its history. (BTW, some of it's already gone. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/03.html#When:2:56:16AM&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on this blog from 2004 that links to a VV article. Not found. Ouch.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the web we have the technical means to create a perfect archive, but without planning ahead, all we will have are the museums. And we are not doing the planning. The web, as a historic medium is far less than imperfect, it's temporary. Only present as long as someone keeps paying the bills. And there's no way to pay the bills far in advance, so the historic record has a literally no chance of surviving, given the current state of things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Village Voice offers a chance for us to learn how to do this right. So we can do it again, and again, until we've got a method that has a reasonable chance of working.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
