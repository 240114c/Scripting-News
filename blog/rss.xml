			<description>Dear &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1212954848666234880&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is ridiculous. Why can't we use the native text capabilities that all our computers and mobile devices have? This is an embarrassment not just for Twitter, but for the entire tech community. We &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to do better than this.</description>

			<description>I was asked what I said in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/03.html&quot;&gt;March 2003&lt;/a&gt; as the war in Iraq started. That's why I have a blog. Not only can you see what I said, but I included what lots of other people said too.</description>

			<description>I want to clear something up. I do not equate the net with Facebook. However a lot of people do.  That's where you have to meet them. If you want to go forward with them, Facebook is where they are. Why do you rob banks? That's where the money is. ;-)</description>

			<title>When we talk about Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/04/05/HailThis.html#2&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The press only knows three stories, Apple is dead, Microsoft is evil, and Java is the future.&quot; In 2020, Apple is alive, no one worries about Microsoft's character, and Java is no longer the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Facebook? According to journalism, Facebook is a bad place. Facebook is a place you don't want to go. Reality is as the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/yogi_berra_100418&quot;&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt; said: &quot;No one goes there anymore, it's too crowded.&quot; That's Facebook. It isn't any one thing, it's everything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The scale of Facebook is hard to imagine. To say Facebook is like a low-life bar (something one of my correspondents on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/olivermarks/status/1213146774996541440&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;) would be like saying NYC is a low-life bar -- ridiculous -- NYC has 8.6 million people. It has art museums, libraries, great restaurants, office buildings, millions of homes and families to go with them. Two baseball stadiums. Two airports. Dozens of schools and universities. It's a big place but Facebook is much much much bigger. Let's say Facebook has a billion users. That means it's 125 times the size of NYC. The people who go to Facebook are not low-lifers, they're your friends and family, colleagues, classmates, people in power, retired people, rich and poor, from every continent. What is happening on Facebook? Does anyone have the slightest idea? Even the Facebook company probably only has a very aggregated view of what goes on there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a hunch that Facebook is where journalism is rebooting. I know we're supposed to scoff at the idea of people doing it for themselves, helping each other get the info they need, but if there's going to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjr.org/local_news/american-news-deserts-donuts-local.php&quot;&gt;local news desert&lt;/a&gt;, something has to fill the gap. Just because professional journalism is leaving localities (which includes non-geographic locales like industries and professions), does that mean we must live without journalism? I think not. We need journalism, and we'll have it, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Professional journalism does not respect online. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/social-media-2020.html&quot;&gt;Farhad Manjoo's latest&lt;/a&gt;. What a trip. Some of my friends in Woodstock don't use Facebook for the reasons he outlines. Why? Because they heard it from him, or another NYT reporter or columnist, and believed it. My friends didn't find this out themselves, because if they looked, asked for pointers from friends (for example me), they would have found their people there. If they hang out with evil people, that's probably what they'd find. Or if they live with aging hippies (as in the place I live now) then that's what they'd find. Billions of people can't all be as bad and stupid as a columnist in the NYT says they are. And remember that Manjoo has reasons to want you not to like Facebook. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something&quot;&gt;salary&lt;/a&gt; depends on it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Inline images in Old School</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Wherein I report a new feature added yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yesterday I added a new image type to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;, the blogging platform I use to publish &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. I can now add an image to a post that is not in the right margin, it's centered on the page, above the text that serves as its caption. This is an example of such a post. Then I added a nice border, and padding, and made the text a bit smaller to be more like a caption. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism has some people believing that there's nothing good about online. That they should stay away from Facebook. It's not safe. But it's where people go now. Billions. I'm not happy about that, but it is what it is. Saying online is dangerous is like saying the subway is dangerous. But if you live in New York, you probably want to take the subway. Driving is dangerous. Everything is. Life itself isn't safe. It's a mix. You have to learn to discern. But most people are good, and most people are on Facebook. And it pisses me off that a few of my neighbors won't use Facebook, and when I ask why, they repeat the talking points of the journalists, almost verbatim. We perceive the world of today as being more dangerous than the world we grew up in. In fact, today's world is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/14/theres-never-been-a-safer-time-to-be-a-kid-in-america/?noredirect=on&quot;&gt;much safer&lt;/a&gt;. Perceptions that come from listening to journalism too much. It seems, knowing this, it would be responsible to temper their promotion of fear. It creates an obstacle we have to overcome. But they keep at it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/social-media-2020.html&quot;&gt;Stay away little person&lt;/a&gt;. Online is dangerous. Better to stay safe.</description>

			<description>If the NYT covered NYC as they cover FB they would never run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/sports/carmelo-anthony-knicks-trailblazers.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; like this about the Knicks. What they fail to convey in their reporting, probably because they don't feel it, is that FB is much larger than NYC. And as diverse and interesting.</description>

			<description>Speaking of Facebook, yesterday I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1123011587906245&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; intended to be wistful and introspective that some people took as a cry for help. Funny how that works. I said this: &quot;Honestly I never thought Iâ€™d make it to 2020.&quot; Now it's 100 percent my fault there was confusion. Going back to the 1960s, when we had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_cover&quot;&gt;duck and cover drills&lt;/a&gt; in school, we all thought for sure we'd die in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust&quot;&gt;nuclear holocaust&lt;/a&gt; long before 2020. If you had asked me then what were the chances I'd be alive in 2020, I probably would have said &quot;No one will be alive in 2020.&quot; But here we are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Soon we'll be able to write the epitaph of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; as a basketball player. If I were to write it today it'd go like this. Melo is not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;LeBron&lt;/a&gt; and he's not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Smith&quot;&gt;JR Smith&lt;/a&gt;. LeBron is a general, a warrior. JR Smith is a joker, prankster, doper, partier. All three can shoot like nobody's business. Melo is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever&quot;&gt;Black Lab&lt;/a&gt;. He's a pet. He should have been teamed up with LeBron or someone like him. He'd make a great #2. But he was miscast as the hero of the Knicks, so the Melo Knicks were losers. But because he's so sweet and he has a great shot, New York loves Melo.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;This cartoon comes closest to describing the dismay of people who did not vote for Trump about people who did. No matter what you may believe, how could crashing the country possibly be better than trying to work together? I'm not talking about parties working together, or news networks, I'm talking about people, American-to-American.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The picture, to the right, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulpfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Jules_Winnfield&quot;&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction&quot;&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/a&gt; is from (I think) the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRE23YfSvc8&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; of the movie. Here's the actual quote. &quot;Say 'what' again. Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say what one more goddamn time!&quot; As Will Campbell says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Samuel-L-Jackson-quotes-from-Pulp-Fiction&quot;&gt;on Quora&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;This entire movie is basically one bag of brilliant quotes.&quot; True. As I slog my way through the end of the last season of The Newsroom, I realize that some script writing is basically one big bag of terrible quotes. Inserted into actual conversations. And the director makes the characters scream the awful quotes as if they're being tortured. It gets so bad at times I turn the volume off. I dream of the characters killing each other in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVQ8byG2mY8&quot;&gt;Scarface-like&lt;/a&gt; ending. I think I have to go back into therapy to find out why I need to see the very end of this terrible show. (BTW one in five scenes is actually pretty good, like every &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDw8EXjusrU&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; with the Assistant Deputy EPA Administrator. And every scene with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn&quot;&gt;Olivia Munn&lt;/a&gt; is amazing. She's magnetic.)</description>

			<title>We must compromise to keep our republic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/30/politics/joe-biden-running-mate-republican/index.html&quot;&gt;Joe Biden said&lt;/a&gt; he's open to choosing a Republican running mate. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1211775820546621441&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; I thought this was a good idea. Now to be clear, he won't choose a Republican running mate. That would be crazy, wrong, too risky by a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm sure Biden would want a close relationship with his VP, and you just can't have that close a relationship with a member of the other party. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden is old, and his running mate is important because they are more likely to become president. A Republican in the White House, no matter how inspired a choice, just won't work. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, it was a good idea, to say it, not to do it. We're at a pivotal point for the future of our republic. The current president has been caught violating the Constitution in the most egregious ways, not just in his dealings with Ukraine. It's clear that Trump doesn't understand the Constitution and has no interest in learning, or being limited by it. He's going to do what he wants to do, the same way a monarch would. This is what the Constitution protects against in a myriad of ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need a two-party system where both parties agree in the rule of law and the Constitution. Where we're Americans first, and partisans a distant second. Not just voters, but the people who lead the parties. Right now we barely have a two-party system because the Repubs are working on behalf of a foreign enemy, and against the Constitution.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To get back on solid ground, we need to split along respect for the rule of law. One party supports the rule of law, the other party doesn't. That means Democrats, the name of the rule-of-law party, must welcome people who believe in conservative policies that the Repubs used to stand for, but also believe in our system of government. A huge tent. Then, a landslide election, so that the Democrats have control of Congress and the White House and 3/4 of the state legislatures, overcoming Russian/Republican hacking, and so we can pass new amendments to the Constitution to close the loopholes that they have taken advantage of. To codify what previously were just norms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hear you saying, cynically, that'll never happen. Then my answer to you is this -- we've already lost the republic. There may be elections in the future, but only Republicans will win, the same way only Putin wins elections in Russia. I said in an earlier piece, that some friends took issue with, that the Democratic Party would be annihilated if that happened, and this is what I meant. There might still be an organization called the Democratic Party, but if they can't win elections because of corruption, well it's not really a political party is it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To win such a landslide, the Democrats will need a lot of votes from people who voted for Trump in 2016. That means compromise. Which is fine because &lt;i&gt;our form of government requires compromise, &lt;/i&gt;when it's working. So Biden saying he would consider a Republican running mate is signalling to people who voted Republican that they are welcome in the new Democratic Party. And in order to work, not only will the Republican Party have to be annihilated once and for all, so will the Democratic Party, and further, journalism will have to be annihilated too. What journalism has morphed into, where they only know about horse races, both-sides-do-it and Watergate, has led us to this place. If they continue to rule our discourse, as they have, we can't get out of the hole we're in.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once all this change has happened, then we can go back to a two-party system. We can decide what &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; mean all over again, because today I feel totally like a conservative even though my beliefs and policies are what we used to think of as liberal. I want to turn the clock back to Eisenhower and JFK, Carter, Reagan, Bush I and Clinton, where the US was fucked up for sure, but we respected ourselves and each other, at least somewhat, enough to accept the result of elections we lose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone has buried their heads in the sand and think oh well nothing has changed, when in fact everything has changed. We no longer have elections that work. Without that, without confidence that the person holding an office was actually elected to that office, we have a monarchy, and autocracy not anything like the system of government the founders designed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Despite all that, it was a good idea, to say it, not to do it. We're at a pivotal point for the future of our republic. The current president has been caught violating the Constitution in the most egregious ways, not just in his dealings with Ukraine.

				<source:outline text="To get back on solid ground, we need to split along respect for the rule of law. One party supports the rule of law, the other party doesn't. That means Democrats, the name of the rule-of-law party, must welcome people who believe in conservative policies that the Repubs used to stand for, but also believe in our system of government. A huge tent. Then, a landslide election, so that the Democrats have control of Congress and the White House and 3/4 of the state legislatures, overcoming Russian/Republican hacking, and so we can pass new amendments to the Constitution to close the loopholes that they have taken advantage of. To codify what previously were just norms." created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:23:29 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/31/141645.html#a142329"/>
				<source:outline text="I hear you saying, cynically, that'll never happen. Then my answer to you is this -- we've already lost the republic. There may be elections in the future, but only Republicans will win, the same way only Putin wins elections in Russia. I said in an earlier piece, that some friends took issue with, that the Democratic Party would be annihilated if that happened, and this is what I meant. There might still be an organization called the Democratic Party, but if they can't win elections because of corruption, well it's not really a political party is it?" created="Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:42:04 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/31/141645.html#a144204"/>
				<source:outline text="To win such a landslide, the Democrats will need a lot of votes from people who voted for Trump in 2016. That means compromise. Which is fine because &lt;i&gt;our form of government requires compromise, &lt;/i&gt;when it's working. So Biden saying he would consider a Republican running mate is signalling to people who voted Republican that they are welcome in the new Democratic Party. And in order to work, not only will the Republican Party have to be annihilated once and for all, so will the Democratic Party, and further, journalism will have to be annihilated too. What journalism has morphed into, where they only know about horse races, both-sides-do-it and Watergate, has led us to this place.

Right? Well, it's just like Shariah Law or &quot;chain-immigration.&quot; It sounds like a technical thing, but in reality it's a problem they made up. In practice nothing really is lost. XML sometimes garbles stuff if it isn't properly encoded. The solution is to properly encode it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;By pointing at this and saying Oooooh silent data loss. Oooh RSS is bad, people who didn't understand would think, oh I need to change to use this new thing. Or so the proponents hope.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just like Shariah Law is not a problem in America, and chain-immigration simply means letting families come to the US (a good thing, most people would think, so why not say it that way, hah), the tech trolls were saying basically that &quot;RSS is XML,&quot; which their format was too. If everything is done right (a big assumption) you could possibly avoid &quot;data loss&quot; by using their format, or you could stick with RSS and properly encode the text. The latter approach is &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by the time you explained it the people listening were tuning out because it truly is boring, and thinking you're being pretty defensive, there must be something here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had a feeling of total weariness this morning so I stayed in bed until 10AM, a very late hour for me, and decided finally I Give Up. I no longer am going to care about whether the world is headed off a cliff. I'm no longer going to care about anything I can't do anything about and guess what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6rE0EakhG8&quot;&gt;I feel &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now. What a relief. You know what this feels like. When I got home after life-saving emergency heart surgery in 2002 I felt like I was in a dead relative's house. Something I had experienced a few times by then. This was someone else's house. Less than a year later I sold the place and moved to Cambridge where we started BloggerCon and the podcast movement, and what a great move that was. Giving up is the best thing to do. I mean it.</description>

It documents all the new stuff, and will be developed and maintained, according to any interest by the community and/or myself.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/spec.md&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; has been ported to the new site. It is not a revision, none of the content has changed. It's just in a different format on a different site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The original site has been preserved at &lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;1998.xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was started in 1998 and the main work was done by 2001. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; redirects to &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The site is backed up by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for issues and support, and to download the JavaScript implementation which I have been working on over the last year or so. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the big new stuff in this release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The reference implementation is in JavaScript now, not Frontier.  There's a client/server &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/xmlrpc.js&quot;&gt;package for Node&lt;/a&gt;, and a client implementation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/client/xmlrpc.js&quot;&gt;browser-based JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is an alternate &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/docs/xml-rpc-in-json.md&quot;&gt;JSON syntax&lt;/a&gt; for XML-RPC.  I wanted to see for myself how the protocol would look in JSON. It looks good, of course the payload isn't something we look at very often. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A new XML-RPC &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcdebugger/&quot;&gt;debugger&lt;/a&gt;, so you can test your implementation from a browser-based app. The debugger works with either XML or JSON syntax. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcbrowserclient/&quot;&gt;validator&lt;/a&gt; has been ported to the web also.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are broken links. Any links to pages on the old site that haven't been ported to the new site, and that's most of them, will be broken. They pages are still on the 1998 site, and I have the Manila source code for the pages. I will try to link to the original pages so they show up in searches at their new addresses. And time-willing, I will render the content in the new form so the links aren't broken at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I am one of the four original developers of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I welcome new implementations in languages and environments that didn't exist 20 years ago, and using new best practices. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Questions or comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/142&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I guess this is inline with the way they vet apps for iPhones. Can't let any random ideas get to iPhone users. Best to be safe. Perhaps to keep China happy? Not kidding. Tech companies ultimately have to yield to authoritarian countries, where they keep strict control on what the people can read. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50902496&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; can now disconnect their country's net off the world wide net. Losing a news platform like this is dangerous to freedom, pretty much everywhere. Best not to trust them with our flow of information, so use another news platform on their phones, and use other non-Apple podcatchers.</description>

			<title>Flow in WordPress for writers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I write about what's missing in blogging software, as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/24.html#a153850&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, someone tells me about Gutenberg, and how that's the solution to the problem I've identified.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've never used Gutenberg, so I want to keep an open mind, even though I'm pretty sure that Gutenberg, even if it's great, is not the answer to the problem I keep seeing with WordPress, have been seeing since its inception. The problem is flow. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have an idea for a post. How many steps is it before I'm writing what I'm thinking. The more steps, and the less memorable they are, the more likely it is that I will either forget the idea before I start writing, or decide not to detour because it takes too much time to record it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OK, that's the preamble, now let me record the steps that I have to take to create a new post in WordPress. I disclaim I am far from an everyday WordPress user. But I have posted a lot of stuff to various WordPress blogs over the years. I am not a neophyte. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm at the main page of my website, called Unberkeley. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/myBlogsEditorialPage.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Show me where it says New Post. It isn't there, even though this is almost always the first thing a writer wants to do when they come here.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I clicked on WP Admin, which turns out to be the correct guess. I must've been here before? Or maybe I'm just lucky. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/wpadminpage.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. (BTW, imho this is not the WP-Admin page, even though that's what they call it. That would be a page for a system manager, not a writer. No writer is going to seem themselves as an admin, nor should they. This betrays a perspective, imho an incorrect one for most people who use the product.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On this page is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/quickDraftForm.png&quot;&gt;Quick Draft section&lt;/a&gt;. I will enter the text of my post there and give it a title as the form requests I do. I like how the Content area expands to the size of the text I entered. Much better than adding a vertical scroll bar. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/quickDraftWithText.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the Quick Draft area before I click on Save Draft. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now my post is in the Your Recent Drafts list. Clearly it has not been posted, nor is there any indication of how to post it. I'm guessing I should click on its title and see what I can do from there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now I'm at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/editPostPage1.png&quot;&gt;Edit Post page&lt;/a&gt;. Imho this page should be directly linked in big bold letters from the home page of the editorial control panel. This page should be the easiest page to get to. This page also has the Publish button which I will now press.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I expected it'd take me to the published page and it would have a big Edit This Page button on it in case I see anything that needs fixing. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/editPostPage.png&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; it takes me instead. But there is a Permalink on the page. I'm going to try clicking that. And sure enough now I am at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/test-post/&quot;&gt;published post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you accept the premise that publishing a post is the Hello World of blogging software, as I believe based on 25 years experience, there is a method to straigntening this out. You go through the list above and start eliminating steps, moving the New Post functionality closer and closer to the top and making it more obvious in every step. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, there is a very small Edit link on the published page, presumably I see it because I'm the author and am logged in. Clicking on it takes me to a page I've not seen before. A much nicer-looking post-editing page. I think this should be the home page of the editing function. But even this isn't Gutenberg apparently. There's a prompt at the bottom of the page asking me to try the new block editor to level up your layout. If this is the elusive Gutenberg, they might say so. If you're going to use that as its name publicly the software should use it too. And for crying out loud there is nothing for me to click to try the new block editor. I can get Info or learn more. I just want to try it. Help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I click on the Learn more link and twice it confirms that I am ready to try Blocks. I have to convert the post it warns. OK, since it's just a test post, what the heck. First I have to page through a listicle-like tutorial. And when I get there damn if it doesn't look just like it did before. I don't know why this is so momentous. I'm going to come back to this in my next visit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Flow is the writer's problem for blogging. I have been working on this since I started in 1994. I solved the problem for myself in 1997, and ever since I've been working on solving it for everyone else. Had WordPress designers simply &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2002/01/10/dtwsEditBoxScreen.gif&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; at Radio UserLand, shipped in 2002, and copied its menu structure, they would have a much better flowing blog platform and a reader interface as a central part of the product. But since then Facebook and Twitter have matched or bettered Radio in flow. There's a new benchmark. WordPress appears oblivious. So no I don't think Gutenberg, which is a new text editor for WordPress, is the answer. It is the answer to other problems, how to mix text and other elements in a blog post. Certainly a good thing to do. But WordPress imho remains the klunky monolith that it always has been. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, you can do even better than moving the New Post command to the top of a klunky interface. You can move all the setup stuff off to the side and give the user a Facebook-like interface for writing posts. You could even make Gutenberg the default editor. The text editor imho was never the issue with WordPress -- for writers. Writers can make-do with almost anything there. But the flow from idea to idea is what writers really need. For that you should probably start with an outliner, study it, learn from it and adapt it to public writing. That's where imho the real juice is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But a good short step would be to build a Facebook-like interface for WordPress, working with the same database, so both the current and the writer's view work on the same data. Writers are important and for writers flow is everything, how easily can I get your software out of my way and flow my ideas into the minds of the readers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="If you accept the premise that publishing a post is the Hello World of blogging software, as I believe based on 25 years experience, there is a method to straigntening this out.

Clicking on it takes me to a page I've not seen before. A much nicer-looking post-editing page. I think this should be the home page of the editing function. But even this isn't Gutenberg apparently. There's a prompt at the bottom of the page asking me to try the new block editor to level up your layout. If this is the elusive Gutenberg, they might say so. If you're going to use that as its name publicly the software should use it too. And for crying out loud there is nothing for me to click to try the new block editor. I can get Info or learn more. I just want to try it. Help." created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 15:46:53 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html#a154653"/>

				<source:outline text="Flow is the writer's problem for blogging. I have been working on this since I started in 1994. I solved the problem for myself in 1997, and ever since I've been working on solving it for everyone else. Had WordPress designers simply &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2002/01/10/dtwsEditBoxScreen.gif&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; at Radio UserLand, shipped in 2002, and copied its menu structure, they would have a much better flowing blog platform and a reader interface as a central part of the product. But since then Facebook and Twitter have matched or bettered Radio in flow. There's a new benchmark. WordPress appears oblivious. So no I don't think Gutenberg, which is a new text editor for WordPress, is the answer. It is the answer to other problems, how to mix text and other elements in a blog post. Certainly a good thing to do. But WordPress imho remains the klunky monolith that it always has been." created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 15:28:39 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html#a152839"/>
				<source:outline text="One more thing, you can do even better than moving the New Post command to the top of a klunky interface. You can move all the setup stuff off to the side and give the user a Facebook-like interface for writing posts. You could even make Gutenberg the default editor. The text editor imho was never the issue with WordPress -- for writers. Writers can make-do with almost anything there. But the flow from idea to idea is what writers really need. For that you should probably start with an outliner, study it, learn from it and adapt it to public writing. That's where imho the real juice is." created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 16:11:45 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html#a161145"/>
				<source:outline text="But a good short step would be to build a Facebook-like interface for WordPress, working with the same database, so both the current and the writer's view work on the same data. Writers are important and for writers flow is everything, how easily can I get your software out of my way and flow my ideas into the minds of the readers." created="Sat, 28 Dec 2019 16:31:37 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html#a163137"/>

			<description>During the 2016 election I watched reruns of The West Wing and found it relaxing, to be able to visualize a government run in a human and intelligent way. Last night, looking for something to watch, I spotted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/the-newsroom&quot;&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and thought I would give it a try. Perfect choice. Another Sorkin show, a bit dated, in terms of tech very dated, but who cares. It's a bunch of actors, some good and famous reading Sorkin dialog about how news would work if it worked well. I've just watched the first three episodes, it's an incredible antidote to the way news is these days. Highly recommended, and as I step through it I expect to have more to say. BTW, it's available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/The-Newsroom-Season-1/dp/B00CW8DRU8&quot;&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.</description>

			<description>A bingeing update. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/20/211446.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; on Apple, but when I picked it up again, starting with episode 4, I couldn't stand it. It was like a bad soap opera. One word: Insipid. Too bad because the actors are great and they had lots of money to do it right. The story is childish and the dialog is embarrassing. Those are also some of my criticisms of The Newsroom (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27.html#a135542&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;) but there is substance in that show and the writing is pure Sorkin, so it's funny to think the actors are just saying what Sorkin told them to say. Like Leo and Bartlet, Josh and CJ. Except not them, other people. And lots of lessons about journalism. For example &lt;a href=&quot;http://pressthink.org/2019/12/the-christmas-eve-confessions-of-chuck-todd/&quot;&gt;Chuck Todd&lt;/a&gt; is lying when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-disinformation-spreads-according-to-chuck-todd-interview-929912/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he didn't get that the Repubs were always lying on his air. How do I know? Because the fourth episode of The Newsroom is all about Repubs openly lying. And that was a non-journalist writing, at least &lt;i&gt;nine years ago.&lt;/i&gt; If Sorkin could figure it out, so could Chuck Todd. He's playing us, badly and we'd be foolish to accept him at face value.</description>

Now they're delivering packages to the local post office. The packages are clearly addressed to my home, not to a post office. This is kind of okay at least they're indoors and the postmaster there is okay with it, but they are dropping the packages off on the front desk after the post office is closed. Leaving them in the open is like leaving your wallet on the counter in the post office. People are honest, but that's too much of a temptation imho. At some point someone is going to take the packages before I can get to the PO.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've told the UPS people in Kingston this is not acceptable but they say it's the driver's call.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a comparison, I had a package delivered by Fedex a few weeks ago, when the road to the house was fairly covered in snow, and they just drove the truck to the house and made the delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is actually what they're &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to do, in other words and it's not unreasonable. The road is not on a hill, it's flat, and easy to drive on. I understand if there's a foot of snow, but so far that has never been the issue with UPS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;For the time-being I've set aside the project to try to rebuild the original 1998 XML-RPC site from xmlRpc.root. I'm taking an inventory of what we have and what we are missing first. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of the docs we have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/bootstrappingTheTwoWayWeb.html&quot;&gt;Bootstrapping the Two-Way-Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/mailList.html&quot;&gt;Mail lists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/alidl.html&quot;&gt;RFC: A Little IDL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/davesSoapJournalPart1.html&quot;&gt;Dave's SOAP Journal, part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/bdgChangeNotes.html&quot;&gt;Change notes -- 3/29/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/news.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/stateApril2001.html&quot;&gt;The State of XML-RPC, April 2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/rpcInteropTests.html&quot;&gt;workspace.userlandSamples.rpcInteropTests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/xmlRpcMan.html&quot;&gt;The XML-RPC Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/weblogsCom.html&quot;&gt;Weblogs.Com XML-RPC interface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/currentTime.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for Current Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/callForEndorsements.html&quot;&gt;Call for Endorsements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/howTheWebBugSimulatorWorks.html&quot;&gt;How the Web Bug Simulator works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi.html&quot;&gt;RFC: MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/rebuttalToRest.html&quot;&gt;Rebuttal to REST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/weblogsComForRss.html&quot;&gt;Weblogs.Com for RSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogNewMediaObject.html&quot;&gt;RFC: metaWeblog.newMediaObject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.scripting.com/roundingMetaweblogApi.html&quot;&gt;RFC: Rounding out the MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/subsHarmonizer.html&quot;&gt;In progress: Subscriptions harmonizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/mttf.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for MailToTheFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/aggregatorApi.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for the NewsRiver aggregator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the ones we don't have yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/faq.html&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/feedback.html&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/validatorDocs.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC validation suite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/validator1Docs.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC validation suite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/manilaRpc.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for Manila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/manilaRpcSpec.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for Manila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap11.html&quot;&gt;A Busy Developer's Guide to SOAP 1.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/theXmlRpcMan.html&quot;&gt;The XML-RPC Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/manila.html&quot;&gt;manila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/googleXmlRpcGateway.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC Gateway for the Google API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/googleGateway.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC Gateway for the Google API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are other stories on the sites, but these are the ones that have paths defined for them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure what the next steps are going to be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/13.html#When:9:07:42PM&quot;&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html&quot;&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. I knew the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/15.html&quot;&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; because I went to college &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/16.html#When:1:20:10PM&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. I think there will be a lot of Katrinas, I don't think anyone who knows disagrees. The city was devastated. It might have been technically possible to do something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center&quot;&gt;Rockefeller Center&lt;/a&gt; Christmas tree, in New Orleans, in the aftermath of Katrina, but no one would waste the effort and it would seem &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/09.html#a205150&quot;&gt;tone deaf&lt;/a&gt; a term people like these days. We're on the cusp of that. It still seems normal now to burn carbon like that, but in not much more time, we'll wonder how we ever took pleasure in such extremely negative images of how we destroyed our way of life. Another example. I was living in NYC during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy&quot;&gt;Sandy&lt;/a&gt;. I was 30 blocks north of the blackout line, on the good side. I had electricity, but everything south of 23rd St was blacked out for weeks. After a while I ventured on foot into the blacked out area. On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/07/14/142503.html&quot;&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; back &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/threads/november2012.html#noMarathon&quot;&gt;uptown&lt;/a&gt; I went through Times Square. You could see it shining all the way downtown, from the blacked out part. Such extremes, amazing no one thought to turn the lights of Times Square down while the lower part of the city was living in the dark, or trying to.</description>

It might have been technically possible to do something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center&quot;&gt;Rockefeller Center&lt;/a&gt; Christmas tree, in New Orleans, in the aftermath of Katrina, but no one would waste the effort and it would seem &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/09.html#a205150&quot;&gt;tone deaf&lt;/a&gt; a term people like these days. We're on the cusp of that. It still seems normal now to burn carbon like that, but in not much more time, we'll wonder how we ever took pleasure in such extremely negative images of how we destroyed our way of life. Another example. I was living in NYC during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy&quot;&gt;Sandy&lt;/a&gt;. I was 30 blocks north of the blackout line, on the good side. I had electricity, but everything south of 23rd St was blacked out for weeks. After a while I ventured on foot into the blacked out area. On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/07/14/142503.html&quot;&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; back &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/threads/november2012.html#noMarathon&quot;&gt;uptown&lt;/a&gt; I went through Times Square. You could see it shining all the way downtown, from the blacked out part. Such extremes, amazing no one thought to turn the lights of Times Square down while the lower part of the city was living in the dark, or trying to." created="Thu, 26 Dec 2019 17:22:16 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/26.html#a172216"/>

The Republicans have this angst filled â€œdebateâ€œ and in the end they do the evil thing. It's a trick. They find they can get credit for being open-minded and fair without actually having to be open-minded and fair.</description>
