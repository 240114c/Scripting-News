To see what an American city was like after it was half-destroyed. What I learned would inform the people making financial decisions in DC. They're not understanding what's going to be left when this is done. Saving corporations is not a possibility. We should be focused on surviving as people and a country. In Katrina people had somewhere to evacuate to. This time we don't. On the other hand nothing we made need be destroyed. It should mostly be here when we emerge. I suppose pirates could hijack airplanes, or occupy skyscrapers in Manhattan. A question I learned to ask from New Orleans. Who's going to supply the supply chain? They had trouble rebuilding because there was no place for the builders to sleep, and no food for them to eat, and no one to prepare it because they had nowhere to live. We need really smart people there thinking and planning. Yet this is the fog of war. We have very little data on the enemy.</description>

			<title>Using cannabis during Covid-19</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a copy of a Michael Backes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/michael.backes.180/posts/2442563802721764&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, yesterday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Michael Backes studies and writes about cannabis. Here's his best advice about using it &quot;during the 2020 Covid-19 World Tour.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Moderation - Cannabis interacts with your body's endocannabinoid system, which the body uses to regulate physiological function- from immune response to memory. Regular high-dose use reduces the density of your endocannabinoid receptors. That's a really poor choice at the moment. Three days of abstinence can restore a significant part of that lost receptor density. Good time to consider a short break. Trust me, cannabis will be there when you get back.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Find your MED - MED stands for minimum effective dose. There are still folks that think that huge doses of cannabis are a demonstration of their expertise. Sorry, Cheech. The cool folks know that massive doses quickly lead to the disappearance of the subtlest and most interesting effects of cannabis. Find the smallest MED that moves your needle and stick with it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Freeze your stash - Cannabis is more than its THC or CBD content. Cannabis flower is perishable and room temperatures degrade its essential oil content. Freeze and just take what you're going to consume. Make sure the freezer container is airtight (I recommend mason jars, as they come in many sizes and are non-reactive with cannabis.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inhale with care - Cannabis smoke and cannabis concentrates can irritate your lungs and suppress your pulmonary immune function and response. Consider mixing it up by taking cannabis orally or switching to a flower vaporizer. An occasional puff is okay, but only if your lungs are in good shape and you're symptom free. Don't inhale if you have symptoms or have been exposed. Period.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had to run errands into Kingston just now and heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo&quot;&gt;Gov Cuomo's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3h9Z4u4icM&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;. He is masterful. I feel like there's someone in charge who knows what to do and is doing it. I feel lucky to live in New York State, wish we had something approaching that kind of leadership in Washington.</description>

			<description>Now I wish there were a podcast feed for his press conferences so I could listen to them asynchronously. I won't always be able to listen when they're happening. Maybe this is something WNYC or the NY Times could do? Betaworks?</description>

			<description>Rachel Maddow cried at the end of her show last night. I assume for her colleague, a man about my age, who died of CV. But it meant something personal to each of us. I saw it as her crying for the end of America. Reagan was right, government is the problem. But not the way Reagan meant it. I don't know what goes through the minds of the Republicans in Washington, I can't find a bottom to their depravity. It's possible they're masochists. They feel they, and we, deserve to die.</description>

			<description>Thereâ€™s a ticking time bomb. The people who donâ€™t have health insurance and donâ€™t have savings or a job and arenâ€™t part of the stimulus, these people are going to be broke, hungry, homeless and sick. And on CNN theyâ€™re talking about Trump's racist tweets.</description>

			<description>Most times we can convince ourselves that in the immediate future:  1. We will remain alive and well.  2. Our friends and family will too.  What's so unsettling about the moment: Now we know that either, we will be sick or die, or some of our friends and family will. I think that's why we are all reaching out to our friends now, and re-establishing the connection, because we want to hold them close so they don't leave us. It's a good thing. In this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/springtime-in-the-plague-year/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, at the end, Andrew Sullivan talks about that re AIDS, which he experienced as a gay man in the 80s and 90s.  I experienced it as a man with a fatally sick heart in the 00s. After being fixed, I felt like I wanted to die. Weird, right? But real. We call the first feeling &quot;normal.&quot;  Over time, this will become normal.  Then at some point, if we survive, a vaccine or treatment will come about.   And we'll go through the unsettled feeling again.</description>

			<title>From NYC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via email from a young friend who lives in NYC, a medical researcher.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a spectacularly beautiful spring day. I went out biking in the park in the afternoon. Others had the same idea, and it was so crowded it quickly became almost impossible to maintain the 6 foot distance even while riding a bike. The fact is, NYC is just too crowded to make this work well -- social distancing is just not what this city is about. I'm not seeing the kind of distancing you'd hope to see out here; New York has always felt like a human zoo to me, and it still does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My friend and former co-worker's wife is a doctor, just finishing her hospital residency, and they're preparing for all-out war. Constructing tent hospitals outside all the major hospitals to deal with the expected overflow. 5000 confirmed cases now means there were tens of thousands infected a week ago, by the end of this week we will have tens of thousands confirmed, and likely over 100K in less than a month. I am fully expecting NYC to be not only the worst-hit city in the U.S., but possibly the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have listened to that natural instinct I felt when I first visited this place -- too many people, get out -- but it's too late now, I'm riding this out right here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/19.html#a141211&quot;&gt;travels&lt;/a&gt; of NakedJen. She made it to Seoul. I had a voice chat with her just after midnight Eastern. I wanted to discuss a possible twist to her travels. In Seoul, she has a good network through the University of Utah. Of course it's one of the few places where the virus is being fought effectively, the US is a somewhere between a shitshow and a clusterfuck. I wanted to suggested she skip the return to the US and just stay there for the duration. Of course she was thinking about that. She had decided to let fate determine the outcome. If her flight to Seattle wasn't canceled she would return. If not, she'd stay in Seoul, and not try to return through some other hub like Dubai. It's pretty clear now that there aren't going to be many, if any, more flights to the US from South Korea, or anywhere for that matter. At about 5AM, I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/20/jenplane.png&quot;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt; saying she was on the plane. A few minutes later it &lt;a href=&quot;https://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL198&quot;&gt;took off&lt;/a&gt;. I'm happy, I'd like to see her again, and I'm not sure that could happen if she had stayed there. Also, I'm not sure if Jen is better off here, but we are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Renting cruise ships seems like a good idea. Park them in the Hudson River, and use them for isolation. They have all the systems you need to keep people going. Or better yet instead of bailing out the cruise ship lines, buy the boats. We're going to need them for a long time. And will want to modify them.</description>

			<description>If you're a longtime reader of my blog, you know one of my best friends is &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+nakedjen&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; of Salt Lake City and Santa Cruz. Deadhead. First of her name. Dog person. Movie lover. Advocate for beets. &quot;The first faerie off the ferry.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/05/04/thecutelittlenut.html&quot;&gt;The cute little nut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/11/16/nakedjensBlissBag&quot;&gt;That's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2012/december/nakedjen2012&quot;&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, the CLN decided just as all hell was about to break loose in SLC to go to Bali. I watched it happen. I didn't say anything because I was sure lots of people were saying it. If this is what was meant to be, so be it. Anyway, as the shit began to hit the fan here, after Trump closed us off from Europe, I got word that Jen is coming home. Good. It hasn't been easy. Few flights, and lots of cancellations. But -- her flight from Bali to Seoul is at 1AM, which is 1PM Eastern. From there, I'm guessing she goes to Los Angeles and then to Salt Lake. I'm sure Jen will be Jen where ever she is. If she has to weather this out in Bali, or Seoul, or even LA. But we really do want her back in the good old US of A.</description>

			<title>What comes next</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been pretty frank here as the crisis developed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/142306.html?title=ourPrecariousPosition&quot;&gt;early March&lt;/a&gt;, and we now are much further along, and there's more bad news coming. I'm inferring this from what I've heard about what has already happened in north Italy, and what we know is happening here, from doctors, and public info. You can find links to all my sources on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Health care workers need protective gear, asap. This is a higher priority than testing, believe it or not. Here's why. A lot of health care workers in the US either have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&quot;&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; or are going to get it soon. When they get it a decision has to be made whether to isolate or not. Of course they should be isolated, not just for our protection, but to get them the rest and care they need. On the other hand, if they are isolated they can't care for non-medical people who are infected. So, there's an exponential curve operating here. Over time, all health care workers will have to be isolated, or infect new people, or get very sick and possibly die. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our health care system will fail.&lt;/i&gt; That means people who get the virus won't get help. You'll stay at home, and recover if that was meant to be, or not. It's too late to stop this from happening. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The supply chain for food and other essentials is shaky. I've learned a bit about that in putting together the &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/&quot;&gt;Woodstock Today&lt;/a&gt; page. The local retailers talk about the supply chain, openly, on the record. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/#1584550615000&quot;&gt;Cub Market&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/#1584558640000&quot;&gt;Woodstock Hardware&lt;/a&gt; for examples. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The best system we have, it seems to me, is Amazon plus UPS/Fedex. But there are real problems in that system, inside Amazon with infections at warehouses and in the delivery services. I have no idea about Amazon's supply side. However, some of the items I have ordered recently from Amazon have been delivered. I have a thermometer coming all by itself from China. I think however it will be returned by UPS at the very last step in the delivery chain. I hope not. I'd really like to take my own temperature! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I realized how essential Amazon had become I posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/17.html#a182847&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on the home page.  &lt;i&gt;Amazon has become the indispensible company. &lt;/i&gt;It's a huge problem that the president has a problem speaking with Bezos. This connection is too valuable to be left idle.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; has also become indispensible. They are really rising to the occasion. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, for people who think the incompetence here is unprecedented, it is not. Two examples in my own lifetime. 1. The AIDS epidemic. It took years before the US government recognized there was a problem and started fighting the virus. 2. Puerto Rico's hurricane and earthquake. We let the island which is part of the United States die. No help at all. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If we want a competent government, we have to make it so. A lot of us have managed not to suffer for all the crazy shit the US government has been doing for decades. But now it's come home to everyone. This gives us a chance to turn in a new direction. I hope we do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Finally, the trillion dollar stimulus must go to shoring up the hospitals and food supply chain, and making sure people have enough money for basics. That way we can assure that the part of the economy we need to survive will continue to exist. The rest of it, airlines, cruise ships, hotels, they will be repurposed for other uses. For scrap perhaps, or to house the homeless or sick. People have no idea what a months-long shutdown of the economy will do. We will be different people when and if we emerge. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The trillion dollar stimulus should go to shoring up the hospitals and food supply chain, and making sure people have enough money for basics. We should not be bailing out the travel industry. By the time this is over there will not be a travel industry. Money spent there is as foolish as spending money on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Don't piss this away. We need help.</description>

			<description>I ordered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/18/thermometer.png&quot;&gt;thermometer&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon for delivery sometime in April. They sent an email that it just shipped and it'll be here by March 23. How could that be? Are they sending it via bicycle? Well, turns out it's coming from China. We should be nice to China. We need them. They're going to help me keep track of my temperature. Maybe alleviate a little of my anxiety. Now the question is will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+ups&quot;&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; deliver it to me, or automatically return it without trying. Something they've been doing for a while now.</description>

			<description>Speaking of anxiety, I've been relatively anxiety-free since I got out on my own in my early 20s. All through my childhood I had terrible anxiety, which manifested in an unhappy digestive system. Always had a stomach ache, trouble controlling my bowels. Upset. I was always upset. I understood why totally, my parents created a very tense atmosphere, and after many years of therapy and self-examination I understood why they were so tense. But a few years after I established myself outside their house the digestive problems magically went away. They're back. Started just after watching Trump's Oval Office speech last Wednesday. I was already hunkered down. I understood what was coming. What was clear from his speech that he didn't. He was still throwing out racist bullshit. From the fucking Oval Office. After that, I realized fully how fucked we are. There have been moments of relaxation. But they're few and far between now.</description>
