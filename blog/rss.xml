			<description>Iâ€™ve been developing a blogging system that uses Github as the backend. Itâ€™s end-user software, but also is extensible by developers. GIT is itself a distributed system. Shows promise re &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html&quot;&gt;for-the-record&lt;/a&gt; writing.</description>

			<description>Re Democrats ruining Kavanaugh's life -- The legal system ruins lots of lives. Kavanaugh isn't special. I'm sure he's ruined a few lives himself. We should have more sympathy and grace for the Supreme Court. Putting a openly partisan hack on the court means no one will respect its decisions in the future. Not presidents, not the military, not you and I.</description>

			<description>I'm now about as good in JavaScript as I was in C or Frontier. I make the same number of mistakes in my code in JS as in the other environments, but in Frontier, I cruised through most of the fixes in a fraction of the time it takes in JS. Debugging was much faster, the data was right there in a browsable, live-editable structure. I couldn't make a statement about that before because I wasn't as proficient in JS.</description>

			<description>I remember listening to a NYT podcast a few weeks ago where they said Kavanaugh's confirmation was locked in. &quot;Not sports fans,&quot; I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/19/154910.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; to myself. &quot;Nor do they remember the 2016 election.&quot;</description>

			<description>I listened to today's &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/10/01/254049.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Very good. Not listening to victims of abuse is an American tradition. As I've said in two recent pieces, abuse is the context of our civilization. It's everywhere. In homes and schools, offices, Congress, and you can be sure this isn't the first time a Supreme Court nominee has been a rapist (assuming he did it, which I do). We all have to learn how to listen. But getting some to listen is a start.</description>

			<description>It would be interesting if an actor who looked something like Kavanaugh, recorded a 5-minute play where he said the exact word-for-word same things Kavanaugh said in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORdRbReYOv0&quot;&gt;opening statement&lt;/a&gt; but substituted Dems with Repubs, Clintons with Kochs, left with right, and go ahead and make him black. Make videos of Republican focus groups watching it.</description>

			<title>My two cents on Inrupt</title>

			<title>Anna and Stallman</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Masera&quot;&gt;Anna Masera&lt;/a&gt; interviewing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annamasera/status/1046761759476985856&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. She asked the right question. I wonder if he knows that he has to sell people on his vision. But it's amazing to see all those young minds show up where ever he does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience when I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupschool.org/&quot;&gt;Startup School&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto a few years ago. They had all these rich successful entrepreneurs on stage saying how they did it, but during the breaks I was always surrounded by young folk who wanted to know about open technology.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should have a better pitch for the kids, not all-or-nothing like Stallman, and not total rape-and-pillage like the VCs, rather here's how you can help make things better, improve chances for freedom. Because that's how imho you solve the conundrum Anna pointed out. Who goes first, business or education? Well the answer is when you have something open, use it and understand the value in it and protect it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So many people who are involved in podcasting for example don't understand how the fact that it's open means they have opportunities. Later when Amazon or Apple or Google take control, they'll wonder how to make it open. That won't work, but keep it open? That can work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also, from 2011: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/31/whyIStandUpForStallman.html&quot;&gt;Why I stand up for Stallman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
