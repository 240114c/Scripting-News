			<description>I've noticed recently that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpjtCv4vMGA&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;expanding an embedded tweet&lt;/a&gt; is painfully slow the first time you do it on an item on the blog. I did a bit of debugging and found the bottleneck, and fixed it. So now clicking on a wedge to view a tweet should be instantaneous. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>An odd thought. The Republicans are trying to eliminate rule of law. At the same time they're rushing to appoint judges. If they're successful, judges are just people, their opinions don't matter. Why do they care so much about judges then. Also, suppose the Supreme Court says his tax returns must be released. What does he do?</description>

			<description>The thing in tech that sucks the most. A product everyone uses won't add a feature that would open it up to new ideas by independent devs. So you have to reimplement the whole thing, and convert their user base, to try out a new idea. Which means the new idea never gets tried out. First experience was MS-DOS and its lack of a clipboard in 1985. The OS had to be scrapped, effectively, because it never adapted to the more-than-one-app-at-a-time model, even though developers were achieving great success with that model.</description>

			<description>I tried watching Sunday morning TV news, in a time when there's lots happening, lots of pieces in motion, and even though the stakes are high, it's really interesting in the way the NBA playoffs can be interesting. In the last week, we finished the first round, and now there are new matchups, and public opinion matters in a whole new way. And guess what, on CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC -- they keep saying the same tired and wrong things they were saying last week and the week before. It's just a horse race to them. Nothing matters but the election in November 2020.</description>

			<title>Google Reader is dead</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcfunley.com/google-reader-killed-rss&quot;&gt;empassioned piece&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22google+reader%22&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; goes over the top, accusing Google of murdering RSS, when RSS is out and about, earning a good living providing news to millions of people. It certainly isn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=dead&quot;&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; Mr McKinley says it is. But I do appreciate the sentiment. He's right that people are crazy when they miss Google Reader, it's like missing the pet fox your friend let sleep in your hen house. Google was very bad news for RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I started thinking of other things Google Reader is like.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An oil spill by Exxon in virgin Alaskan wilderness. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A nuclear meltdown in the city you live in a suburb of.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A neighbor who runs a crack factory down the block from an elementary school.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I may add items to the list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's fun to hate Google Reader, but it's over my friend, and we are free to do whatever we like. Enjoy the holidays knowing that Google Reader is dead, RSS is fine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's that time of year</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to, every year, name a Blogger of the Year. I wanted to keep the idea alive, that amateur writing has a place on the web. The last couple of years my focus has been elsewhere, even though in 2017, I took a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;fresh approach&lt;/a&gt; to my own blog, with imho excellent results. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a choice for this year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have a favorite blogger, perhaps a blog that goes with a favorite podcast, please add a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1208429729113612288&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's to another great year in 2020, and remember it's even worse than it appears. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My priorities for the next government include. 1.

			<description>We didn't finish &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era&quot;&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt; after the Civil War. I think that's the bug that needs to be fixed. Maybe we need to add a dozen more free states, so we can fix the Senate and Electoral College so long-dead slave owners don't run the country. It's really ridiculous. It's kind of loopy that the first impeachment, of Andrew Johnson, was because he undid Reconstruction, allowing the former slave-owning states to bring back &quot;slavery lite&quot; -- aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws&quot;&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>My holiday binges</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;No &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+njff&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;NJFF&lt;/a&gt; this year unless there's an epic BitTorrent dump of the new releases (it has happened in past years). I live too far out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City&quot;&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt; to get to openings. So that means one thing -- binges! Here's what I have queued up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Watchmen. Everyone says it's great, so I have to watch it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Morning Show. I watched the first two episodes when it first came out and waited until the full series was out, and as of tonight, it is. It got terrible reviews, but I loved it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;True Detective. I skipped the second season, but the third is good, they say. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mr Robot finale. On Sunday. The final episode of the final season. The last episode was the big reveal, as far as we know right now, Elliot and Darlene weren't really the stars of the show, White Rose was. But there's still another hour to go, and the writing and everything has been so superb, they got me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Handmaid's Tale. I tried watching the new season earlier, but I didn't remember enough from the previous season to make sense of it. I have it on my list to try again.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Expanse? I know so many people who love it, but I watched the first season and it never got me. But it looks like it might be a Battlestar Galactica type show, which I loved. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Impeachment. Oh I hope there are leaks. McConnell deserves it. If the witnesses won't testify maybe they can share some of what they know anyway. Wouldn't it serve him right if he tried to control the flow of info, and it just flowed around him. I'd love to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/20/moscowmitch.png&quot;&gt;his face&lt;/a&gt; then!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it for now. I'll keep you posted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think now more than ever that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; is the right candidate to run against Trump. She's from the midwest, and can relate to people in Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial Electoral College states. She's a woman, young, smart, moderate and common sense &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/28.html#a221631&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the president after Trump will be a woman. She's also calm and reasonable, has worked in Congress, stared down Kavanaugh, and after Trump gets through gutting our government and military, we will want an administrator who is not quite so loud. I've said this before, we need a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/24.html#a143005&quot;&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, not just control of Congress and the presidency. We need a candidate who can soak up as many votes as possible. McConnell has to go. But we can't start putting things back together if there is a McConnell 2.0 to replace him. We also need to pass some constitutional amendments. Otherwise whatever gains we make will be short-lived. Our constitution is getting a stress test now. We will need to start fixing bugs immediately. Voting Rights Act is added to constitution. Gerrymandering is unconstitutional. Impeachment is automatic and begins on Day One. That said, my point of view is switching. If the trial in the Senate leaves Trump in the White House, unconstrained by Congress and knowing it, we're going to need a real campaigner to fight our way out of that hole. We will come to think of this campaign as nothing less than a revolution.</description>

			<description>An idea for a reforming the government. North and South Dakota remain separate states, but only have two senators between them. Probably should dilute the power of other very low &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population&quot;&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; states. And that of course will have a corresponding effect on the Electoral College. The voters of these states have been terrorizing the rest of the country because of quirks in how the country grew. The cleanest fix is to undo some of the messes those compromises made.</description>

			<description>Impeachment is not a horse race. It really doesn't matter who is president after the Constitution is gone. It can't be anyone but a Trump. They will rig the election so it always works out that way. As a preview in the last election &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Russian_presidential_election&quot;&gt;Putin won&lt;/a&gt; in a landslide. 77% of the vote. Putin's opposition was not allowed to run. Welcome to the United States, assuming Trump is not removed from office.</description>

			<title>Publishing in a small town</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of ways to publish to the people in the small town I live in. The most active is the private Facebook group. An incredible resource and a good place to publish nature pictures because we are surrounded by so much of it. It's a very &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/18/photogenicMountain.png&quot;&gt;photogenic place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But my immediate neighbors don't use Facebook. So where should I post photos I want to share with them? Interestingly they used to have a blog, before Facebook and Twitter became the thing. They stopped updating. Like so many did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried starting a blog just for the town, but got some negative response. &quot;The Internet&quot; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/06/04/social-media-driven-crowds-garbage-broken-glass-force-woodstocks-millstream-to-close-for-swimming/&quot;&gt;spoiled&lt;/a&gt; some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/nyregion/blue-hole-swimming-catskills.html&quot;&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; places &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=woodstock+swimming+holes+spoiled&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, an instance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/instagram-ruining-california-super-bloom/&quot;&gt;phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; of Instagrammers showing up at beautfiul places and making them un-beautiful, un-usable. For some reason I was associated with that. As far as I know my web writing has never destroyed anything but my own privacy (esp in the early days, omg it was so fucked up what people would do). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I just want to point out the conundrum. We still haven't settled the dust on the emergence of social networks. There's no way to work around them. It's as if we live in Jersey and want to get to Brooklyn but there are no bridges over the Hudson. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish Jack and company would listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/17/151033.html&quot;&gt;my proposal&lt;/a&gt;. It's one of those low-tech things that will have a remarkable rebirthing effect on the web. I can explain why, or they could just do it, and we all will reap the rewards, but mostly them. All I want to do is publish my writing through Twitter, and make tools for other writers to do it too. It's no fun to make GIFs out of my text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want us to undo the mistake we made, collectively, in walking away from the powerful open and independent amateur publishing features of the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Welcoming writers to Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a longish rationale for why Twitter should open itself up to writers and developers of writing tools, but when the proposal was done, it came down to adding two elements to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started&quot;&gt;card metadata&lt;/a&gt;. So I thought, why bother with all the reasons, let's start with the answer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two elements are twitter:body and twitter:enclosure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:body&quot; content=&quot;Limited [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) can appear in the body of a card using the conventions of Markdown. You can **bolden** text, *italicize* it, break it into paragraphs, add anchor elements. It can be as long as you like.&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:enclosure&quot; content=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/14/whatINeedForNodeHosting.m4a&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. And a couple of conventions for displaying the result, no more complex than viewing images or videos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Of course I posted this as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1206954535714996224&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, perfectly illustrating why Twitter needs this feature and has for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Long ago I made a &quot;long bet&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/longnow/status/1206613725005963264&quot;&gt;won&lt;/a&gt;. The bet was whether or not the NYT would continue to make their product freely available on the web. I figured no matter how much they tried, they would wall it off. They still haven't solved the problem. I think they could adopt the philosophy of open source tech billionaires. Make the product free and provide a supported version (whatever that means in news) for a price. This idea has been the foundation of all businesses ever started around software, because like news, there is no physical manifestation of our work, it's all in the arrangement of bits in computer memory. The biggest fortunes of our lifetimes have been made in commercializing those bits. Both hard to believe and true. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I generally do not update iTunes, iPhones or iPads unless I've bought a new Apple product that requires I do so. I am never updating Mac OS because I'm running the last version that runs the OPML Editor, which I use for mission-critical work. The only must-have feature Apple has introduced for Mac OS in the last 20 years is &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250&quot;&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt;. Everything else as far as I'm concerned is optional. Of course I will get spattered with email from people who couldn't live without X, Y or Z. I salute you in advance.</description>

			<description>That said I would &lt;i&gt;kill&lt;/i&gt; for a Linux version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;. Then I could just use that OS, the same one I run on my servers and that would significantly simplify life. I am willing to kick in money for the port. We've never figured out a way to do that, but I just wanted to put that out there. Ted Howard is managing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html&quot;&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; for the OPML Editor (it's a distro of UserLand Frontier). I am forever grateful for Ted for his work on this. It has made all my work much smoother.</description>

			<description>I have a box of backup disks from my career going back to the early 80s. I would like to start backing them up if I can. I think I have a CD drive that can read the backups from the 90s, but the earlier disks which are in various size floppy disks and Iomega disks will be more problematic. Starting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1206589087253176323&quot;&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; about how I want to approach this. My goal is to get the content of the disks up to Amazon S3 or something like that.</description>

			<title>Hover does it right</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to give the Web Architecture of the Decade award to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/&quot;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt;. They have a hidden feature that changes everything when managing domains, which is what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the feature. They let you put a CNAME where an A record is called for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words you can use a pointer where previously you could only use a hard-coded address. This makes it possible to switch hardware without having to keep track of every DNS-based reference to it. You can point through a pointer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's no reason not to do this. Their server is going to respond to every request, so they can do a database lookup to find out what IP address goes with the CNAME and return that. All transparently to the requester.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When someone told me this works, I didn't believe it at first. Now it saves my ass all the time. A feature that every DNS system should support. It's the best kind of feature, it doesn't increase the complexity of the software, and it gives the user more leverage. The rare feature with no tradeoff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Congrats to Hover and thanks from a happy user. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Remembering 1999.io</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A number of years ago I set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;new app&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt; to run my blog. Interesting project, another look at the functionality of Manila, shipped in 1999, this time in the world of JavaScript and Node, with Facebook's UI as prior art. Last time I worked in this area Facebook didn't exist. Say what you want about them, their UI is innovative. Good ideas there. &quot;Only steal from the best,&quot; I say.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I feel 1999.io was and still is a significant improvement over what was there before, WordPress, Facebook, Tumblr, Ghost etc. Still works, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, I moved to another model, most like the one I used before Manila, based on an outliner, and have used it ever since. But of course I left the 1999.io site where it was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This isn't goodbye, 1999.io still runs, people still use it. Like a lot of things in a Twitter/Facebook dominated world, writing tools tend to languish on the sidelines. I still hope to change that, I have some ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A boomer's memory</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A commercial from the 60s or 70s that I only saw a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Camera slowly enters a beautiful office with a distinguished older man behind the desk. The announcer says &quot;And now a word from Guillermo Buitoni, president of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buitoni&quot;&gt;Buitoni&lt;/a&gt; Foods.&quot; Camera continues in for a close up, and stops. Pauses a couple of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He says: If you want me to like you...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another pause:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He says: Buy my pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Logo. Cut.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was perfect. No product shot. Just hey I'm this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe&quot;&gt;Master of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, and of course you want me to like you. And I've made it realllly simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could find the video to see if it is as good as I remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
