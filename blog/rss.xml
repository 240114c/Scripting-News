			<description>It's funny how my subconscious &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/09/04/wordsISayToMyselfAsIProgram.html&quot;&gt;gets in the loop&lt;/a&gt; on my programming which is probably almost totally a higher-brain function. When I figure something out, here's what comes out of my mouth -- bang. That's a new one. It used to be bing and then ptahhh. Also thank you. Sometimes perfect. Then there was bingo bongo bingo. And now -- bang. Sometimes it's bang bang bang. There's no conscious thought behind these words. It's spontaneous. They just happen. It's as if my subconscious is watching, not entirely sure what's going on, like a black lab hanging out at my feet. He senses something has happened that's momentous and wants to participate. Verbally.</description>

			<description>Now the conversation has turned to what Trump should be impeached for. I don't know the public opinion answer, or the legal answer, or the right answer for Nancy Pelosi, but here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Occam%27s+News&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt; answer. He's running a corrupt enterprise from the White House. He's turned it into the Trump Organization, using all the powers of the presidency to cover up his crimes and fill his pockets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime&quot;&gt;Organized crime&lt;/a&gt;. To live the life he was living before he was elected but on a much grander scale. This violates everything in the Constitution, because it was the founders intent, in every instance, to have the United States be self-governing, not a monarchy.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I hit a pothole on a dirt road and I rolled over the handlebars. My instincts were good, I protected my head and neck, took the brunt on my ribcage and knee. It was a private place and a private experience. I laid there in the dirt for I have no idea how long, looked up at the sky through the trees, breathed, and was thankful it wasn't worse. Eventually I got myself up, dizzy, sat back down, breathed some more, righted myself and walked home. The bike wasn't rideable. I've rolled over handlebars once before, in Manhattan, in 2010, avoiding a collision with a car that was running a stop sign. That time I was in bed for days, this time it's not that bad. I'm already up and about. I love my bike, but today I feel betrayed. Not sure if it was really a hole in the road or a bike failure. I haven't had the will to look at the bike yet. I'm going to spend a day eating ibuprofen and being thankful.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/23.html#a150837&quot;&gt;briefly&lt;/a&gt; about new social graphs. Here's the background. For a long time, years, to get engagement with smart people on my writing, I had to cross-post to Twitter or Facebook, and at times Medium. This never worked well, there were limits to their APIs or format (character limits on Twitter, for example). Following the Cambridge Analytica mess, Facebook shut down their API so cross-posting was no longer possible. But now, I’m getting engagement, like I did in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;early years&lt;/a&gt;, on my blog, &lt;i&gt;without going through a silo. &lt;/i&gt;This conversation, the one we’re having right now, is part of a new social graph. Nothing long-term about it, it’s already here. Now the question is what's the next step. The email connection works. (To people who are only following in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, I recommend trying the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. It feels different. For example, if you reply, I will see it. That doesn't happen in RSS.)</description>

			<description>After learning about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/22.html#a181713&quot;&gt;Yacht Rock&lt;/a&gt;, I've been listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doobie_Brothers&quot;&gt;Doobie Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, reading up on their history. This morning I was listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJe1iUuAW4M&quot;&gt;What a Fool Believes&lt;/a&gt;, following along in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=what+a+fool+believes+lyrics&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=what+a+fool+belie&amp;aqs=chrome.1.0l2j69i57j0l3.7618j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt;, and saw that it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/24/arethaWroteTheSong.png&quot;&gt;written by&lt;/a&gt; Aretha Franklin!

If you look at the end of any post you'll &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/24/purplePoundSign.png&quot;&gt;see four icons&lt;/a&gt;. The first, a &quot;purple pound sign,&quot; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/23/designChallengeParagraphlevelPermalinks.html&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; link to the item. When you click it, the browser opens the page, with that post at the top. That's the best link to send to friends.</description>

			<description>The human species has been on a drive to growth from the beginning. The way to survive was to have lots of kids to insure that some would survive to reproduce, thereby continuing our own DNA and insuring the survival of the species. Until the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic&quot;&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt; and mass production of fossil fuel, and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System&quot;&gt;forms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport&quot;&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt;, we were in balance with nature. But some time in the last hundred years the balance flipped, growth skyrocketed, and processes were set in motion that got us to today's climate crisis. Problem is that we, as a species, haven't evolved, our evolution-driven goals haven't changed, we still think having more children is a virtue, and that it's our right, even obligation, to consume more. Reversing that is not a simple matter (that's generous, in my heart I don't think it's even possible), and the problem was not created by one or two generations, as some of the young folk believe. The problem is with the nature of our species, the traits that evolution reinforced are the ones that are leading us off the climate cliff. So when I listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg&quot;&gt;Greta's&lt;/a&gt; speech, she isn't speaking just for her generation, she's speaking for mine too, and for my parents, who are gone. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://eve.scripting.com/2006/11/01&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 2018, was passionate about consuming less. Greta would have liked her, I think. Yes we knew we were going off a cliff, even people who say they aren't sure, they knew too. But turning the ship around isn't something you decide to do. We each can do it ourselves, but that won't make a difference. I don't have the answers, but I know for certain that blaming today's adults for the future that today's children face is wrong.  Making other people the symbol of our grief for our species is typically human, and pointless.</description>

			<description>Pelosi's choice: 1. Get behind impeachment, now, fully, no conditions. 2. Step aside and let the new Speaker do it. (Update: There's a third choice -- Delegate all matters related to impeachment to a special prosecutor, a member of the House. I think Adam Schiff would be ideal. Pelosi can handle everything but impeachment. Refer all questions to the prosecutor.)</description>

			<description>As usual journalism is cutting Trump too much slack. Here's what actually happened, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22occam%27s+news%22+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt;, between Trump and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelensky&quot;&gt;Volodymyr Zelensky&lt;/a&gt;, president of Ukraine. First, Trump doesn't care if there's an actual investigation. He wants Zelensky to say there was, and Biden &amp; Biden are being charged with something heinous that carries the death penalty in Ukraine. That's the first round of hype. Then Ukraine files for extradition of the Bidens. Trump goes through a whole drama, trying to decide whether or not to allow Biden &amp; Biden to be deported to Ukraine, or try them in the US, for interfering with an election in a foreign country, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act&quot;&gt;usurping&lt;/a&gt; the perogative of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump&quot;&gt;US govt&lt;/a&gt;. The press reports on &lt;i&gt;Trump's Decision, &lt;/i&gt;Day 1, Day 2 and so on. Reporters camp out in front of the White House all night waiting for a decision. Finally Trump emerges with AG Barr, he decides try them here, showing surprising mercy for the Bidens, it is reported almost everywhere. After all that Ukraine quietly receives the $250 million, of course with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)&quot;&gt;taste&lt;/a&gt; for Trump. My guess is that all this will still happen even though it's been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/us/politics/trump-ukraine-biden.html&quot;&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt;. And Pelosi still will not allow impeachment.</description>

It's doable, the Twitter API has what's needed, but I'm not sure most tweets would look good in email. Think of the hacks people use to tell stories on Twitter. It would be easier the other way around, to take essays and turn them into a series of Tweets. Of course I have an app for that -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://pork.io/&quot;&gt;Little Pork Chop&lt;/a&gt;. There's also &lt;a href=&quot;http://happyfriends.camp/&quot;&gt;Happy Friends&lt;/a&gt;, a web app I wrote in 2014. It still works, but I don't use it myself anymore. Not sure why.</description>

			<description>Want a protest? Here’s a plan that would get things to change. A permanent occupation of DC by 100K people demanding impeachment. Leave when your replacement arrives.</description>

			<description>I had never heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_rock&quot;&gt;Yacht Rock&lt;/a&gt; before listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/podcasts/1619-black-american-music-appropriation.html?showTranscript=1&quot;&gt;third episode&lt;/a&gt; of the 1619 podcast, which might be the best single episode of any podcast ever. If you love American music, you can, in a few minutes, find out what it is and where it came from. If you say &quot;Alexa play Yacht Rock&quot; you get a virtual radio station of the good stuff.</description>

			<description>Want to have marches that scare &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MoscowMitch?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;Moscow Mitch&lt;/a&gt; and Nancy Pelosi? All over the country we pretend it's Election Day. Dress rehearsal. March to your local polling place and have a have a street fair with booths for the candidates, for causes and political parties. Let the candidates treat you to entertainment, food and drink. We should make Election Day as much anticipated as any holiday. Or even better, usurp an existing holiday like &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hate+halloween&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It would be great if we could make voting a party, a celebration, something to look forward to, not something you have to make time for. That would probably do more to improve the lives of all Americans than any other single thing. It's like the SuperBowl, the NBA Finals, Coachella or the Oscars, only better -- because we are the stars.</description>

			<description>I finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/undone&quot;&gt;Undone&lt;/a&gt; last night. Spoilers follow, so be warned. In the story, a teacher urges a student to be the sky (paraphrasing), observe your feelings the way the sky might observe the flow of a river. This is something I've learned, it comes with age and experience, self-knowledge. I think  you can learn it at a young age, if you're taught and you practice. Once you can observe your feelings, fully feel them, but not let them become you, that's when you come into your power. Some reviewers say the series is about mental illness, but that's only one theory of the show, and not the one we're left with, waiting for season 2. I'm probably going to watch it again, it's such rich story and so beautifully told.</description>

			<description>Scott Love, via email: &quot;I want to star or rate your best gems!&quot; I always listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22scott+love%22+outliner&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt;. He was hired as a product marketing manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-80s, but he was so much more. We went to dinner probably two or three nights a week, and mostly about where to go with our outliner products, and what the competition in the Valley was doing. I would try ideas out on Scott, give him limited background, to see where his mind would go. Very creative and hard-working mind. Scott reads this blog via the nightly email. It's a lot like the old days at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-chus-los-altos&quot;&gt;Chef Chu's&lt;/a&gt; in Los Altos. So Scott, there are features in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/21.html#a150505&quot;&gt;web version&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News that aren't in the email version, for security reasons.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/opinion/republicans-democracy-play-dirty.html&quot;&gt;Fascinating op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT by two political science &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Democracies-Die-Steven-Levitsky/dp/1524762938&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/a&gt; about why the Repubs play dirty. They illustrate more generally that political parties play dirty when they realize they can't stay in power any other way. But -- consider this sentence -- &quot;The only way out of this situation is for the Republican Party to become more diverse.&quot; As a programmer, which teaches me to challenge my assumptions, it's a critical part of design and debugging, I see that it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the only way out. Political parties aren't like baseball teams. As long as there's baseball, your favorite team will continue, though they could move or change their name. For example, the Washington Nationals are the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals#Montreal_Expos&quot;&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt;. But the same must not be true of political parties. The Repubs had a good run, but they went down a path that didn't work. So they lose elections. What of it. There's no way the Democrats will rule the whole country unopposed for any amount of time -- a new party will form. In all likelihood two new parties will form. There aren't enough white Christians in the US to rule, and many of them, esp the young ones, see themselves as part of a diverse America. Eventually the Repubs will disappear, the question is how much damage will they do on their way out.</description>

But -- consider this sentence -- &quot;The only way out of this situation is for the Republican Party to become more diverse.&quot; As a programmer, which teaches me to challenge my assumptions, it's a critical part of design and debugging, I see that it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the only way out. Political parties aren't like baseball teams. As long as there's baseball, your favorite team will continue, though they could move or change their name. For example, the Washington Nationals are the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals#Montreal_Expos&quot;&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt;. But the same must not be true of political parties. The Repubs had a good run, but they went down a path that didn't work. So they lose elections. What of it. There's no way the Democrats will rule the whole country unopposed for any amount of time -- a new party will form. In all likelihood two new parties will form. There aren't enough white Christians in the US to rule, and many of them, esp the young ones, see themselves as part of a diverse America. Eventually the Repubs will disappear, the question is how much damage will they do on their way out." created="Sat, 21 Sep 2019 14:12:03 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/21/goneWithTheWind.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/09/21.html#a141203"/>

			<description>BTW, the radical adjustments in the US political system are an obvious response to big changes in the Soviet Union in the 80s and 90s. People thought at the time there would be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_dividend&quot;&gt;peace dividend&lt;/a&gt;, and that it signalled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man&quot;&gt;end of history&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't believe it at the time, I saw both ideas as tempting fate, the same way you brag that your candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/18/news/paddypower-pays-hillary-clinton-bettors/index.html&quot;&gt;can't lose&lt;/a&gt;. God hears you and as my dear departed uncle would say goofs on you.</description>

			<description>I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/podcasts/the-daily/elizabeth-warren-rally.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; today about what an Elizabeth Warren rally is like. I liked how people were asked to take a minute and introduce themselves to the people around them. Wouldn't it be great if everyone left with a task they would do to make the world better, right now, not after Warren gets elected. This is what we need, meaningful things each of us can do to make things better. We yearn to belong and to do good work.</description>
