			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dsearls/status/1168543203429163009&quot;&gt;Thanks Doc&lt;/a&gt;. At this time I'm not making software to save journalism, I don't think I ever did that. I was mostly interested in tools that make people better communicators, and that of course includes journalists. Now I make tools that mostly make &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; a better communicator and a happier writer. If I had one bit of advice to journalism it would be this -- listen better. Journalism is very self-contained. At this time the answers are there, imho, with the readers and with the challenges of technology and authoritarian rulers. We can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html&quot;&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt; to save each other, but that's the key thing we're not doing -- working together.</description>

			<description>States should have to buy insurance against mass shootings, to fund health care for victims or damages to families of those killed. That would give them incentive to control factors that cause mass shootings. No room for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_and_prayers&quot;&gt;usual bs&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Braintrust &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/130&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; resolved. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/130#issuecomment-527210564&quot;&gt;Peter Judge&lt;/a&gt; saw immediately what the problem was: no Content-Length &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields&quot;&gt;header&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thank you&lt;/i&gt; for the help. Here's the postmortem. I'm writing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; service, the request was being route through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagepark&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt;. Of course I blamed the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; of technology that wasn't mine. Heh. Further, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC spec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;requires&lt;/i&gt; that the Content-Length header be &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/02/contentLengthMustBeSpecified.png&quot;&gt;provided&lt;/a&gt; and be correct. If I had followed my own design, I wouldn't have needed the help. Dear Murphy, I am unworthy, I am unworthy.</description>

			<title>My cat Nurse</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a grad student in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin&quot;&gt;Madison&lt;/a&gt; I had a cat named Nurse. I got her when I lived in NYC, between college and grad school. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got her from an ad in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice&quot;&gt;Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;, from a woman who had dozens of cats in her Manhattan apartment. She pointed out this gray cat, see how she's taking care of the sick kitten? I took her home and named her Nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later I moved to Madison, in the middle of the winter. Nurse stayed with my parents in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt; until I found a place to live, and they sent her out by airplane. She must've had a bad experience on the flight or waiting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar&quot;&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;, because when she got to me, she was freaked out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She became a tough cat, but she still was a very special cat. She'd take walks with you like a dog. And in a few weeks she was pregnant, and in a couple of months delivered a litter of five really cute (of course) newborn kittens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I lived in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://davetravel.scripting.com/2004/08/27#a36&quot;&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0683857,-89.3871709,3a,75y,160.71h,88t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sejrfHkjBYXO-p7iZodByHA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DejrfHkjBYXO-p7iZodByHA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D154.0355%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656&quot;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; nine roommates, the kittens were a huge hit. We all would watch them and poke at them and make cooing sounds until one day the kittens and Nurse were gone. Later I found them, she had camped out behind my dresser, but I didn't tell anyone where she was, I respected her wish to care for her children privately.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then in a few days -- kittens everywhere! She had let them go out in the world to find their way, and it was great. They were so much fun. A few days later, we gave them away, and Nurse went off to get fixed, and when she came back, she came back to just being Nurse, her mom days were over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've written this story before, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/12/05.html#nurse&quot;&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. It came out somewhat differently, but it's basically the same story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
