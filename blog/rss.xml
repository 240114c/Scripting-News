			<description>I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/podcasts/the-daily/elizabeth-warren-rally.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; today about what an Elizabeth Warren rally is like. I liked how people were asked to take a minute and introduce themselves to the people around them. Wouldn't it be great if everyone left with a task they would do to make the world better, right now, not after Warren gets elected. This is what we need, meaningful things each of us can do to make things better. We yearn to belong and to do good work.</description>

			<description>The only reason not to impeach Trump, as far as I can see, is it could hurt the Democratic Party. I have no idea why, considering what's at stake, anyone cares if the DP survives. We'll form another party.</description>

			<description>Some shows I binge in &quot;savor mode,&quot; they're so good and there isn't much to binge on, so I go slow, stop often and savor shows to watch later. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/undone&quot;&gt;Undone&lt;/a&gt; is one of those shows. Two 1/2 hour episodes left. It is of a genre, wild misunderstood-as-crazy super-powered young woman, as much a victim of her powers as master of them. Undone is something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/russian-doll/season-1&quot;&gt;Russian Doll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/killing-eve&quot;&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/a&gt;. I'll know more when I finish. But it's one of the best shows ever.</description>

			<title>Communicating with Amazon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my orders with Amazon are uneventful. The product arrives when it was supposed to and it works and that's that. But sometimes something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On July 26, I ordered an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WNEJCBE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;outdoor thermometer&lt;/a&gt;. Not expensive, $10. But it was broken when I opened the package, and I cut my finger, it bled.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went to the Order page and reported that it arrived broken. I just wanted to throw it out, not wanting to handle the broken glass, possibly injuring myself again, or someone who had to handle it at UPS or at Amazon. That was the right thing to do. The Amazon rep said OK, they would credit me for the thermometer. Honestly I was surprised it was that easy. I ordered another one (which arrived unbroken and I'm using it).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well, about a week ago, I got an email saying I needed to send the thermometer back or I'd be charged for it. There was no way to respond. I got another notice a few days later saying they had charged me for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay $10 isn't going to make a difference to me, but it would make even less of a difference to Amazon. And they agreed to the arrangement, and it was the right thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I thought I'd write it up &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. Maybe someone in an executive role at Amazon will see it, and will change their system so it's easier for customers to talk to them, and make sure when they agree to something, they stick to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In the evening I make orange juice from concentrate to drink, with ice, while watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#2&quot;&gt;Mets&lt;/a&gt;. I leave about 1/2 glass for the morning, when I throw in frozen fruit, a heaping tablespoon of yogurt and a bit of warm water, and zap it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBQ1AIG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;blender&lt;/a&gt;. Pour it into a big glass and sip it for an hour or so while I write in the morning. It's delicious, cold, tasty and nutritious. I feel very loved.</description>

			<title>Advice for Stallman</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman's&lt;/a&gt; PR person, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sylviapaull.com/&quot;&gt;Sylvia Paull&lt;/a&gt;, who I've known for many years. She was updating me on how he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Controversy_and_resignation_from_MIT_and_Free_Software_Foundation&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; his position at &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/&quot;&gt;FSF&lt;/a&gt; in recent days. Of course I had been following the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I offered advice, in an email, which I am including below. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I feel for Stallman. On the other hand he had a long run and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Honors_and_awards&quot;&gt;celebrated&lt;/a&gt; in so many ways, given an office at MIT, had a foundation. Some of us would have loved that kind of support. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As his PR person I think you can help by first learning from others' mistakes in these situations. There have now been lots of them. A mistake a lot of people make is trying to fight back or argue with the judgement. I don't think that works. If he has the money, taking some time off, writing software perhaps, fixing bugs in other people's stuff. Not being such a big guy for a while. Live a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;human-size life&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine what he could come up with if he wasn't always out traveling and evangelizing? I've done it. I even write software just for myself these days, no intention to publish ever. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Best advice is to slow down, set your expectations on a longer horizon, and do some self-improvement. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One thing I would insist on from Warren -- if she wins -- is that she keep the people organized. The campaign does not stop if she's elected, actually that's when it kicks into super high gear. That was the mistake Obama made. We had a chance to install democracy everywhere.</description>

			<description>History will not be kind to Obama re Trump and Putin. He vastly underestimated both. And showed it, in both cases, publicly. Presidents can't do that.</description>

			<description>Dave Carlick, marketer, a friend for decades. He did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot; cogitank+ergo+sum&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cogitank Ergo Sum&lt;/a&gt; campaign for us, among others. He also pioneered what he called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=carlick+&quot; database+marketing&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;Database Marketing&lt;/a&gt;. It's what the whole tech industry is based on now. He went on to do Netscape's first website, then became a VC, and a board member lots of places, but we still hang out like we did in the early 80s. Anyway, Dave was one of the first to subscribe to my blog via &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;, and the other day he told me an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/15.html#a192924&quot;&gt;idea I posted&lt;/a&gt; was good. That meant the world to me. For years there has been almost zero feedback to this blog from real-world friends.</description>

			<description>Idea for a product. Customizable search engine with prefs. I'd like to have Wikipedia page come first in all searches for which there is a Wikipedia page. I think of Google and Wikipedia as if they were two branches of government. I use them to check up on the other. That's really how search has evolved for me in 2019.</description>

			<description>I just bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-5/&quot;&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;. I wear mine all the time. The reason I got the upgrade? Always-on screen. It's a pain when riding my bike and I want to see what's on the watch, I have to take both hands off the handlebars to get the watch to show me. So I don't do it. I'm getting $100 back for my previous Apple Watch, still in perfect shape.</description>

			<description>I used my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/apple-card/&quot;&gt;Apple credit card&lt;/a&gt; to buy the watch. Surprised they didn't streamline that, it shouldn't have required me to enter a number. They know who I am, my identity connects the store and the card. They didn't even acknowledge that I used their card. Apple, who has often set the bar really high for marketing awareness, missed an opportunity for an obvious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzQaEtMwBw8&quot;&gt;high five&lt;/a&gt;. They should also btw give you a discount for using their card, esp in early days.</description>

			<description>A corollary of your never knowing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/philo_103409&quot;&gt;struggles&lt;/a&gt; of other people. As the people you think about grow older, the chance they're dealing with serious health issues approaches certainty. So if you make work for them that might be one reason they don't do it. This is one of the most offensive things about what &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is doing to the web.

			<description>When I was a college student in New Orleans in the 1970s, I used to hang out at restaurants and bars on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Street_(New_Orleans)&quot;&gt;Oak St&lt;/a&gt; in Uptown. It's very close to the line separating the city and Jefferson Parish, and like most political lines in the area, it's marked by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee&quot;&gt;levee&lt;/a&gt;. If one side floods it doesn't necessarily mean that the other does. It was also very close to the Mississippi River, which of course also has a levee. In this case you walk up the levee, and the river comes to within a few feet of the top, way above the level of the city. If the levee were to break, a huge volume of river water would flood the city. I understood at an intellectual level how precarious this place was. But Oak St was an affluent street in a mostly affluent area. Living there you had the sense that it will always be this way. It seemed impervious to catastrophe. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html&quot;&gt;Thirty years later&lt;/a&gt;, after Katrina, I came back and Oak St was destroyed. A fire had raged through the area, unchallenged by fire fighters who were gone. The civilization that seemed so dependable had folded. The people had moved to other cities. New Orleans was almost empty. The point of the story is that climate change may seem theoretical because you live near an Oak St in whatever town you are in. But its stability, the foundation it's built on, is mostly in your imagination.</description>

When initializing a shared object, it ignored all non-scalar fields. I was using a daveutils routine copyScalars to do the copying. I wrote a new local routine that copies everything. I can't think of a reason it should only do scalars. It came up in an application I was writing. We're at that stage in this project where I try to use it as it was designed to be used and discover that the system guy (me) didn't correctly anticipate the needs of the app developer (also me).</description>

When initializing a shared object, it ignored all non-scalar fields. I was using a daveutils routine copyScalars to do the copying. I wrote a new local routine that copies everything. I can't think of a reason it should only do scalars. It came up in an application I was writing. We're at that stage in this project where I try to use it as it was designed to be used and discover that the system guy (me) didn't correctly anticipate the needs of the app developer (also me)." created="Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:00:52 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/09/16.html#a150052"/>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ruling_Class_(film)&quot;&gt;The Ruling Class&lt;/a&gt;, a comedy starring Peter O'Toole, was one of my favorite movies as a teen. The main character, a member of the British aristocracy, said he was God and spread a message of love for all. Some great jokes. It appears they have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijd8bregkt4&quot;&gt;whole movie&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube, for free.</description>

			<description>An &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1173300120206663680&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; and  other pubs with paywalls. Suppose I request a link to a story, you include a code in the url, so when you get a hit you know it came thru me. At least deduct that page from my monthly quota. Or maybe a twofer.</description>

			<description>It took hours of digging through various bits of software to figure out that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nbariver&quot;&gt;nbariver&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account had been suspended because they thought it was sharing personal information inappropriately. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/twitterComplaint.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the report. Obviously we were not sharing personal information, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/tweetInQuestion.png&quot;&gt;relaying&lt;/a&gt; a news report from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/13/michael-porter-jr-adam-silver-cell-phone/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dp-sports-nuggets+%28Denver+Post%3A+Sports%3A+Nuggets%29&quot;&gt;Denver Post&lt;/a&gt; that some sharing had taken place. This is interesting because a human obviously would be able to tell the difference, and also it's exactly what we were discussing on Twitter over the last few days, how to automate these things. I did not delete the tweet, it was completely innocent.</description>

			<title>A definitive list of news feeds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted an item &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/14.html#a164047&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1172912815054737408&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; suggesting a collection of RSS feeds from news orgs managed by one or more universities. There were a few responses from people who believe they at least have a good start on this, so let me flesh out the idea a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Think of it as a process more than a product. A list frozen in time isn't very useful. We have lots of those. The idea here is that the list is maintained, it grows and shrinks as new feeds are created, new organizations get on board, and of course some fall off. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think the people should come from a university or a group of universities. It could be a student project. Lots of people flow through the project over time, and go out into the world and help build awareness of the project. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Having a list that no one knows about is pointless. There should be marketing activity for the project, a Twitter feed, Facebook group, what else? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All popular feed formats are supported. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Feeds should be added conservatively. The quality of the feeds is very important. The list should be culled of dupilicates, different URLs for the same resource. Don't worry about including two feeds that include similar stories (for example, there is a sports feed for the NYT and also a New York news feed, stories about the Knicks would appear in both, this is not a problem, ).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Use the standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;OPML subscription list&lt;/a&gt; format as documented. Add attributes to any item with the metadata you have for it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open source all the way. MIT License for any software, and Creative Commons for the list itself. Create a GItHub repository to store the list and any associated documentation. It can be distributed in other ways of course, via a website, an internet-accessible database.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please post &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/131&quot;&gt;your comments here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
