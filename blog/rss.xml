			<description>Riding in a crowded elevator in Manhattan today. A woman was talking loudly and obscenely about how she hates where she works. She was so angry, entitled, arrogant. One of her office mates died last week, she said, and they didn't announce it. She said the owner was an asshole. As I was getting off, she described the owner as &quot;left wing,&quot; and then I got it. Next year he won't be left wing, he'll be a dirty Jew and she'll be wearing a swastika pin on her lapel. The nasty people are coming out of the closet. We're going to a bad place.</description>

			<description>I was going to a dentist for an emergency root canal. While I was lying helpless and in great emotional distress, I wondered why the Nazis don't come fully out of the closet. They must be scared we will kill them. My train of thought went to just how I would like to kill the Nazi woman on the elevator. It helped me deal with the emotional pain of being so helpless while I could hear my tooth being drilled and smelling the fumes coming out of my mouth, sort of a burning tooth BBQ. I have to say there is a reason I am willing to endure so much discomfort to avoid being in the dentist's chair. Why don't they just put you under, or load you up with opiates?</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/election-2016-voting-precinct-maps.html&quot;&gt;big NYT map&lt;/a&gt; today was interesting, even if it is a bit dated. I looked up all the places I've lived and they were all blue, except the street I grew up on in Queens. That was red. I thought about all my mom's neighbors and how they must have mostly been Trump voters. In a way I was glad she never found out. Some of the racist things I've heard them say now make sense. The neighborhood is turning, from white and Christian to Asian. I can't imagine they will vote for Trump, but wtf do I know.</description>

			<description>I was reviewing some &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;old podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, and came across one from 2007. I was talking about Google Toolbar and a conversation I had with Marissa Mayer. I didn't remember the controversy, but was able to piece it together from listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cnMar1B.mp3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2006/02/16.html#When:9:37:59AM&quot;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/02.html&quot;&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20050225052941/http://www.thetwowayweb.com/2005/02/22&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/02/22.html&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;. It was a really evil thing. They changed links in HTML pages in Firefox (this predates Chrome) to point to Google's sites. It came pre-installed in Firefox. This was Google eleven years ago. Obviously that attempt to hijack the web didn't work. But this time they're coming back with their own browser, and are doing it slowly. But I don't doubt for a minute the idea is to go all the way, to make the web as much Google's as Facebook's world is Facebook's (I know that sounds weird).</description>

			<description>Good morning HTTP fans. I still haven't gotten the new version of Chrome here so I don't have to look at their defacement of my blog and other sites, yet. I read in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/chrome-warns-of-not-secure-sites-to-cut-web-surveillance-tampering-faq/&quot;&gt;CNET story&lt;/a&gt; (warning self-playing video) earlier in the week that Firefox isn't labeling HTTP-standard sites as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Evil%20Incarnate&quot;&gt;evil incarnate&lt;/a&gt;. Is this true? Is it something they are perhaps willing to commit to? If so, I will probably switch to Firefox. I have some other ideas, like moving off the web and providing my blog in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; app, far away from Google's ability to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;push&lt;/a&gt; me around (hah, Electron is built on Chrome, I wonder how independent it really is). Anyway, If anyone knows what Firefox's plan is, please post a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/88&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Or any other browser that accepts the web as TBL defined it. Warning: I may have to delete the thread because posts like this tend to draw trolls. You know who you are. Restrain yourself! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>How journalism views Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1022118404411588610&quot;&gt;Chris Hayes&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Facebook is the equivalent of a massively profitable factory that just dumps all of its waste into the river and never has to pay for the cost to clean it up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nxthompson/status/1022120139146321923&quot;&gt;Nicholas Thompson&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I think it's more like a massively profitable company that builds a giant river that everyone both drinks from and pees into. And it doesn't know how to clean it up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1022134114848309249&quot;&gt;Me&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;That's not my experience as a FB user. I'd love to see a journalism outfit break out of the pack and take a contrary position, considering that FB has a tough problem and they're smart, and aren't doing a bad job of iterating to an answer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot I don't like about Facebook, and I've been very &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+facebook&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/10/13/whyFacebookSucks.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; it. But the criticism they're getting from the journalism world now is uniformly negative and not insightful and doesn't stimulate a useful discussion. It's mostly a woe-is-me look at how dumb they are (or corrupt or a horror show). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see journalism take a dispassionate and informed look at this, teach us something,  based on an understanding of the problem they're trying to solve. A perspective that a theater critic would have, or an art, movie, food or music critic. Some idea of how we got here. Think a few steps out into the future, add a sense of what's at stake, and what would happen if FB did what they believe they should obviously do (which would be imho about as successful as Trump's trade war). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who use Facebook seem to like it. The advertisers pay money to be there. If it were as bad as these guys say why would they do that? There's a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes&quot;&gt;sour grapes&lt;/a&gt; here, or the appearance of sour grapes. They have to watch out for that. And it begs the question if Facebook is so wrong, why have none of you ever tried to compete with them? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>How to cut down &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;trolling&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter -- give people control over who can reply to them. The more followers you have the more incentive there is to post something inflammatory as a reply. Muting is nice, but it only prevents them from replying to you. Long after you've stopped seeing their trollish droppings, they are still getting flow for their abuse with replies. On some posts, no replies, please. Or replies only visible to me, no one else. Or replies only from people I follow. Or, as Facebook does, let the originator of the post remove trollish comments.</description>

			<title>Hoisting and more hoisting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/22.html&quot;&gt;hoisting&lt;/a&gt; to work in my editing environment for Scripting News. I think I have it working now. If you're reading this, &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; is working. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let me just say this. Hoisting is hard. Especially if you're retrofitting it into an existing app. This is good practice for getting it working inside &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;, which after a short burn-in period is the next thing on my to-do list. Might take a few days to get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more hoisting loose-end tied down, hopefully. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Apparently tomorrow is the day Google will start flagging sites that use HTTP, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;standard web protocol&lt;/a&gt;, as &quot;not secure.&quot; Curious to see how people react. BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/chrome-warns-of-not-secure-sites-to-cut-web-surveillance-tampering-faq/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; has auto-playing video. It may be &quot;secure&quot; but it's also obnoxious. This blog and all my other sites use HTTP. I don't see that changing. I expect this will make writing for the web more of a chore. That's life I guess. I don't want Google to be able to mold the web to its needs. I never signed on to being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/13/142326.html&quot;&gt;Google developer&lt;/a&gt;, and never would. Basic rule: Google is a guest on the web, as we all are, and guests don't make the rules.</description>

			<description>For my friends in journalism -- eventually Facebook, Google and Twitter will have to push the far right off their services, per your &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1329967/facebooks-fight-against-bad-content-is-as-chaotic-as-ever/&quot;&gt;wishes&lt;/a&gt;. But that won't be the end of the tectonic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics&quot;&gt;plate shifts&lt;/a&gt; in news. The right will form their own services, where your product will be excluded, and will still apply pressure on the public companies to treat your work as suspect, and they will have to give them what they want. At that point you must have control of your own distribution.</description>

			<description>Trump's latest tweet is no joke. It's a huge escalation. He blew through all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON&quot;&gt;defcons&lt;/a&gt;. The issue isn't whether or not to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1021334339399843840&quot;&gt;ban him&lt;/a&gt; from Twitter rather, where does he go for a rush after this? I &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; this about Trump as a troll in 2016: &quot;Immunity to outrage builds up over time. What pissed people off six months ago will barely show up as a blip today.&quot; You can already see that this tweet isn't getting people riled up as it might have a few months ago. They understand how his trolling works. This is a serious problem for him. Without the ability to escalate through tweeting, he might have to resort to flyovers and actual attacks.</description>

			<description>So it's almost official, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedreamshake.com/2018/7/23/17602366/carmelo-anthony-to-reportedly-sign-for-veterans-minimum-with-the-houston-rockets&quot;&gt;Melo is going to the Rockets&lt;/a&gt; for the veteran's minimum. I predict they won't like it any more than OKC did, unless Melo is willing to lead the second unit. That might work. Otherwise there's one too many on the starting unit that needs the ball. It's great that Harden and Paul have worked it out. Melo is still going to be a catch-and-shoot three point shooting guy. Not many moves to the rim for him.</description>

It's great that Harden and Paul have worked it out. Melo is still going to be a catch-and-shoot three point shooting guy. Not many moves to the rim for him." created="Mon, 23 Jul 2018 14:16:14 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/07/23.html#a141614"/>

			<description>Libraries have a purpose Iâ€™ve never seen written up â€” as sanctuaries for children of troubled households. As a child, there was a safe place I could go at night, when things were crazy at home. A place they cared about kids, as people.</description>

			<description>When Repubs say they want to vote Democratic, the correct &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1021377132629512192&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; is to say hey great to have you on the team! Let's really make America great again. I was dismayed when people pissed all over &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Comey/status/1021132108381683712&quot;&gt;James Comey&lt;/a&gt; when he said (basically) he want Democrats to win in November. That's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; news. He found the right answer. The lights are coming on. People have so much trouble taking &lt;i&gt;yes&lt;/i&gt; for an answer.</description>

			<title>Librarians</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to say what I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/23.html#a124343&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; about libraries and librarians for many years, but as long as my parents were alive, I didn't want to write about it. I still don't want to write about it in any great detail, because I understand why it was like it was.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anger, pain and fear are passed down through generations. I knew their parents, and I knew what they all went through to get to America. I came to believe later in life that the responsibility of a parent is to do better than was done to them as a child, and both my parents achieved that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back in the 60s, when I was growing up, things were different. Now, I think a kid could walk into a police station and tell the story of his house, and there might be some help. But not then. People stayed out of the internal life of families. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The library really was a sanctuary for me. The librarians at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/queens-borough-public-library-auburndale-flushing&quot;&gt;Auburndale branch&lt;/a&gt; of the Queens Borough Public Library knew me, they knew what I was interested in, what books I liked, what stories I liked to hear, and tell. The most important thing was they treated me as a real person. For kids, even today, that's rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why librarians will always be special to me. Their ethos, their role, is so essential to a functional community. They don't get enough credit elsewhere, but with me, they are American heroes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been working on hoisting for the core outliner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. Just got it working today. Saving while stuff is hoisted was the hardest part. I don't seem to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+hoisting&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;hoisting&lt;/a&gt; defined on my blog, probably because the outliner in Frontier didn't have the feature. There are two operations, hoist and dehoist. Put the bar cursor on a headline. If you &lt;i&gt;hoist&lt;/i&gt; it, everything that's subordinate to the headline becomes your world. The other stuff is still there, but you can't see it or edit it. You can focus on just this part of the outline. I need it for my blog, when I'm working on a long post and want to quickly scroll to the beginning or end. &lt;i&gt;Dehoist&lt;/i&gt; as you might imagine undoes the last hoist.</description>

			<title>How to improve Twitter in 2018</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So Jack Dorsey is looking for ways to improve Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are three I can think of:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate the character limit, allow for linking, simple styles, titles and enclosures (for podcasting). The move to 280 chars was so successful, that should be a clue. Remove the barriers to expression and let the whole web in via linking. Handle length the way Facebook does with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;see more&lt;/a&gt; link. It's good prior art. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Help news orgs create collections of news feeds for people to follow on Twitter and on the open web. I think ultimately that's what news orgs will become. Experts on where to find the people who are saying newsworthy stuff. It's not much of an evolution, it's what they've been doing for as long as I can remember. The web gives us the ability to create new structures for that. Since Twitter is a place people go for news, it's a natural evolution for Twitter. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/13/175214.html&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for how to do this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Make a commitment to developers and make it irreversible. What exactly this means is subject to negotiation. But no one company can do what a medium does. As great a company as Twitter might be, its not something companies were meant to do, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: A new rule. For every original tweet you write you have to RT someone else's.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It takes courage to write a &lt;a href=&quot;https://werd.io/2018/life-on-the-darkest-timeline&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; like this from Ben WerdmÃ¼ller. Whenever we write, imho, we're saying something simple. This is what I see. These are my values. This is what it's like to be me. By showing yourself, you become vulnerable, and that has a cost. Better to be safe. But sometimes you have so much to say, the pain is so great, it has to come out. One thing I've discovered in a life of ups and downs -- it's true -- it's darkest just before dawn. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Whenever we write, imho, we're saying something simple. This is what I see. These are my values. This is what it's like to be me. By showing yourself, you become vulnerable, and that has a cost. Better to be safe. But sometimes you have so much to say, the pain is so great, it has to come out.

			<title>What Russia has on Trump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/what-putin-has-on-trump&quot;&gt;Julia Ioffe&lt;/a&gt; got it right. This is what Putin has over Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At any time they could leak to news orgs proof that without Russian hacking of the 2016 election Trump would have lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anything else is BS, pee tapes, etc. No one, especially Trump, would care.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Being a conservative in 2018</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm a conservative. Something former-Republican conservatives can probably relate to. I think the vast majority of Americans who are freaked out about the Trump presidency could legitimately be described as conservative. However I've been voting solid Democratic since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For me, a bridge too far was the Iraq war. By 2004 we knew there were no WMDs, that the government had lied to us. This was huge. On such a serious matter as war or peace, you can't do what they did and keep the support of good Americans. At the moment they're talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2017/07/19/dont-want-smoking-gun-mushroom-cloud/&quot;&gt;mushroom clouds&lt;/a&gt; you need to suck it up and trust the government has seen something unthinkable that you can't see. Not lying out of their ass, as the Bushies were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the realization that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/21/colinPowelUn.png&quot;&gt;this moment&lt;/a&gt; was based on a lie, that meant I would never vote Republican again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I firmly believe in Choice, am in favor of radical gun control, I have a serious pre-existing condition, so I get how important health insurance is. But you could actually vote Republican before 2000 and still have these positions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And voting Democratic is no panacea.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the United States is what it is. No generation gets to radically change direction. I say that as a baby boomer who marched for peace in the 60s and 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the lesson of America.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Change is continuous. A country that still hasn't shaken off the legacy of slavery isn't going to transform into a European socialist country in a generation. Not after what we've been through in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We made a lot of changes in the last ten years. And our chain has been yanked back. Hopefully that's all it is. But it's a mistake to try to yank it again. It's time to compromise. We need to elect a president we'd all like to have a cup of coffee with. Not someone who wags his finger and talks over us. Who doesn't listen. Who is as much a narcissist as the current asshole in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My slogan, if you've made it this far is this -- Make Politics Boring Again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I felt, once Obama was elected, that that was as good as it was going to get. We are the United States. That means we're fucked up. But at least let's think a bit before we start pushing people around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Toby Ziegler nails it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4vU1ygmq-s&quot;&gt;this scene&lt;/a&gt; in The West Wing. &quot;They'll like us when we win.&quot; This could be the motto of America right up there with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum&quot;&gt;E Pluribus Unum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I think IFTTT supports rssCloud</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is why I think that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I post an item to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt;, it also goes to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; app that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/applets/15217689d-if-new-feed-item-from-http-radio3-io-users-davewiner-rss-xml-then-post-a-tweet-to-bullmancuso&quot;&gt;watches&lt;/a&gt; that feed, and when something new shows up posts it to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bullmancuso&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also ping the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/opmlHowto/dave/rssCloud/walkthrough.html&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; notifier, the one that's pointed to from the &amp;lt;cloud&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/21/cloudElement.png&quot;&gt;element&lt;/a&gt; in the feed. It tells an app how to be notified immediately of an update.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing. The Twitter feed gets the update immediately now. Sometime in the last year (?) or so it started being instantaneous. Unless they're polling the feed ridiculously often, they must be hooked in through the &amp;lt;cloud&gt; element. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they did, I think this is very cool. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I doubt if anyone is really like but I am not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am neither left or right. I think for myself. I try to understand each issue and form my own position.

They've made it very clear that to the extent they have such things, they will have no influence on what they do. This piece is required reading, imho. And the business-as-usual approach of Bernie Sanders et al is unsupportable. &lt;i&gt;We need to close ranks.&lt;/i&gt; Stop trying to optimize and just focus on getting the Repubs out of our government, asap.</description>

They've made it very clear that to the extent they have such things, they will have no influence on what they do. This piece is required reading, imho. And the business-as-usual approach of Bernie Sanders et al is unsupportable. &lt;i&gt;We need to close ranks.&lt;/i&gt; Stop trying to optimize and just focus on getting the Repubs out of our government, asap." created="Fri, 20 Jul 2018 17:40:44 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/07/20.html#a174044"/>

			<title>Why Facebook doesn't ban liars</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, but it may be because I'm a neophyte in most of what they cover. When they cover Facebook, and other tech industry topics, they are the neophytes, and imho, they once again, imho, have missed the story in &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/07/20/570056.html&quot;&gt;today's podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The story is Facebook's attempts to regulate the virality of lies. They're not trying to eliminate the lies, because as Zuckerberg states, we all make mistakes, and if they banned people or organizations that told lies, they'd be banning a lot of valuable interactions and people. Instead, when a story starts going viral, and if it's a lie, they tell the algorithm to ignore its popularity. To me, someone with some experience managing online communties, though not at the scale of Facebook, that seems to be a clever and wise solution. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Times reporter wants them to do more. He says Zuckerberg will have to use his power. He has no obligation to be fair, applying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; of a western democracy to speech on Facebook. He could do what the NYT would like him to do, ban Infowars, Breitbart and Gateway Pundit, and keep the NYT and Washington Post. But this isn't what Facebook wants.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if Facebook banned Infowars and Breitbart and other lie-spreading make-believe news orgs? They'd start their own Facebook. You might think it's not possible, but Facebook knows how many followers they have, and how hard the technology is. &quot;Facebook is a business,&quot; Zuck said. And as a business he has to think about growth, and defending against potential competition.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last thing he wants is to give the right-wing infowarriors an excuse to move their users off Facebook and onto a right-wing-approved social network. I am sure that's coming, btw. I'm sure he's sure as well. And he wants to put that out as far in the future as he can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Any senator could stop this</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If a Republican senator wanted to do something brave to call a timeout on the Trump presidency until some basic questions were answered, all they would have to do is this...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Announce that they were voting against &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2018/07/17/kavanaugh-has-least-support-of-any-supreme-court-pick-in-three-decades/&quot;&gt;Kavanaugh&lt;/a&gt; and make sure everyone understood this is why. Then a few other Republican senators can join in, and then we'd have a bi-partisan discussion of the very minimum loyalty we insist on from a POTUS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Congress can act as representatives of the people. Never mind what they say to pollsters' questions. Imagine they knew how disloyal the president is. Act as a way of preventing the First Amendment being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_is_not_a_suicide_pact&quot;&gt;suicide pact&lt;/a&gt;. Which is what's actually happening. Fox News has taken control of the political process, more than Trump, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: Andrew Sullivan &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/amp/2018/07/andrew-sullivan-why-trump-has-such-a-soft-spot-for-russia.html?__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, persuasively, why this won't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
