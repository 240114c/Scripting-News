			<description>People who focus on Trump waste focus. He's even more dangerous to himself than he is to us. He's the kind of person that the virus gets first. His age and physical condition make him vulnerable, and he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/coronavirus-trump-handshake-touch&quot;&gt;isn't protecting&lt;/a&gt; himself.</description>

			<description>I had to drive to the car dealer today to pick up my car. Along the way, I had many opportunities to pick up the virus. First was when I crossed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston%E2%80%93Rhinecliff_Bridge&quot;&gt;Rhinecliff Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and had to stop to pay a toll. The toll booth operator had gloves on. I gave her six quarters and before continuing, I wiped the hand that touched hers. Her glove was accumulating all the viruses on everyone's hands who paid the toll. At the dealer, I had to sign a form to get my car back. They gave me a pen to use. I had no idea who else had used the pen. They did have hand sanitizer on the desk. I used it. Also thought about stealing it, but didn't. When I got my car, I rubbed down the steering wheel with sanitizer. Forgot to wipe the gear shift or the controls for the heating system, until after I touched them. On the way back I got a car wash. Paid the attendant $12 in cash, and he gave me change, again in cash. I thought about all the people who had touched the bills, including the attendant.</description>

			<description>I had anxiety about Covid19 for the first time this morning. This could be it. But if it isn't, I have some great software in mind. Funny how being this scared brings out the creativity. On the other hand if this is the time to go -- I'd rather have it be in a plot of a terrible science fiction novel than say going in my sleep. The drama of Trump's speech last night. At one point I thought he was losing it and was going to start talking like Jerry Lewis in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/neEe1itDC_k?t=320&quot;&gt;Nutty Professor&lt;/a&gt;. I think that would have been good for everyone, but he got himself back on track. His eyes are dead. No one home.</description>

			<description>Instead of listening to podcasts about the virus I started listening to a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Break-Shot-First-Years-Memoir/dp/B081D93GP6&quot;&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; today -- James Taylor's memoir. The audiobook is the way to go because he plays his guitar while he's narrating. Many of his famous songs are all autobiographical. And his story is surprising. I didn't know anything about him. (Hold on. It's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/02/09/803843220/james-taylor-narrates-life-before-fame-and-sings-american-standards-on-new-album&quot;&gt;audio memoir&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>BTW, you can read this blog without using Twitter. I try to make sure of that. But imho it is way better if you do use Twitter. I see this as expediant. I could clone Twitter, and wait for everyone to use it, and I might end up waiting forever. And I don't have that much time. Or I could just use Twitter. It's like driving my car with Exxon gas. I'm sure some of the gas I put in the car actually comes from a hated company. But what the fuck. I can't fight every battle.</description>

			<title>Why Hillary Clinton isn't president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Four years later, after watching the 2020 campaign, I think I finally understand why we didn't have a woman president the last four years. No surprise -- of course it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; because of our attitude toward gender, and the way it forms women's public personalities. I don't know how it gets better, but first imho you have to understand the problem. Here's the story from my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, so I noticed things from a woman's point of view that I normally wouldn't. In debates, Bernie Sanders yelled over her or waved his hands in her face. She couldn't respond in kind. I wanted the moderators to put a stop to it. She couldn't respond in kind because who would tolerate a woman who behaved like that. Exactly why we shouldn't tolerate a man behaving like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I hear people say they hate Hillary Clinton, I remember when I hated her too. I remember exactly the moment that changed. Listening to an incredibly smart and well-spoken women being interviewed on NPR and stopping the car and waiting to find out who it was. Hillary Clinton. This was in the 90s when she was First Lady. Ever since I've challenged my assumptions on why I hate a public figure. I think about it, and decide whether that's correct. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The source of the hate was resentment. Who was she to have such a public voice. The bug was that of course she had earned a public voice. As wife of the president, she wasn't as she said the kind of woman who stays home and bakes cookies. She was very much part of the presidency. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, Hillary Clinton eventually became a Senator then a Secretary and then a candidate for president. Of course I supported her. Over the years I had come to appreciate her intelligence, hard work, thoughtfulness, all the qualities you want in a president. But one. She often lacked confidence. She was incredible of course, I could not do what she did, that's not the point. You can feel confidence in another person, and hers was fragile, a surface-level thing, it's where the sense she wasn't &quot;authentic&quot; came from. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When she was finally coasting to victory, the wind at her back, you could feel it, she could feel it, all of a sudden it comes crashing down, with another &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/&quot;&gt;bogus attack&lt;/a&gt;, the kind she had been suffering her whole life, the process that knocked her confidence down so thoroughly. She collapsed. You could see it in every speech, every interview. She was doing a great job of trying to hide it, but it couldn't be hidden. She was defeated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;HRC had been going through this all her life. It scarred her. She tried to do something that in her time proved to be impossible. There's no shame in that, but that is imho why she isn't president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;1. An instant transformation of the economics of health care in the US. Single payer for everything, for everyone, now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2. The US govt pays for sick leave for all sick employees who don't have sick leave from their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think trillions, not billions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We started out with two cases of Covid19, and after 20 weeks, assuming a doubling of cases every week, we're at over a million. And I'm sure you can go on from there. It isn't very long until everyone on the planet has had the disease. No one is immune.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It kills a fair number of those people, even if they are hospitalized. But at some point, say the 15th week, we will have completely used up all the hospital beds, and then the death rate will go way up. Maybe you don't get killed, but some large portion of your friends and family do. Even if you survive, you may wish you hadn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're venturing into the unknown. Life is always like that, but at most times we can hide it from ourselves, we go on with our usual routine. Most days are pretty ordinary. We have a hard time understanding that sometimes the comfortable daily humdrum can break. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina&quot;&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans, I went there, to see what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html#newOrleansCoffeeNotes&quot;&gt;post-apocalyptic American experience&lt;/a&gt; was like. I knew the city well because I had gone to college there. What I saw was a city that would never recover from what happened. It would continue, that was obvious, but it would never again be the city I knew. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are smart things we can do, and unfortunately in the United States, we aren't doing them. Of course. We're too stupid to think these things through. Our government sees this as an opportunity to shovel more money to themselves and their cronies. No thought is put into easing the strain on the health care system. On making it easy for every sick person to get the care they need, hospitalization, or the ability to stay home when sick so they don't infect others. To increase the survival rate, and slow the spread. We still haven't gotten the message that we all lose when people among us who are sick go untreated, especially when with a viral infectious disease for which no one is immune. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The smart thing to do right now would be to quickly replace our government with one that is immersed in the math and logic of virality. To get Sanders off the campaign trail and in Washington to plead the case for single payer health care now, for everyone. He, unlike most Congress people, has the attention of the press. We need to close down every opportunity for the virus to infect masses of people, and treat and isolate those who do get infected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The mayor of New York, supposedly a smart person, has yet to cancel the St Patrick's Day parade. No doubt it &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be canceled, but the idea that at this late date it hasn't, tells you someone in authority who is not insane (unlike our president) hasn't figured out how this works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're now paying the price for the dumbing-down of our country. As one of the more vulnerable people (not the most, but close) I am sad that my fate is in the hands of such incompetence. I'm doing what I can to spread the information that we're wasting the gift of time we were given, we can learn from the experience of Italy, Iran and China. But of course, we aren't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Think about it this way. What if you got a 2-week advance notice that something really shitty was about to happen, and you actually know a lot about what will happen. I listened to a podcast with an expert on this stuff, and he said we got lucky this time. Imagine that. We got lucky, weird, but yes we did.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our friends in Italy are telling us we should learn from their experience and use the couple of weeks extra time we have to prepare. They appear to be doing this in Washington state. But not so much here in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Those who survive the virus will have to live in its aftermath. The economy is going to stop like the economy in New Orleans did after Katrina. One of the big lessons of Katrina was that once stopped, it takes a long time for an economy to reboot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not blaming gov Cuomo. People have to be mobilized.  They're mobilized in Wash because they have the biggest outbreak in the US so far. And we are soft in the west, we can't imagine things being not-normal.   People in New Orleans however I'm sure are aware of the hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must play hold music make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc&quot;&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When last night's email went out, it sent Saturday's posts, not Sunday's. This is pretty hard to debug, I'd have to recreate the conditions of various databases at midnight last night. At first I thought the problem must be related to the Daylight Savings Time switch on Saturday night, but on second thought, how could it? It doesn't really seem likely. And the relevant machines auto-updated their clocks. So for now, I'm going to wait to see what happens tonight. If the right stuff goes out, then I'll just call it an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case&quot;&gt;edge case&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray&quot;&gt;cosmic rays&lt;/a&gt; (programmerese for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_God&quot;&gt;Act of God&lt;/a&gt;) and move on.</description>

			<description>Back in the world of the mundane, recall that I've had a problem with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html&quot;&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27/191010.html&quot;&gt;deliveries&lt;/a&gt; for a while, so I was amazed today when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/09/upsTruck.png&quot;&gt;UPS truck showed up&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, it was just a temp driver, subbing for the permanent one. One day we will get this worked out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ¤·&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="Back in the world of the mundane, recall that I've had a problem with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html&quot;&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27/191010.html&quot;&gt;deliveries&lt;/a&gt; for a while, so I was amazed today when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/09/upsTruck.png&quot;&gt;UPS truck showed up&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, it was just a temp driver, subbing for the permanent one. One day we will get this worked out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ¤·&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:01:11 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/09.html#a200111"/>

It's pathetic. It shows that no one in our government has a clue about the scale of the problem. We need enough money to radically change the economics of health care in the US in an instant, the way the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-china-managed-build-entirely-new-hospital-in-10-days-2020-2&quot;&gt;Chinese built&lt;/a&gt; new hospitals for Covid-19 patients. We, uniquely in the world, have the ability, at least for now, to make that much capital come into existence. We don't need to take out loans or increase the deficit. We need the money to provide for the sick, at home or in hospital, and to keep the supply chains open even if people aren't working and therefore can't afford what the supply chain is producing. We have to think clearly.</description>
