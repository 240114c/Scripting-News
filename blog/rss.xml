			<description>Trump pretended he didn't know what the KKK is when David Duke endorsed him. He led cheers of &quot;Lock her up&quot; referring to Hillary Clinton. He praised Nazis who marched in Charlottesville and ran down a crowd, killing a woman. And so much more. This is a depraved narcissistic madman. A very dangerous person. So you're surprised he dissed Dr Ford? It was 100% predictable.</description>

			<description>I had a thought, I wonder if it's true, that most tech begins open, as a skunkworks project by a geek or two. If it catches on, inevitably someone tries to commercialize it. Often they are successful and the open version languishes. We should pay attention &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it's commercialized, and understand the freedom that comes from its openness. This came up in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/01/141620.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote on Monday. Let's appreciate the Joni Mitchell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUo9C1vUt0A&quot;&gt;view&lt;/a&gt; of things: there's something inherently good and sweet about the &quot;one-man band by the quick lunch stand.&quot;</description>

			<title>Font Awesome and Medium-Editor</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've become email friends with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davegandy&quot;&gt;Dave Gandy&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. I can't sing the praises of that product high enough. It's a life saver, if it didn't exist, I'd still be stealing graphics and they'd suck as icons. FA takes care of an important part of the UI of the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second disclaimer, I juggle so many external technologies I don't have the bandwidth to dive into any of them too deeply, so when I think I uncover a problem, very often it's just a lack of info, a misunderstanding, or due to the fact that I exist in a perpetual state of developer fog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OK with those disclaimers, here's the narrative:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;Medium-Editor&lt;/a&gt; in some of my projects. It uses Font Awesome for parts of its UI. I also use Font Awesome in all my projects. I recently upgraded to version 5.2.0. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I notice that the tool bar in my Medium Editor instance has breakage. The big H for H2 and H4 are missing their H's which are Font Awesome objects. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icon/header/&quot;&gt;fa-header&lt;/a&gt; specifically. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/03/mediumEditorToolbar.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; showing what the toolbar looks like when it's working properly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On investigation it appears it is missing in 5.2.0. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/icons/heading&quot;&gt;fa-heading&lt;/a&gt; object looks very much like the original fa-header. Is it possible they changed its name?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I look to see what version of Font Awesome the Medium-Editor &lt;a href=&quot;http://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; uses. It's 4.4.0. So I try including that version in my app and &lt;i&gt;the H's come back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So my conclusion is there is breakage between Medium-Editor and Font Awesome. I am downgrading this app to use the old version of FA. However, there was a reason I upgraded, so my software is in a weird state of disrepair as a result of this workaround.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they did indeed change from fa-header to fa-heading, my request is DON'T DO THAT.  The world has built on your icons. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics&quot;&gt;aesthetics&lt;/a&gt; at this point do not matter. If you think the icons are misnamed, you are wrong. Please refer to the disclaimers at the top of this post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Re Democrats ruining Kavanaugh's life -- The legal system ruins lots of lives. Kavanaugh isn't special. I'm sure he's ruined a few lives himself. We should have more sympathy and grace for the Supreme Court. Putting a openly partisan hack on the court means no one will respect its decisions in the future. Not presidents, not the military, not you and I.</description>

			<description>I'm now about as good in JavaScript as I was in C or Frontier. I make the same number of mistakes in my code in JS as in the other environments, but in Frontier, I cruised through most of the fixes in a fraction of the time it takes in JS. Debugging was much faster, the data was right there in a browsable, live-editable structure. I couldn't make a statement about that before because I wasn't as proficient in JS.</description>

			<description>I listened to today's &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/archive/2018/10/01/254049.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Very good. Not listening to victims of abuse is an American tradition. As I've said in two recent pieces, abuse is the context of our civilization. It's everywhere. In homes and schools, offices, Congress, and you can be sure this isn't the first time a Supreme Court nominee has been a rapist (assuming he did it, which I do). We all have to learn how to listen. But getting some to listen is a start.</description>

But getting some to listen is a start." created="Mon, 01 Oct 2018 20:55:23 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/01.html#a205523"/>

			<description>One of the things that makes GitHub a good candidate for an object database for a CMS is that it can store all kinds of data, including code. In fact, it's original design is for storing code, all the other data types were extra.</description>

			<description>It would be interesting if an actor who looked something like Kavanaugh, recorded a 5-minute play where he said the exact word-for-word same things Kavanaugh said in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORdRbReYOv0&quot;&gt;opening statement&lt;/a&gt; but substituted Dems with Repubs, Clintons with Kochs, left with right, and go ahead and make him black. Make videos of Republican focus groups watching it.</description>

			<title>My two cents on Inrupt</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people have asked what I think of Tim Berners-Leeâ€™s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90243936/exclusive-tim-berners-lee-tells-us-his-radical-new-plan-to-upend-the-world-wide-web&quot;&gt;new project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s a worthwhile goal.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Its success depends on getting other devs to sign on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inrupt.com/&quot;&gt;Startups&lt;/a&gt; are hard.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are other approaches, going back to the web itself. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Anna and Stallman</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Masera&quot;&gt;Anna Masera&lt;/a&gt; interviewing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annamasera/status/1046761759476985856&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. She asked the right question. I wonder if he knows that he has to sell people on his vision. But it's amazing to see all those young minds show up where ever he does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience when I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupschool.org/&quot;&gt;Startup School&lt;/a&gt; in Palo Alto a few years ago. They had all these rich successful entrepreneurs on stage saying how they did it, but during the breaks I was always surrounded by young folk who wanted to know about open technology.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should have a better pitch for the kids, not all-or-nothing like Stallman, and not total rape-and-pillage like the VCs, rather here's how you can help make things better, improve chances for freedom. Because that's how imho you solve the conundrum Anna pointed out. Who goes first, business or education? Well the answer is when you have something open, use it and understand the value in it and protect it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So many people who are involved in podcasting for example don't understand how the fact that it's open means they have opportunities. Later when Amazon or Apple or Google take control, they'll wonder how to make it open. That won't work, but keep it open? That can work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also, from 2011: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/31/whyIStandUpForStallman.html&quot;&gt;Why I stand up for Stallman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
