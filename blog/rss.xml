			<description>Yesterday I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/23.html#a150837&quot;&gt;briefly&lt;/a&gt; about new social graphs. Here's the background. For a long time, years, to get engagement with smart people on my writing, I had to cross-post to Twitter or Facebook, and at times Medium. This never worked well, there were limits to their APIs or format (character limits on Twitter, for example). Following the Cambridge Analytica mess, Facebook shut down their API so cross-posting was no longer possible. But now, I’m getting engagement, like I did in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;early years&lt;/a&gt;, on my blog, &lt;i&gt;without going through a silo. &lt;/i&gt;This conversation, the one we’re having right now, is part of a new social graph. Nothing long-term about it, it’s already here. Now the question is what's the next step. The email connection works. (To people who are only following in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, I recommend trying the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. It feels different. For example, if you reply, I will see it. That doesn't happen in RSS.)</description>

			<description>After learning about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/22.html#a181713&quot;&gt;Yacht Rock&lt;/a&gt;, I've been listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doobie_Brothers&quot;&gt;Doobie Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, reading up on their history. This morning I was listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJe1iUuAW4M&quot;&gt;What a Fool Believes&lt;/a&gt;, following along in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=what+a+fool+believes+lyrics&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=what+a+fool+belie&amp;aqs=chrome.1.0l2j69i57j0l3.7618j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt;, and saw that it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/24/arethaWroteTheSong.png&quot;&gt;written by&lt;/a&gt; Aretha Franklin! I couldn't imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNIXiqJrhfw&quot;&gt;how she would sing&lt;/a&gt; the song. BTW, I've been &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; that kind of fool.</description>

			<description>How permalinks work on Scripting News. There's a simple feature in my blog that makes it easy to point to a specific item. If you look at the end of any post you'll &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/24/purplePoundSign.png&quot;&gt;see four icons&lt;/a&gt;. The first, a &quot;purple pound sign,&quot; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/23/designChallengeParagraphlevelPermalinks.html&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; link to the item. When you click it, the browser opens the page, with that post at the top. That's the best link to send to friends.</description>

			<description>The human species has been on a drive to growth from the beginning. The way to survive was to have lots of kids to insure that some would survive to reproduce, thereby continuing our own DNA and insuring the survival of the species. Until the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic&quot;&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt; and mass production of fossil fuel, and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System&quot;&gt;forms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport&quot;&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt;, we were in balance with nature. But some time in the last hundred years the balance flipped, growth skyrocketed, and processes were set in motion that got us to today's climate crisis. Problem is that we, as a species, haven't evolved, our evolution-driven goals haven't changed, we still think having more children is a virtue, and that it's our right, even obligation, to consume more. Reversing that is not a simple matter (that's generous, in my heart I don't think it's even possible), and the problem was not created by one or two generations, as some of the young folk believe. The problem is with the nature of our species, the traits that evolution reinforced are the ones that are leading us off the climate cliff. So when I listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg&quot;&gt;Greta's&lt;/a&gt; speech, she isn't speaking just for her generation, she's speaking for mine too, and for my parents, who are gone. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://eve.scripting.com/2006/11/01&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;, who died in 2018, was passionate about consuming less. Greta would have liked her, I think. Yes we knew we were going off a cliff, even people who say they aren't sure, they knew too. But turning the ship around isn't something you decide to do. We each can do it ourselves, but that won't make a difference. I don't have the answers, but I know for certain that blaming today's adults for the future that today's children face is wrong.  Making other people the symbol of our grief for our species is typically human, and pointless.</description>

			<description>We froze our social graph too soon, imho.

			<description>Pelosi's choice: 1. Get behind impeachment, now, fully, no conditions. 2. Step aside and let the new Speaker do it. (Update: There's a third choice -- Delegate all matters related to impeachment to a special prosecutor, a member of the House. I think Adam Schiff would be ideal. Pelosi can handle everything but impeachment. Refer all questions to the prosecutor.)</description>

			<description>Finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AriMelber/status/1176138536078196737&quot;&gt;MSNBC gets&lt;/a&gt; to the real question. How the hell are we going to vote Trump out. We've only seen 1/10th (maybe) of one whistleblower leak. He must be making the &lt;s&gt;offer&lt;/s&gt; demand he made to the Ukranian president to every despot in the world.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; thing has been a big eye-opener. Real engagement has returned. On the web, not in a silo. I can't believe we found a way to crack the nut. Now I want to open up engagement in new ways. I have the benefit of all the paths we went down &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;starting in 1994&lt;/a&gt;. And I have lots of developed software running in JavaScript here that can be applied to new experiments. Exciting times.</description>

			<description>As usual journalism is cutting Trump too much slack. Here's what actually happened, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22occam%27s+news%22+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt;, between Trump and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelensky&quot;&gt;Volodymyr Zelensky&lt;/a&gt;, president of Ukraine. First, Trump doesn't care if there's an actual investigation. He wants Zelensky to say there was, and Biden &amp; Biden are being charged with something heinous that carries the death penalty in Ukraine. That's the first round of hype. Then Ukraine files for extradition of the Bidens. Trump goes through a whole drama, trying to decide whether or not to allow Biden &amp; Biden to be deported to Ukraine, or try them in the US, for interfering with an election in a foreign country, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act&quot;&gt;usurping&lt;/a&gt; the perogative of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump&quot;&gt;US govt&lt;/a&gt;. The press reports on &lt;i&gt;Trump's Decision, &lt;/i&gt;Day 1, Day 2 and so on. Reporters camp out in front of the White House all night waiting for a decision. Finally Trump emerges with AG Barr, he decides try them here, showing surprising mercy for the Bidens, it is reported almost everywhere. After all that Ukraine quietly receives the $250 million, of course with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)&quot;&gt;taste&lt;/a&gt; for Trump. My guess is that all this will still happen even though it's been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/us/politics/trump-ukraine-biden.html&quot;&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt;. And Pelosi still will not allow impeachment.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhh.dk/&quot;&gt;DHH&lt;/a&gt; wants something like the Scripting News nightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; for people he follows on Twitter. It's doable, the Twitter API has what's needed, but I'm not sure most tweets would look good in email. Think of the hacks people use to tell stories on Twitter. It would be easier the other way around, to take essays and turn them into a series of Tweets. Of course I have an app for that -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://pork.io/&quot;&gt;Little Pork Chop&lt;/a&gt;. There's also &lt;a href=&quot;http://happyfriends.camp/&quot;&gt;Happy Friends&lt;/a&gt;, a web app I wrote in 2014. It still works, but I don't use it myself anymore. Not sure why.</description>

			<description>It would be great if we could make voting a party, a celebration, something to look forward to, not something you have to make time for. That would probably do more to improve the lives of all Americans than any other single thing. It's like the SuperBowl, the NBA Finals, Coachella or the Oscars, only better -- because we are the stars.</description>

			<description>I finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/undone&quot;&gt;Undone&lt;/a&gt; last night. Spoilers follow, so be warned. In the story, a teacher urges a student to be the sky (paraphrasing), observe your feelings the way the sky might observe the flow of a river. This is something I've learned, it comes with age and experience, self-knowledge. I think  you can learn it at a young age, if you're taught and you practice. Once you can observe your feelings, fully feel them, but not let them become you, that's when you come into your power. Some reviewers say the series is about mental illness, but that's only one theory of the show, and not the one we're left with, waiting for season 2. I'm probably going to watch it again, it's such rich story and so beautifully told.</description>

			<description>Scott Love, via email: &quot;I want to star or rate your best gems!&quot; I always listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22scott+love%22+outliner&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt;. He was hired as a product marketing manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-80s, but he was so much more. We went to dinner probably two or three nights a week, and mostly about where to go with our outliner products, and what the competition in the Valley was doing. I would try ideas out on Scott, give him limited background, to see where his mind would go. Very creative and hard-working mind. Scott reads this blog via the nightly email. It's a lot like the old days at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-chus-los-altos&quot;&gt;Chef Chu's&lt;/a&gt; in Los Altos. So Scott, there are features in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/21.html#a150505&quot;&gt;web version&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News that aren't in the email version, for security reasons. They also aren't in the RSS version. You can Like any item on the blog, but only in the web browser version. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="Scott Love, via email: &quot;I want to star or rate your best gems!&quot; I always listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22scott+love%22+outliner&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt;. He was hired as a product marketing manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-80s, but he was so much more. We went to dinner probably two or three nights a week, and mostly about where to go with our outliner products, and what the competition in the Valley was doing. I would try ideas out on Scott, give him limited background, to see where his mind would go. Very creative and hard-working mind. Scott reads this blog via the nightly email. It's a lot like the old days at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-chus-los-altos&quot;&gt;Chef Chu's&lt;/a&gt; in Los Altos. So Scott, there are features in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/21.html#a150505&quot;&gt;web version&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News that aren't in the email version, for security reasons. They also aren't in the RSS version. You can Like any item on the blog, but only in the web browser version. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 21 Sep 2019 15:05:05 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/13/patriots.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/09/21.html#a150505"/>

			<description>A feature I've been thinking about. When I mention someone who's a long-time personal friend, they might have a blue checkmark after their name like this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bullmancuso.com/&quot;&gt;Bull Mancuso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/21/blueCheckmark.png&quot;&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/opinion/republicans-democracy-play-dirty.html&quot;&gt;Fascinating op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT by two political science &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Democracies-Die-Steven-Levitsky/dp/1524762938&quot;&gt;authors&lt;/a&gt; about why the Repubs play dirty. They illustrate more generally that political parties play dirty when they realize they can't stay in power any other way. But -- consider this sentence -- &quot;The only way out of this situation is for the Republican Party to become more diverse.&quot; As a programmer, which teaches me to challenge my assumptions, it's a critical part of design and debugging, I see that it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the only way out. Political parties aren't like baseball teams. As long as there's baseball, your favorite team will continue, though they could move or change their name. For example, the Washington Nationals are the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals#Montreal_Expos&quot;&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt;. But the same must not be true of political parties. The Repubs had a good run, but they went down a path that didn't work. So they lose elections. What of it. There's no way the Democrats will rule the whole country unopposed for any amount of time -- a new party will form. In all likelihood two new parties will form. There aren't enough white Christians in the US to rule, and many of them, esp the young ones, see themselves as part of a diverse America. Eventually the Repubs will disappear, the question is how much damage will they do on their way out.</description>

			<description>BTW, the radical adjustments in the US political system are an obvious response to big changes in the Soviet Union in the 80s and 90s. People thought at the time there would be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_dividend&quot;&gt;peace dividend&lt;/a&gt;, and that it signalled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man&quot;&gt;end of history&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't believe it at the time, I saw both ideas as tempting fate, the same way you brag that your candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/18/news/paddypower-pays-hillary-clinton-bettors/index.html&quot;&gt;can't lose&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/podcasts/the-daily/elizabeth-warren-rally.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; today about what an Elizabeth Warren rally is like. I liked how people were asked to take a minute and introduce themselves to the people around them. Wouldn't it be great if everyone left with a task they would do to make the world better, right now, not after Warren gets elected. This is what we need, meaningful things each of us can do to make things better. We yearn to belong and to do good work.</description>

			<description>Some shows I binge in &quot;savor mode,&quot; they're so good and there isn't much to binge on, so I go slow, stop often and savor shows to watch later. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/undone&quot;&gt;Undone&lt;/a&gt; is one of those shows. Two 1/2 hour episodes left. It is of a genre, wild misunderstood-as-crazy super-powered young woman, as much a victim of her powers as master of them. Undone is something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/russian-doll/season-1&quot;&gt;Russian Doll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/killing-eve&quot;&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Communicating with Amazon</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my orders with Amazon are uneventful. The product arrives when it was supposed to and it works and that's that. But sometimes something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On July 26, I ordered an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WNEJCBE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;outdoor thermometer&lt;/a&gt;. Not expensive, $10. But it was broken when I opened the package, and I cut my finger, it bled.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went to the Order page and reported that it arrived broken. I just wanted to throw it out, not wanting to handle the broken glass, possibly injuring myself again, or someone who had to handle it at UPS or at Amazon. That was the right thing to do. The Amazon rep said OK, they would credit me for the thermometer. Honestly I was surprised it was that easy. I ordered another one (which arrived unbroken and I'm using it).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well, about a week ago, I got an email saying I needed to send the thermometer back or I'd be charged for it. There was no way to respond. I got another notice a few days later saying they had charged me for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay $10 isn't going to make a difference to me, but it would make even less of a difference to Amazon. And they agreed to the arrangement, and it was the right thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I thought I'd write it up &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/20/130334.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on my blog. Maybe someone in an executive role at Amazon will see it, and will change their system so it's easier for customers to talk to them, and make sure when they agree to something, they stick to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We could rebuild the same thing dozens of times, or make one really awesome version. I like that IE/Microsoft is using and improving Chromium, it also keeps Google honest.&quot;</description>

			<description>Thanks for reading my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;blog via email&lt;/a&gt;. I love the comments, esp since only I see them,  there's less grandstanding, pontificating, more hey here's a book you'd like, or I listened to that podcast too.</description>

			<description>My smoothie-making has evolved. In the evening I make orange juice from concentrate to drink, with ice, while watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#2&quot;&gt;Mets&lt;/a&gt;. I leave about 1/2 glass for the morning, when I throw in frozen fruit, a heaping tablespoon of yogurt and a bit of warm water, and zap it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBQ1AIG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;blender&lt;/a&gt;. Pour it into a big glass and sip it for an hour or so while I write in the morning. It's delicious, cold, tasty and nutritious. I feel very loved.</description>

			<title>Advice for Stallman</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman's&lt;/a&gt; PR person, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sylviapaull.com/&quot;&gt;Sylvia Paull&lt;/a&gt;, who I've known for many years. She was updating me on how he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Controversy_and_resignation_from_MIT_and_Free_Software_Foundation&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; his position at &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/&quot;&gt;FSF&lt;/a&gt; in recent days. Of course I had been following the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I offered advice, in an email, which I am including below. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I feel for Stallman. On the other hand he had a long run and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Honors_and_awards&quot;&gt;celebrated&lt;/a&gt; in so many ways, given an office at MIT, had a foundation. Some of us would have loved that kind of support. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As his PR person I think you can help by first learning from others' mistakes in these situations. There have now been lots of them. A mistake a lot of people make is trying to fight back or argue with the judgement. I don't think that works. If he has the money, taking some time off, writing software perhaps, fixing bugs in other people's stuff. Not being such a big guy for a while. Live a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;human-size life&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine what he could come up with if he wasn't always out traveling and evangelizing? I've done it. I even write software just for myself these days, no intention to publish ever. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Best advice is to slow down, set your expectations on a longer horizon, and do some self-improvement. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
