			<description>In the Supreme Court I love how they talk about the president's massive todo list. This president just eats, farts, watches tv, and throws his poop at the wall.</description>

			<description>There was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2020/05/10/heads_up_to_rss_reader_authors&quot;&gt;kerfuffle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; world yesterday when it appeared that Apple wanted aggregator developers to get written permission from sites whose feeds they include as defaults. It appears this was an error, or Apple changed their mind. Also, I love the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=kerfuffle&quot;&gt;kerfuffle&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kerfuffle&quot;&gt;not the first time&lt;/a&gt; I've used it, according to Google. I'm surprised.

Maybe it's because I'm a former entrepreneur that I see &lt;i&gt;tons&lt;/i&gt; of ways to do this.   Biden, for example, could give Fauci a pulpit. I've tried this idea out of people inside the Democratic Party, they say this just isn't done. And that's a reason not to do something? Bill Gates could do it. He's entrepreneurial. It doesn't have to be Fauci himself, any affable avuncular scientist who tells the truth. As Trump fades into oblivion we should fill the airwaves with facts. That's a good way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;. ðŸ˜‡</description>

			<title>&lt;i&gt;ALEXA!&lt;/i&gt;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I use my kitchen Alexa only to listen to WNYC. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Usually I say &lt;i&gt;Alexa WNYC&lt;/i&gt; and it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I have to say it slowly and loudly, being sure thereâ€™s no other sound. It takes 3 or more tries.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But when I say &lt;i&gt;Alexa stop&lt;/i&gt; it works every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wonder if any of the news orgs with a paywall have thought about doing what Netflix and Google TV (and perhaps others) do. They let you share your membership with &quot;family members,&quot; which really means anyone you want. It might be good marketing.</description>

			<description>Another idea: A special deal for bloggers. People can read the stories if they come from my blog. The NYT used to do this. I felt like we had risen above crass commercialism, and were focused on informing people. Here come the lectures on how I don't understand news!</description>

			<description>How about a twist on that. Any paying user gets to forward stories from the site a certain number of times? Not sure about that. It's always so irritating when a friend RTs a story from the WSJ. It just doesn't make sense for me to subscribe. I did at one time, so I know what they do. I just am not that active in business these days. But sometimes they get a great story. Maybe what we need are peering arrangements of some kind. You get 50 free articles from the WSJ with a NYT subscription, and vice versa. Maybe those two pubs don't do it. But maybe say Mother Jones and National Review. Kind of like William F. Buckley &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2016/10/3/13081784/best-of-enemies-gore-vidal-william-buckley-pbs&quot;&gt;debating&lt;/a&gt; Gore Vidal?</description>

			<title>The NYT (still) needs fresh air</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/28.html#a215257&quot;&gt;high hopes&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt;, former editor-in-chief of Buzzfeed News, was hired as the NYT's media columnist. I first became familiar with his work when Buzzfeed got a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier&quot;&gt;Steele dossier&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; it with the public, causing an uproar in the press that it had not been vetted and should not have been published. I listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/pages/12818.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with him and New Yorker editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Remnick&quot;&gt;David Remnick&lt;/a&gt;, and cheered in a post &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/28/errOnTheSideOfDisclosure.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His position: The readers are smart. If we tell them it hasn't been vetted, they will add the same grain of salt a good reporter will. The contents of the dossier concerns them, they have every right to see it, since it was influencing politics and journalism. Outrageously, the press and Washington insiders had copies of the dossier for a long time, and had not released it. Meanwhile dumps of Clinton's emails were appearing, unvetted, almost daily. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/28/errOnTheSideOfDisclosure.html&quot;&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt; Smith and Buzzfeed for siding with the people. I have found this trust of readers to be very rare in journalism. Most journalists hold readers in great contempt if they think of us at all. Smith's philosophy was in sync with the blogger's view. And I was glad to see it in a respected mainstream publication -- Buzzfeed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when Smith went to the Times, I looked forward to finally having some pushback on their editorial page, which never allows dissent from the orthodoxy of the most prestigious of news orgs. &lt;i&gt;We Know Best&lt;/i&gt; could be their motto. &lt;i&gt;We'll Tell You What To Think, &lt;/i&gt;might be the tagline. This has gotten us into huge trouble over the years, for example with the buildup to the Iraq War, where they carried Bush Administration lies, unopposed, never retracted or apologized-for. Then in the 2016 election the fabricated story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; was born in the pages of the NYT, constantly repeated and amplified. You could legitimately blame the horrors of the Trump Admninistration, which are still reaching new heights, on the Times. Again, no mea culpa, and more importantly, no pushback from the op-ed pages. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another subject where piety has had no dissent on the editorial page is the idea that the tech industry stole their business and therefore owes them money. This is often repeated, never rebutted and is completely corrupt. As Bob Bierman said so well in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobbierman/status/1259809847698227201&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; this morning, in rebuttal to Smith's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/200510/p72#a200510p72&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/business/media/big-tech-has-crushed-the-news-business-thats-about-to-change.html&quot;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Respectfully, nothing was stopping a newspaper from starting a simple classifieds site, a micro-blogging site or a community where people could talk to each other.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That is such a key point. I've been banging this drum since the inception of the web. Compete! Open the pages of your news product to the people. I called this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;Sources Go Direct&lt;/a&gt;. I had a specific proposal for the Times in 2002, let the contributors be vetted by NYT reporters. Put their blogs on a separate domain with a big disclaimer. But when sources post there, you have quotes for future NYT articles. And stars will rise, and more important, your inbred ideas will be challenged under your masthead, something the Times needs, and more important, something the world needs. Had the Times done this there might not have been a Facebook, or they might not have played such an important role in the distribution of news.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Times has become too powerful and too unopposed. And now they want to cement this victory by drawing money from the tech companies, or to be paid money from taxes. The answer has to be no. First try to compete, and then try again and again until you get it right. Tech still doesn't do news well. There's a new world still to be explored, try to create a great news product out of the net, jump in and stop pretending news works as it did before it went electronic. And get some fresh blood on the op-ed pages. Let's get some real criticism of the Times there, at least. We don't need royalty in the White House and we certainly don't need it in journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="His position: The readers are smart. If we tell them it hasn't been vetted, they will add the same grain of salt a good reporter will. The contents of the dossier concerns them, they have every right to see it, since it was influencing politics and journalism. Outrageously, the press and Washington insiders had copies of the dossier for a long time, and had not released it. Meanwhile dumps of Clinton's emails were appearing, unvetted, almost daily." created="Mon, 11 May 2020 13:27:16 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/11/131041.html?title=theNytStillNeedsFreshAir#a132716"/>
				<source:outline text="I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/28/errOnTheSideOfDisclosure.html&quot;&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt; Smith and Buzzfeed for siding with the people. I have found this trust of readers to be very rare in journalism. Most journalists hold readers in great contempt if they think of us at all. Smith's philosophy was in sync with the blogger's view. And I was glad to see it in a respected mainstream publication -- Buzzfeed." created="Mon, 11 May 2020 13:28:18 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/11/131041.html?title=theNytStillNeedsFreshAir#a132818"/>
				<source:outline text="So when Smith went to the Times, I looked forward to finally having some pushback on their editorial page, which never allows dissent from the orthodoxy of the most prestigious of news orgs. &lt;i&gt;We Know Best&lt;/i&gt; could be their motto. &lt;i&gt;We'll Tell You What To Think, &lt;/i&gt;might be the tagline. This has gotten us into huge trouble over the years, for example with the buildup to the Iraq War, where they carried Bush Administration lies, unopposed, never retracted or apologized-for. Then in the 2016 election the fabricated story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; was born in the pages of the NYT, constantly repeated and amplified. You could legitimately blame the horrors of the Trump Admninistration, which are still reaching new heights, on the Times. Again, no mea culpa, and more importantly, no pushback from the op-ed pages." created="Mon, 11 May 2020 13:14:00 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/11/131041.html?title=theNytStillNeedsFreshAir#a131400"/>

I called this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;Sources Go Direct&lt;/a&gt;. I had a specific proposal for the Times in 2002, let the contributors be vetted by NYT reporters. Put their blogs on a separate domain with a big disclaimer. But when sources post there, you have quotes for future NYT articles. And stars will rise, and more important, your inbred ideas will be challenged under your masthead, something the Times needs, and more important, something the world needs.

				<source:outline text="The Times has become too powerful and too unopposed. And now they want to cement this victory by drawing money from the tech companies, or to be paid money from taxes. The answer has to be no. First try to compete, and then try again and again until you get it right. Tech still doesn't do news well. There's a new world still to be explored, try to create a great news product out of the net, jump in and stop pretending news works as it did before it went electronic. And get some fresh blood on the op-ed pages. Let's get some real criticism of the Times there, at least. We don't need royalty in the White House and we certainly don't need it in journalism." created="Mon, 11 May 2020 13:20:32 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/11/131041.html?title=theNytStillNeedsFreshAir#a132032"/>

			<description>Just heard a report on NPR that began with a quote from Trump, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie&quot;&gt;big bold lie&lt;/a&gt;, and they just went on as if he had made a good point. This has to stop. It's not saving my life, quite the contrary, it's killing people, to let Trump get away with lying about the role of testing. He says we have the highest numbers because we do the most testing. Yeah. Not true. And they went on to say that governors don't know why they need so much testing. What? Hello. Yes, everyone who cares knows. We need to know where the freaking virus is and isn't. That's why we test. It's the same reason we launch weather satellites, so we know where and when it's going to snow. I keep repeating this, hopefully the idea will spread. News should be in the business of saving my life and yours. It's never been more possible and more vital. And it's a good business model. If they're not just relaxing entertainment, if they &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;, we'll make sure they get the money they need.

			<title>Mother's Day 2020</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My mother was a regular reader of this blog. Maybe she still reads it, where ever she is, whatever form she is in. I have women friends who read the blog, I think in a similar way to the way she read it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was a very smart person, lots of brain power, but also very wounded, and the wounds, which we shared in a way, made it hard for us to be close. Maybe toward the end of her life she opened up a bit, but she had a fear of men, given to her by her parents, and she passed that on to her children, in the weird way that parents give their agony to their children. But she read the blog. That was something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The author and his mother with the author's newborn brother.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I dream about her every night. They are not happy dreams, they are dreams of unresolved anger, disloyalty. But I also feel for her in ways I didn't when she was alive. I wish I had protected her, which is ridiculous because she was the mother and I was the child. But it's there nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish we could talk, but then I remember, we never accomplished anything with talk. Yet, she is the one who fed me, taught me, read to me, gave me her values, and ultimately was proud of me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was my mother and all that came with it. I hope she can read this and I hope she's happy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="She was a very smart person, lots of brain power, but also very wounded, and the wounds, which we shared in a way, made it hard for us to be close. Maybe toward the end of her life she opened up a bit, but she had a fear of men, given to her by her parents, and she passed that on to her children, in the weird way that parents give their agony to their children. But she read the blog. That was something." created="Sun, 10 May 2020 13:06:22 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/10/130518.html?title=mothersDay2020#a130622"/>

			<title>My mother's judgement</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Now that my parents have been gone for some considerable time, our differences come into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I felt that my life was dispensable, temporary, so I was ready to take risks that they didn't want me to take.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you took them at face value, they were sure I was going to fail and be dependent on them. That I would fail at what I was trying to do, and then be a failure at life. That could have been the outcome. I was certainly close a few times! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why I was willing to take such risks is something I don't know. I have theories about it but I'm too close to have a good idea. I am what I am, it never was in question that I would do risky things. I wanted to do big things from a very young age. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My parents on the other hand valued security above all else. They had steady jobs, savings accounts, were very careful with their money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Funny thing was that both my grandfathers were pretty sure I was doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though I overcame their objections, I don't think either of my parents ever forgot the judgement they formed years earlier, that I was a failure. On a personal level I still took big risks even if I had established myself from a productivity standpoint. (This was my mother's biggest value, that we be productive.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were depression era refugees in World War II. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a Boomer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think that explains a bunch of it, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they would be surprised to know that I actually did pick up most of their values re money. While I have been willing to roll the dice on new ideas I either thought had potential or I believed in for other reasons, otherwise I am quite conservative in the way I live, though it took me a while to arrive at that. Acquiring too much is a burden, living as lightly as you can is a good value. That was my mother's thing. I never have been very organized in record-keeping. In that I am original, both my parents were very good at that. Maybe that's my act of rebellion. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also people who think the story of Boomers is written, consider Covid-19. We're still here, it's part of our story too. For all the hardship my parents' generation survived, they never had to deal with a pandemic. I'd love to send them an email about that. My grandparents on the other hand were around for the 1918 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Soon it will be my turn, and yours</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;After I moved to the mountains in March 2019, I've only been to NYC once, to have dinner with a friend from Calif who was visiting. Long before Covid. I don't really identify with the city much anymore. It feels far away. But it isn't far away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was raised in Queens -- in Jackson Heights and northeast Flushing. I'm guessing people in Flushing are doing ok relative Covid, but Jackson Heights is burning. Lots of people I rode the subways with are sick, very sick, dying or dead. Like the victims of a tsunami in SE Asia or a hurricane in Puerto Rico. In some ways it feels far away, but it isn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It just hit me in a visceral way when I thought of what happens when I will have to wait in soup lines after the collapse of the food supply in two or three months (or weeks as things are going). By then the infection will be even more out of control than it is now. My next thought -- I live in farm country, it's incredibly rich and fertile and productive place, so I'll be ok, but then I realize that food will be going to feed NYC which is just two hours to the south. Or it'll be feeding the people in the Hamptons, Martha's Vineyard or the Trumps and their buddies. It'll disappear just like the PPE did, down the Mafia hole. Going to Russia and Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The press meanwhile is covering &lt;i&gt;past&lt;/i&gt; failures of Trump, how they blew it in January. But they're blowing it in May, and that's going to spread poverty and death to new parts of America outside NYC. Soon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The virus is in the White House. I bet it's in Congress too and maybe the Supreme Court. It's in DOD and DOJ and Homeland Security. Government houses people densely just like meat packing plants, prisons, nursing homes. Lots of vulnerable people taking big risks. They aren't any more immune than you and I are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why I say journalism's business model is &quot;Save my life.&quot; We need to get back on track, I don't care how we do it, now is already too late for 80K Americans. But soon it'll be your turn and my turn. &lt;i&gt;Soon. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A couple of nights ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+maddow&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Rachel Maddow&lt;/a&gt; told the story of a group of entrepreneurs in Salt Lake City who set up a free Covid-19 testing program. Yes, they had the arrogance that's common to tech entrepreneurs, I know it very well. But they were trying to do good. I don't often notice the sarcasm and superiority in Maddow's stories, but I did for this one. I kept waiting for her to say what evil they had done, but it never came. Some doctors commented that their arrogance was ugly, and their tests could suck, sure, but it colored everything I hear from Maddow in a new way, the way she &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=seething&quot;&gt;seethed&lt;/a&gt; when she talked about Facebook a couple of years ago, from ignorance. In that case I knew the facts. So why not just report the facts, without so much attitude, and let us make up our own minds. And then I wondered how much do I listen to her for the superiority versus getting any real information. Another way to see it is what if a Fox News person used the tone she used. Would you see it then. I actually shut her off in the middle of the show last night, I want to re-think whether she is a force for good, and should I be paying attention to her at all. I know I've been here before with her and the rest of MSNBC. There aren't a whole lot of choices.</description>

			<description>Maddow even saw as corrupt, with a raised brow, that the tech industry in Salt Lake City calls itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Slopes&quot;&gt;Silicon Slopes&lt;/a&gt;. It's dorky, and so what. NYC calls its tech industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Alley&quot;&gt;Silicon Alley&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>We don't know who will be affected by Covid-19 in the future. People assume most young people don't have symptoms, but we really have no idea. One thing we do know that it isn't binary. You don't necessarily just recover back to who you were before you got the disease. The symptoms linger. The damage in some cases is permanent. Chickenpox shows up again later in life as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054&quot;&gt;shingles&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Covid is a serious illness. People who play politics with it, and want to convince you it's not serious, don't have a clue, because even the most skilled and educated medical scientists don't know what lies ahead.</description>

			<title>My backups</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a storage unit in Berkeley with all kinds of random stuff in it. When I moved to the new house in the mountains, I had a lot of room, so I had the storage unit contents moved out here. There were a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/diskbackups1.png&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/diskbackups2.png&quot;&gt;cartons&lt;/a&gt; of backups from Living Videotext and UserLand in the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't have hardware to read any of them, but I'd love to back them up somewhere like the Computer History Museum, or Stanford or MIT, or where ever it makes sense. Happy to make it all open source. I always intended to leave a record behind of some kind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Send me an email if you have any pointers. I would be willing to drive to Boston or NYC if people know where there's hardware. Of course when it's safe to do so, from a virus standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a project we did with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/15/uncleArnosBooks.html&quot;&gt;Uncle Arno's books&lt;/a&gt; a number of years ago. We did find a home for them at Portland State University. This is different, this is all digital stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, a medical researcher friend offers a theory why CV-like diseases slow down in the summer. Might not have to do with heat, rather the health of the people. We exercise more in summer than winter. We're generally in better shape, he says. A theory.</description>

			<description>On MSNBC last night, I learned something from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidfrum&quot;&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt; that I had read in one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-frum/&quot;&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; columns, but hearing him say it verbally brought it home in a whole new way. The reason McConnell wants the blue states to declare bankruptcy instead of defaulting is then the states will be administered by judges. The crazy corrupt Putin-approved judges he's been getting confirmed. So they can loot every last bit of money from the US. It's not enough to loot the US treasury, he wants to get the money of New York, California and Illinois, and also the purple and red states. It doesn't sound as good if he bullshits about Georgia, Texas and Arizona, but he wants their money too. Putin and his cronies are experts at hoovering up &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the money. They should give Frum a permanent ten minutes every night on MSNBC to explain stuff this way. (Also get him a better net connection.) It would at least be more interesting, we might even be able to head off some of the depravity.</description>

A few seconds after a new episode is available, the podcast moves to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/05/applePodcastsAppScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;top of the list&lt;/a&gt; and it starts downloading the new episode. I wonder how they do it. Is my iPhone polling the feed constantly? Is an Apple  server doing the polling and relaying a notice to all subscribed clients? Or perhaps they hook into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/02/rsscloudDomains.html&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; functionality that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/05/cloudElement.png&quot;&gt;supports&lt;/a&gt; (part of RSS 2.0).

That would be the best answer." created="Tue, 05 May 2020 17:08:49 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/voila.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/05.html#a170849"/>
