			<description>Why isnâ€™t there a Covid-19 game where you win by having your town not die before a treatment or vaccine is developed. When one of your citizens is infected you can isolate them for a bit and also do contact tracing. A mafia don in an orange jumpsuit shows up at random times and steals all your PPE! Itâ€™d be fun cause kids who master the game can explain it to their clueless Fox-watching parents and grandparents. They  could even be part of the game!</description>

I find this somewhat amazing. He got away with all the Russian michegas. But he wants to go back to it. Because as they say Covid-19 doesn't respond to his bullshit. We could learn from the virus.

			<description>Just heard a report on NPR that began with a quote from Trump, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie&quot;&gt;big bold lie&lt;/a&gt;, and they just went on as if he had made a good point. This has to stop. It's not saving my life, quite the contrary, it's killing people, to let Trump get away with lying about the role of testing. He says we have the highest numbers because we do the most testing. Yeah. Not true. And they went on to say that governors don't know why they need so much testing. What? Hello. Yes, everyone who cares knows. We need to know where the freaking virus is and isn't. That's why we test. It's the same reason we launch weather satellites, so we know where and when it's going to snow. I keep repeating this, hopefully the idea will spread. News should be in the business of saving my life and yours. It's never been more possible and more vital. And it's a good business model. If they're not just relaxing entertainment, if they &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;, we'll make sure they get the money they need. The news doesn't understand its own role.</description>

			<title>United flight crammed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1259165939037331456&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, Ethan Weiss was with a group of 25 nurses and doctors working in NYC hospitals for the past 2-4 weeks. They are going home. He says United flew them to NYC for free, got lots of great PR, and took &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1254197942732324867&quot;&gt;great care&lt;/a&gt; of them going out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;United wrote them &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1259171771191824385&quot;&gt;10 days ago&lt;/a&gt; to say the middle seats would all be empty. Clearly they are not empty.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1259310067066630144/photo/1&quot;&gt;departure board&lt;/a&gt; for United at Newark yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this is what everyone fears about flying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The United Airlines flight yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Mother's Day 2020</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My mother was a regular reader of this blog. Maybe she still reads it, where ever she is, whatever form she is in. I have women friends who read the blog, I think in a similar way to the way she read it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was a very smart person, lots of brain power, but also very wounded, and the wounds, which we shared in a way, made it hard for us to be close. Maybe toward the end of her life she opened up a bit, but she had a fear of men, given to her by her parents, and she passed that on to her children, in the weird way that parents give their agony to their children. But she read the blog. That was something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The author and his mother with the author's newborn brother.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I dream about her every night. They are not happy dreams, they are dreams of unresolved anger, disloyalty. But I also feel for her in ways I didn't when she was alive. I wish I had protected her, which is ridiculous because she was the mother and I was the child. But it's there nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish we could talk, but then I remember, we never accomplished anything with talk. Yet, she is the one who fed me, taught me, read to me, gave me her values, and ultimately was proud of me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was my mother and all that came with it. I hope she can read this and I hope she's happy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My mother's judgement</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Now that my parents have been gone for some considerable time, our differences come into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I felt that my life was dispensable, temporary, so I was ready to take risks that they didn't want me to take.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you took them at face value, they were sure I was going to fail and be dependent on them. That I would fail at what I was trying to do, and then be a failure at life. That could have been the outcome. I was certainly close a few times! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why I was willing to take such risks is something I don't know. I have theories about it but I'm too close to have a good idea. I am what I am, it never was in question that I would do risky things. I wanted to do big things from a very young age. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My parents on the other hand valued security above all else. They had steady jobs, savings accounts, were very careful with their money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Funny thing was that both my grandfathers were pretty sure I was doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though I overcame their objections, I don't think either of my parents ever forgot the judgement they formed years earlier, that I was a failure. On a personal level I still took big risks even if I had established myself from a productivity standpoint. (This was my mother's biggest value, that we be productive.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were depression era refugees in World War II. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a Boomer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think that explains a bunch of it, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they would be surprised to know that I actually did pick up most of their values re money. While I have been willing to roll the dice on new ideas I either thought had potential or I believed in for other reasons, otherwise I am quite conservative in the way I live, though it took me a while to arrive at that. Acquiring too much is a burden, living as lightly as you can is a good value. That was my mother's thing. I never have been very organized in record-keeping. In that I am original, both my parents were very good at that. Maybe that's my act of rebellion. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also people who think the story of Boomers is written, consider Covid-19. We're still here, it's part of our story too. For all the hardship my parents' generation survived, they never had to deal with a pandemic. I'd love to send them an email about that.

				<source:outline text="I felt that my life was dispensable, temporary, so I was ready to take risks that they didn't want me to take." permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/10/142556.html?title=myMothersJudgement#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="If you took them at face value, they were sure I was going to fail and be dependent on them. That I would fail at what I was trying to do, and then be a failure at life. That could have been the outcome. I was certainly close a few times! ;-)" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/10/142556.html?title=myMothersJudgement#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="Why I was willing to take such risks is something I don't know. I have theories about it but I'm too close to have a good idea. I am what I am, it never was in question that I would do risky things. I wanted to do big things from a very young age." permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/10/142556.html?title=myMothersJudgement#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="My parents on the other hand valued security above all else. They had steady jobs, savings accounts, were very careful with their money." permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/10/142556.html?title=myMothersJudgement#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="Funny thing was that both my grandfathers were pretty sure I was doing the right thing." permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/10/142556.html?title=myMothersJudgement#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="Even though I overcame their objections, I don't think either of my parents ever forgot the judgement they formed years earlier, that I was a failure. On a personal level I still took big risks even if I had established myself from a productivity standpoint. (This was my mother's biggest value, that we be productive.)" created="Sun, 10 May 2020 14:26:55 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/10/142556.html?title=myMothersJudgement#a142655"/>

				<source:outline text="I think they would be surprised to know that I actually did pick up most of their values re money. While I have been willing to roll the dice on new ideas I either thought had potential or I believed in for other reasons, otherwise I am quite conservative in the way I live, though it took me a while to arrive at that. Acquiring too much is a burden, living as lightly as you can is a good value. That was my mother's thing. I never have been very organized in record-keeping. In that I am original, both my parents were very good at that. Maybe that's my act of rebellion. ;-)" created="Sun, 10 May 2020 14:34:59 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/10/142556.html?title=myMothersJudgement#a143459"/>
				<source:outline text="Also people who think the story of Boomers is written, consider Covid-19. We're still here, it's part of our story too. For all the hardship my parents' generation survived, they never had to deal with a pandemic. I'd love to send them an email about that.

			<title>Soon it will be my turn, and yours</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;After I moved to the mountains in March 2019, I've only been to NYC once, to have dinner with a friend from Calif who was visiting. Long before Covid. I don't really identify with the city much anymore. It feels far away. But it isn't far away. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was raised in Queens -- in Jackson Heights and northeast Flushing. I'm guessing people in Flushing are doing ok relative Covid, but Jackson Heights is burning. Lots of people I rode the subways with are sick, very sick, dying or dead. Like the victims of a tsunami in SE Asia or a hurricane in Puerto Rico. In some ways it feels far away, but it isn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It just hit me in a visceral way when I thought of what happens when I will have to wait in soup lines after the collapse of the food supply in two or three months (or weeks as things are going). By then the infection will be even more out of control than it is now. My next thought -- I live in farm country, it's incredibly rich and fertile and productive place, so I'll be ok, but then I realize that food will be going to feed NYC which is just two hours to the south. Or it'll be feeding the people in the Hamptons, Martha's Vineyard or the Trumps and their buddies. It'll disappear just like the PPE did, down the Mafia hole. Going to Russia and Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The press meanwhile is covering &lt;i&gt;past&lt;/i&gt; failures of Trump, how they blew it in January. But they're blowing it in May, and that's going to spread poverty and death to new parts of America outside NYC. Soon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The virus is in the White House. I bet it's in Congress too and maybe the Supreme Court. It's in DOD and DOJ and Homeland Security. Government houses people densely just like meat packing plants, prisons, nursing homes. Lots of vulnerable people taking big risks. They aren't any more immune than you and I are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why I say journalism's business model is &quot;Save my life.&quot; We need to get back on track, I don't care how we do it, now is already too late for 80K Americans. But soon it'll be your turn and my turn. &lt;i&gt;Soon. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A couple of nights ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+maddow&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Rachel Maddow&lt;/a&gt; told the story of a group of entrepreneurs in Salt Lake City who set up a free Covid-19 testing program. Yes, they had the arrogance that's common to tech entrepreneurs, I know it very well. But they were trying to do good. I don't often notice the sarcasm and superiority in Maddow's stories, but I did for this one. I kept waiting for her to say what evil they had done, but it never came. Some doctors commented that their arrogance was ugly, and their tests could suck, sure, but it colored everything I hear from Maddow in a new way, the way she &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=seething&quot;&gt;seethed&lt;/a&gt; when she talked about Facebook a couple of years ago, from ignorance. In that case I knew the facts. So why not just report the facts, without so much attitude, and let us make up our own minds. And then I wondered how much do I listen to her for the superiority versus getting any real information. Another way to see it is what if a Fox News person used the tone she used. Would you see it then. I actually shut her off in the middle of the show last night, I want to re-think whether she is a force for good, and should I be paying attention to her at all. I know I've been here before with her and the rest of MSNBC. There aren't a whole lot of choices.</description>

			<description>We don't know who will be affected by Covid-19 in the future. People assume most young people don't have symptoms, but we really have no idea. One thing we do know that it isn't binary. You don't necessarily just recover back to who you were before you got the disease. The symptoms linger. The damage in some cases is permanent. Chickenpox shows up again later in life as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054&quot;&gt;shingles&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Covid is a serious illness. People who play politics with it, and want to convince you it's not serious, don't have a clue, because even the most skilled and educated medical scientists don't know what lies ahead.</description>

			<description>Science fiction version of today's news. First the air pollution was gone. Then there was the spring that never came. Snow in May. Next up, the coral reefs come back to life, occupied by alien beings. It's the first we learn that we aren't alone. They would like to speak to our leader.</description>

			<title>My backups</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a storage unit in Berkeley with all kinds of random stuff in it. When I moved to the new house in the mountains, I had a lot of room, so I had the storage unit contents moved out here. There were a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/diskbackups1.png&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/diskbackups2.png&quot;&gt;cartons&lt;/a&gt; of backups from Living Videotext and UserLand in the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't have hardware to read any of them, but I'd love to back them up somewhere like the Computer History Museum, or Stanford or MIT, or where ever it makes sense. Happy to make it all open source. I always intended to leave a record behind of some kind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Send me an email if you have any pointers. I would be willing to drive to Boston or NYC if people know where there's hardware. Of course when it's safe to do so, from a virus standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a project we did with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/15/uncleArnosBooks.html&quot;&gt;Uncle Arno's books&lt;/a&gt; a number of years ago. We did find a home for them at Portland State University. This is different, this is all digital stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, a medical researcher friend offers a theory why CV-like diseases slow down in the summer. Might not have to do with heat, rather the health of the people. We exercise more in summer than winter. We're generally in better shape, he says. A theory.</description>

			<description>On MSNBC last night, I learned something from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidfrum&quot;&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt; that I had read in one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-frum/&quot;&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; columns, but hearing him say it verbally brought it home in a whole new way. The reason McConnell wants the blue states to declare bankruptcy instead of defaulting is then the states will be administered by judges. The crazy corrupt Putin-approved judges he's been getting confirmed. So they can loot every last bit of money from the US. It's not enough to loot the US treasury, he wants to get the money of New York, California and Illinois, and also the purple and red states. It doesn't sound as good if he bullshits about Georgia, Texas and Arizona, but he wants their money too. Putin and his cronies are experts at hoovering up &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the money. They should give Frum a permanent ten minutes every night on MSNBC to explain stuff this way. (Also get him a better net connection.) It would at least be more interesting, we might even be able to head off some of the depravity.</description>

			<title>Let's not self-destruct this time</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Think about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWe7wTVbLUU&quot;&gt;moment&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 when future-president &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_More_Perfect_Union_(speech)&quot;&gt;Obama spoke&lt;/a&gt; to explain what happened when his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Wright_controversy&quot;&gt;pastor&lt;/a&gt; was discovered to have said some true but unpleasant things about race in America. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Obama put it in context, honestly, sympathetically, passionately, forcefully and presidentially. We need a moment like that, for gender. To validate the grievances of women, but also to test every accusation carefully, with justice, in the way envisioned by our Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In something as consequential as a presidential election, there has to be a time when you must speak or forever hold your peace. To make the accusation at the point when it can do the greatest damage not just to the candidate, but to the country, even to the world, we can't allow that. Even if Biden did what he's accused of, the choice of timing, when it was sure to do the greatest damage, is a much greater abuse with much larger consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The press only looks at these things from the point of view of the two parties, and as a result the conversations we have about it often ignore our own point of view. With all the death and disease and economic hardship, all the fear and a complete void of leadership in the US government, we can't ignore our own interests. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have to stay on course to at least have a chance to right this by November if not sooner. This is not the time to stop and self-destruct. We have to be smarter and more willful than that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It's great to get John Naughton's &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. He writes frequently about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/21/191743.html?title=theEbbAndFlowOfLockdown&quot;&gt;contact tracing&lt;/a&gt;, as he did &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/saturday-2-may-2020&quot;&gt;last night&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that our phones can help with contact tracing, and we should be willing to give up some privacy. This is an emergency. I don't agree with Schneier who dismisses the help mobile devices could offer, but some of the comments on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/05/me_on_covad-19_.html&quot;&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt; were right on, imho. More later for sure.</description>

			<description>Maybe journalism can stop tiptoeing around the plan, and just say what it is. 1. Reduce new infections to zero. 2. Contact tracing. 3. Low-cost, fast testing. That's how we get out of this.</description>
