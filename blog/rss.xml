			<description>A bit of advice to Joe Biden, trying to satisfy the press with pushback against Trump slurs. &quot;Remember folks, Trump is the Birther dude.&quot; Come back at Trump with the truth, take the spotlight off you. Give the press all they need to stop dragging your family through the dirt.</description>

			<description>Today is the first of two Q&amp;A days in &lt;i&gt;The Impeachment of Donald J. Trump.&lt;/i&gt; Here's the question I'd ask of the president's defenders. Trump did something bad. If we don't remove him, assume he'll do more of that. And so will future presidents. We could throw out the Constitution. The presidency would be a for-profit enterprise, with the president selling favors to foreign leaders in return for favors and money. Could he do similar deals with the head of the FBI and DOJ? Why not? Would you pay taxes to such a government? Why? The Constitution would no longer have any force. Congress no longer serves as an oversight on the executive, you could all go home, or maybe you would blackmail local officials, of course kicking up a taste to President Trump (or whoever). You say we should acquit Trump. So this new form of government is okay with you? And if it's not (we hope) what should we do?</description>

It worked fine as long as there was no HTML markup in the text. I explain in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_a6dEoad5c&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, to the best of my ability, why that seems like it should be utterly simple, but isn't.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt;, current editor-in-chief at Buzzfeed News is a good choice to be the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/business/media/ben-smith-buzzfeed-new-york-times.html&quot;&gt;media columnist&lt;/a&gt; at the NYT. He has more of a bloggers perspective imho. I like that when he got his hands on the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier&quot;&gt;Steele dossier&lt;/a&gt; he shared it with the world. He got in hot water with other professional news people, but why would a reporter feel compelled to keep such a hot news item private? Isn't their job to make important information public? I came to like him listening to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/david-remnick-and-ben-smith-discuss-how-the-media-should-cover-the-president&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with David Remnick of the New Yorker.</description>

			<description>In a recent version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/electron/electron&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;, they grabbed the Cmd-` keystroke to do something in the system. I was using it in an app that I depend on, use all day every day, I'm using it right now as I write this. Now Cmd-` doesn't work. The command is still in a menu, but it's way more work. Every time I have to do that work I project evil thoughts at the person who did this. I understand there's supposed to be a way around it, a way to grab the keystroke back from Electron, but I spent a half-day not getting it to work. I don't have that many half-days to throw away. Now I'm seeing the same thing happen in Chrome. Cmd-` -- they must think there are no &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&quot;&gt;SPAs&lt;/a&gt; that use it, or they don't care. Now I wonder what the groundrules are. Are all my keystrokes up for grabs by the system vendor? I so vastly preferred the web when the bigco's didn't throw their weight around. When they were trying to coalesce to a standard (which they did) instead of shatter the platform into bits (which seems to be happening now).</description>

What Susan Collins says at this point is something that must be available to historians. She's a government official, responsible to the citizens of Maine.</description>

			<title>TV news can multiplex</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/200126/p59#a200126p59&quot;&gt;so much news&lt;/a&gt; breaking in the impeachment, with the trial resuming the next day, I wanted to hook into the flow produced by MSNBC and CNN, and through them senators making decisions about the trial, probably in real time. Some of that might be visible. We spend so much time in stasis, with the story never changing, when things are finally in motion, that's the time to focus. I had no doubt the reporters were in their studios, working on various stories, but there was no way for them to connect with people like me, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Kobe_Bryant&quot;&gt;Kobe Bryant died&lt;/a&gt;. The two things aren't very related. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a basketball fan. I've spent countless hours watching him play, a couple of times in person. I could have understood playing greatest hits of Kobe, he was an incredible player, but that isn't what they were doing. They were in an endless loop of people (imho) faking expressions of grief. Their stories left out all that was really interesting about the guy. He wasn't a nice person. Nothing wrong wtih that in sports. Now he's a saint? Really? It's a ritual that for some weird reason freezes the news media into a loop of wholly irrelevant and dishonest pseudo-news. Over and over again and again. Nothing new is happening. None of the people being interviewed are really incapacitated with grief. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't mind if there's programming for people who want to do this, but in 2020, the networking tech between my house and their studio is broad enough that we could do both. That's my point. It's time to fix TV with the features of the net. All this stuff is going over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&quot;&gt;TCP&lt;/a&gt; these days. When I'm watching TV on my 65-inch screen, the video comes through the Spectrum app on my Roku desktop. There's lots of room for more apps. Let's go with this. Time to move. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Put the cursor in the middle of a paragraph. Press cmd-return to split the paragraph at the cursor position, creating two headlines. Simple, I do this manually all the time, with copy-paste which is more tedious and error-prone. Also going to do the inverse, cmd-backspace to merge two headlines.</description>

			<description>Continue to be impressed with Brian Lehrer's Impeachment podcast. Highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/impeachment-daily-podcast/episodes/ben-wittes&quot;&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; with Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare. I was going to ask Lehrer to do a show on what the US will be like after a Trump acquittal. This episode is a good start. Before watching another hour of CNN or MSNBC, listen to this. You'll learn a lot more.</description>

			<title>Testing is needed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Andy Sylvester &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/25/200702.html?title=andysVoicemailcast&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; yesterday what can he do to help. Here's one thing that really holds back progress. When I ship a new version of a piece of software, test it. If you don't know how to do software testing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+test+software&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt;. This is a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to release a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; soon, maybe today or tomorrow. I will have verified it works on my machine, for what I use it for. But there may be deal stoppers for others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These days, even experienced developers write ridiculous bug reports. One guy sent me an email saying he couldn't unsub from the nightly email. No clue as to what he did, or what happened. He just said it didn't work and asked if I knew what the problem was. There's nothing I can do for him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;20-plus years ago we had a community that tested the new stuff, and gave us good bug reports. Then we could get some work done. One of them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+terry+teague&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Terry Teague&lt;/a&gt;, was a one-man QA department. He worked for Apple doing testing, but volunteered for community projects like ours, in his spare time, out of the goodness of his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I release the new version of LO2, I will write up the changes, here, on the blog, and provide a thread on GitHub for problem reports. I will be listening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/05/01/professionalUsers.html&quot;&gt;Professional users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Republican senators should watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRoVIpczcrY&amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;this scene&lt;/a&gt; from Game of Thrones. You see that guy Joffrey, the guy talking about &quot;putting a son&quot; in the attractive woman -- he's a lot like your leader (except he has nice hair). Wait for the punchline. You're going to love it!</description>

			<description>The Dems should embrace the Repubs-with-heads-on-spike meme. They would be doing the Repubs a favor actually because even if they deny it, we know that some of their heads &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; be on spikes before long. Let's debate that on CNN.</description>

			<description>Here's what my day's been like so far. Woke up at 9:30AM. Made some breakfast, turned on WNYC on my Alexa. Listened to their summary of the previous days' impeachment speeches, no mention of Pikes and how angry Republican senators were (thanks for that), then at 10AM they started broadcasting the speech by the White House counsel (who, I thought was supposed to represent the office of the president, not the president in person, but what of it) and he started into the lying and deception. I couldn't handle it. Told Alexa to stop. Finished my orange juice and skipped the coffee and went upstairs and back to bed. Woke up at about 1PM. Guess I needed the sleep. Would you believe it's raining in January. I moved my car out of the carport and into the rain, it could use a wash, totally mud-covered. I feel depressed. I think we're over the edge again, about to free-fall into another worst thing in the world. God please help America. Your devoted servant, Admiral Davey.</description>

			<description>My mother was a beauty. Always I had the most beautiful mother in school. The other kids said that. I was proud. She married a man, my father, who was not beautiful. I found myself wishing the other day that she had married a beautiful man, then I would be as beautiful as she was. But then I thought, then, I would not be me. Or would I? I have no idea. I'm going to try to get some work done now.</description>

			<title>Andy's voicemailcast</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andysylvester.com/2020/01/22/thoughts-from-a-user/&quot;&gt;Andy Sylvester&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime user of my stuff, recorded a voicemailcast. He did an &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/fe&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt; too. My comments follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Andy, thanks for the voicemailcast. We've only met once face to face that I know of, and that was in a noisy place (in Portland), and there were a lot of other people there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This voicemailcast multiplied my understanding of who you are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it is hard to collaborate with me on the actual code, because of the way I work, and that's not likely to change any time soon. Also coding has not been the limiting factor for a long time. It's how to attract writers and thinkers in all fields. I have a massive body of working code. As I said in the podcast, from this point it's about selecting bits to integrate into the current writing environment. With &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;, people will be using the same blogging environment I use. So we can evolve together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt; for a few years, it's what I switched from in 2017 when I decided to go back to the way I blogged before Twitter, Facebook, RSS, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also if Wordpress works for you, that's great. It just isn't fluid enough for me. And btw, Doc has shown me how to make the outliner even more fluid. I haven't implemented his request yet, but now I see how much it would help. More on that later.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; ways to collaborate. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/what-is-rsscloud/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; has been developing and managing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://walkthrough.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; server functionality. Perfect because we have a well-defined API for how our software interacts. He tells me he's doing a new release. So helping him might be an option, if he needs help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's my number one request of the world -- what I want most that other people could create, is a &lt;u&gt;Linux version of Frontier&lt;/u&gt;. I am in a precarious place on the Mac. The version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; that I use as a code-writing and devops tool does not run on the latest Mac OS. We knew this was coming. I bought a super hot iMac Pro just before their OS switch, so I'm good as long as this machine continues to run, and the backup machines I have which are older continue to run. But I'm three hardware failures away from having no way forward. That's not good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Linux is great. All my servers run Ubuntu now, all my server code is in Node.js. Imagine how smooth it would be to have my development environment run there too. Lots of synergies, and safety. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html&quot;&gt;Ted Howard&lt;/a&gt; is the main guy on that stuff. Without his work I would have lost use of Frontier a long time ago. BTW this is a project I personally would put money into. You talk about the economics of software, there is a new bit of info on the economics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also next time you do a voicemailcast please send me a link via email. I almost didn't see this, and that would have been a shame. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My least favorite thing is people explaining why they unsub from your feed. I don't care. I have a motto. &quot;Don't slam the door on the way out.&quot; That way you know you really are going in peace, vs the passive-aggressive control freakery you're actually practicing. Now suppose for the sake of argument, I try to make you happy and dump every political idea I have. Great. You're happy. You feel powerful. But then someone else wants me to stop writing about tech ideas that come to me, because it makes them feel inferior because last week I posted one they didn't understand. Keep going, eventually there's nothing left here. So, I've been doing this for over 25 years. By now I've heard from every control freak on the planet. Heh probably not, but it feels that way.</description>

			<title>Only two permanent Olympic venues</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We, as a world, should build one great venue for summer olympics and one for winter. Why? Mostly symbolic. To say to the world, to ourselves, decisively, that we can work together, and compromise, for the benefit of humanity and the planet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way, we don't build a new United Nations every four years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further, no more spectacular displays of carbon consumption. Those made sense &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition&quot;&gt;127 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, at the dawn of electricity tech. Now it's rubbing salt in the wound. And it makes clear that we can and will sacrifice for our survival.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, no more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockefellercenter.com/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/&quot;&gt;Christmas trees&lt;/a&gt;. And turn down the lights in Times Square. You can't air condition the outdoors. (In NYC amazingly, there are places that do.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Symbolism first, change the way people think, shock people out of their sense of normalcy, then rebuild our civilization around the new low-carbon-emission ethos. You can tell your children and grandchildren that you remember a day when we built a new temporary city every two years for a two week athletic competition, and &lt;i&gt;never used it again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I don't like the way it looks in readers, and I want more features, but if that's where some people want to read my stuff, of course I'm happy. The important thing is that you read, listen and watch (and think of course).</description>

			<description>An idea for a recurring sketch on a comedy show. Two actors, one plays a Trump supporter. Someone who speaks like an actual Trumper, who says things that echo what's said on Fox. Vary the gender, where they're from, etc. Each time, they discuss current events with an actor who is not a Trump supporter, serious, plays it straight. Now here's where it gets interesting. The Trump supporter realizes how wrong it was to support Trump. They do something to demonstrate that they see the light. Remember, they're actors. It's scripted. So the outcome is always the same. I would love to watch this, just for the release. Also it would really piss off Trump supporters, which is an extra bonus. Worth trying maybe on SNL or the Daily Show.</description>

			<description>I keep hearing that the outcome of The Trial of Trump is either acquit or remove, but there's a third possibility that we should prepare for. He might not be removed but is not acquitted either. Say the vote is 55 to convict vs 45 to acquit. He remains president, but a majority of the Senate voted to remove him. That's not a win. It shakes his tree. &quot;Keep fucking with us and maybe lose some more support in the Senate and maybe next time we have enough votes to put you out.&quot; Before you say that's not going to happen, it might. The Repubs are at least as savvy as we are (heh, we're babes in the woods compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/04.html&quot;&gt;McConnell&lt;/a&gt;), and know that some of their senators come from purple states like Maine, Colorado and Arizona. And there may be other senators who may want to vote to convict because they're more independent, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romney.senate.gov/&quot;&gt;Romney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/&quot;&gt;Murkowski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/&quot;&gt;Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, for example. The Repubs have room to help some of those senators without giving up ten more months of stacking the courts with unqualified Republicans. They might want to send a signal to El PresidentÃ© that the US isn't &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; his banana republic yet. It's not an impossible outcome. It's all negotiable in politics.</description>

			<description>I just did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/fc&quot;&gt;transition&lt;/a&gt; on instantoutliner.com. Complete rewrite of the server from top to bottom. I want to do a bunch of development work here, so I had to have a clean foundation. The previous version was last updated in 2016, so it was using the old technology. If you published an outline in the last few days, I might have lost the link to it. It shouldn't have happened but it did. And thanks again to Doc Searls for helping be the other side of &lt;i&gt;users and developers party together. &lt;/i&gt;It's the formula that works.</description>
