			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1225451396721496064&quot;&gt;She is so talented&lt;/a&gt;. I can't believe we didn't use this talent more effectively in the past. Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1225451396721496064&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, I think Bernie and Warren should sit down and let Pelosi lead the revolution.</description>

Your donations are divided between them. I just gave $100. It's a good idea, good for the country.</description>

			<description>Tony Haile, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.com/&quot;&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartbeat&quot;&gt;Chartbeat&lt;/a&gt;, had a really &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arctictony/status/1225253452168781825&quot;&gt;good idea&lt;/a&gt;. When the Senate votes on something consequential, such as whether to remove the president, let's have a readout that shows the number of people the Yes votes represent, by state, and the number of people the No votes represent. It would measure how far our government is from being a democracy. I would love to see this as a website.</description>

			<description>Randall Neff did an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/06/Senate-vote-2020-02-05.xlsx&quot;&gt;Excel spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; for the impeachment trial. It wasn't as lopsided as I imagined. Roughly 52% to convict, 48% to acquit. The reps of a majority of Americans thought he was guilty, but not nearly enough to convict him. Here's the spreadsheet &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/06/Senate-vote-2020-02-05.pdf&quot;&gt;in PDF&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Why is Trump's approval rating going up? This question came up on Brian Lehrer's fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;WNYC radio show&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Here's my theory. During the trial, Trump wasn't controlling the public conversation. So we didn't always hear about Trump's latest outrage every minute of every day. If he were to tone it down permanently, only spoke when a president would normally speak, he might be more popular.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1225428106330148869&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; still meets my requirements for a good Democratic candidate for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/05.html#a150458&quot;&gt;the plan&lt;/a&gt; I outlined yesterday. My only concern was her confidence, but she's really good in this interview. I would definitely vote and work for her, without reservations.</description>

			<description>It's been a while since we had an Occam's News report. Here's the latest. In the impeachment trial, if the jury could have been sure there would be no retribution for a vote of guilty, a lot more would have voted that way. A bunch of them would have voted to acquit even if there would be no retribution, because they think the US is going to privatize massive parts of the government, and they want to be in position to get some of that. Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz.</description>

			<description>I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1224834573688766466&quot;&gt;James Carville&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC last night. He speaks for me. The goal of this election is to get power. To do that we need to run a smart campaign as in 2018. He says the party needs a new chairman, who should it be -- he says Ask Nancy Pelosi. Beat the drum with talking points that rarely stray off health care, climate, education. Over and over.  Take power and get the Repubs out of the way and then do what needs to be done. Pick a presidential candidate that fits this plan. Nothing more complex. We're not electing god, we're electing someone who can lead us out of the nightmare of a morass we are now in. Wake the fuck up people who think the election is about the candidates. It is not. Once we have a plan, the candidate will follow the plan. That's all. Think like someone in a smoke filled room. We wanted that power, now learn to use it. That's what Carville said last night. Really passionate and smart.</description>

			<description>The only criteria for a candidate: I want someone who, when a Republican who believes in the rule of law sees them, they think -- I could vote for them. Even better, I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to vote for them. In this election there are two sides, one side believes in the rule of law, the other doesn't. It isn't about any issue other than that.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I signed up for the Bloomberg campaign. I take him at his word, if he isn't the nominee, he will back the actual candidate with his money and organization. I hope he starts a political social network, the one I thought Obama was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;, not to make money (eg FB, Twitter), rather to allow us to organize politically without interference from trolls. Someone has to do this, I hope Bloomberg will.</description>

			<title>We lost the war</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1225111846207684608&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; by Joe Biden just now where he asks if the government he was part of was a failure. When you ask the question like that, the answer is somewhat startling. Yes. The Obama government was a failure. In the same way the French government of 1940 was a failure. Sure, they passed some good laws, and the people of France were happy, but when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France&quot;&gt;Germans marched into Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1940, you would have to say that the existing government of France failed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We were attacked in 2016, and we lost. How do I know we lost? We're not mounting a defense. We didn't counter-attack. If we had, and we had won, Putin would be gone, and Russia would be establishing an American style government. Instead, Putin is fine, and we're installing, gradually, a Russian-style government. That's the only explanation for what's happening in the Senate this afternoon at 4PM Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden, if he has any honor, will withdraw from the race. We lost. He was VP when we lost. We cannot under any circumstances go back to that approach. That would be certainly a loser. If there's any hope for us, we need a very radical departure from the previous path, and I do not mean Bernie Sanders. People who think that are as much in denial as Joe Biden was before he asked the question. Now that he has, if he has guts like he says he does, it's time to step aside. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Is there a reason Nancy Pelosi can't be the next president? If there is I don't know what it is. In fact, she is our leader. And a very good one at that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't know why people take the shortcut of saying other people are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/09.html#a205150&quot;&gt;tone deaf&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously the person who they're saying it to doesn't agree. Do they really want to argue about that? What's the point. It's like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTP_SdjD5ms&quot;&gt;Donald Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; is screaming and pointing at someone who is not yet possessed. Look I found a human, the accuser seems to be saying. It's not a good look.</description>

			<title>Takeaways from Iowa</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of takeaways from last night's meltdown of the vote-counting system in Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Do not depend on your online systems. You must have a backup system that's tested as well as the primary system.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There was another probably more important story last night, where real news had been made during the day. The obsession of the previous week -- impeachment. Since you didn't have anything going on in Iowa, why not provide coverage of what happened in Congress during the day when no one was watching. Might have had a positive impact for the country. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On MSNBC there was a party atmosphere. As if finally we don't have to talk about doom and gloom, for a few minutes we can go back to the naivete of the 2016 election when we could laugh about Trump. Or who knows what they thought was so funny. The news, which ostensibly is their business, is as funny as a heart attack during a nuclear holocaust. Having a party on TV now would be like laughing as the world was mourning Kobe Bryant. Look, CNN and MSNBC should be news rooms. If you don't know what that means, either get out of the way, or learn. Your job is to always be asking yourself Is This Actually News? Last night they had nothing. And they acted like idiots. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At one point Chris Hayes commented you know it's fun to actually not view voters in the aggregate. Yes Chris, we think, we have ideas, we see things you'll never see, and you could stop and figure out what's important about your new realization. That there are way more of us than you, and we're the real power in the country, not the politicians you fawn over, and the other journalists of course.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've said this many times. If you want to help yourselves and the country, move your newsroom to the midwest. Maybe you'll have to do all your interviews over the net. It's getting pretty good. But at least the moderators' perspective will be altered somewhat, will get out of that fetid putrid bubble you all live in. Important stuff is happening, and you're blowing it. It's time to shake things up in journalism. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; that Iowa melted down. It'll wake everyone up. Even if the caucus is a total loss, it's a small price to pay to get people to pay attention to the way we're using online systems in politics and journalism. Especially in 2020 where our systems are undefended against terrorism, it's a certainty we will be replaying this, on a much larger scale, at some time during the process.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why is this process so freaking long! The horserace provides good TV, I guess, if what you want to do is play video games during the broadcast (that's what I do), but we've got other more pressing business than the minutia that people think of as news in this period. It's in the boredom of the interminably long election that Hillary's Emails were invented. We would never have had time for Hunter Biden and Burisma. The length of the process is something the Repubs have mastered for their mischief. Let's not give them such a tempting target. First primary is in July, say, and it's five huge swing states. Then the rest. That's it. Then a convention and Election Day. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you get a chance, please listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1224428088953581569&quot;&gt;Adam Schiff's closing speech&lt;/a&gt; in the impeachment trial. I have a feeling a lot of people didn't hear this historic, passionate plea for America. The Repubs in Congress aren't listening, but we imho must. It's really right up there with JFK's inauguration speech in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy&quot;&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Schiff and the House Democrats for standing up for America.</description>

			<description>Complaining that Bloomberg is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbc-contributor-clashes-with-bernie-campaign-co-chair-nina-turner-after-she-blasts-bloomberg-as-an-oligarch/&quot;&gt;oligarch&lt;/a&gt; in the age of Citizens United is like (I was trying to think of an analogy and failed) ridiculous. Of course he's an oligarch. And his ads are good Democratic values ads. He knows how to market. Kick back and thank god someone does. (This was the beginning of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1224522337288171522&quot;&gt;long rant&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. Enjoy!)</description>

			<description>I used to call for presidential candidates to try to work with Repubs, but that's changed since Friday's vote re evidence for impeachment. They are complicit, as corrupt as the president. There is no working with any Republican who is in Congress at this time.</description>

			<description>Over on Facebook Terry Heaton &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/03/terry.png&quot;&gt;posted a screed&lt;/a&gt; in support of Jennifer Lopez in last night's SuperBowl halftime show. To me it was a big meh. I find those kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows#1960s&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; unimpressive, the music not interesting. I came to watch football, not dance. I'm not kidding. Even Prince, the Stones, Bruce, etc didn't get me off. I was in the kitchen during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrobe_malfunction&quot;&gt;wardrobe malfunction&lt;/a&gt;. But -- Terry's post is noteworthy because he ends it with this line: &quot;America is facing the destruction of our democracy, and we're worried about this?&quot; We should make a button out of that. Tatoo it on our forehead so we see it in the mirror. We need to be &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; to each other, find ways to combine our power, not minimize it. Let's go Mets! and thanks for listening.</description>

			<description>It turns out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150#issuecomment-581407743&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; of the problem that a user was experiencing with the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/privacybadger&quot;&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; from EFF. I gather it's something that a user can disable, so if you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; and you're running Privacy Badger, you should disable their distrust of scripting.com and then LO2 should work as it should.</description>

			<description>I have to say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&quot;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; has been a constant bummer and pain in the ass. For an organization that I should be able to support (and have, see below), they are always doing shit like this. When they sued the guy who claimed to have invented podcasting, they didn't respond to my emails or blog posts begging them not to take the approach they took. I felt it's important to get on the record how media types like podcasting come about. They didn't care. So much for being on the electronic frontier. It seems to me we should be on the same side in everything, and when we're not we should listen to each other. I gave the EFF $5K, which was then and is now a lot of money for me, when they were founded by Mitch Kapor, John Gilmor and John Perry Barlow, in 1990. I believe in the mission, but often do not believe in the implementation. Thanks for listening.</description>

			<description>The only football team I've ever been a fan of, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers&quot;&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;, is in tonight's SuperBowl. I'm angry and frustrated that the NFL won't hire former Niners quarterback &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick&quot;&gt;Colin Kaepernick&lt;/a&gt;. I also remember the intellect, wisdom, character, professionalism, talent and luck of the Niners of the 80s and 90s. So just for tonight, I'll be a football fan again. Go Niners! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🏈&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, to tech-savvy users who are regulars here. Please pitch in and help test the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/01.html#a174348&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub, the problems tend to be technical, though the typical user of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cribsheet.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; is not. If you've looked for a way to pitch in, this is where I need the most help. Keep an outline on &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. When there's a new release try editing it. Do the changes stick when you reload the page? Try creating a new outline. Open an existing one. Log off and log on. Go through the menus and try all the commands. We're looking for breakage, something that used to work but because of changes doesn't work now. A lot of stuff changed in this release. But most of it isn't visible to users. Help me out. This is foundational work. I need LO2 to work for people, smoothly. Thanks.</description>

			<description>Trump is picking a fight with Michael Bloomberg, re his height. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ginasmith888/status/1224037007673815040&quot;&gt;Gina Smith&lt;/a&gt; points out that Bloomberg is an inch taller than Putin. Heh. And then I read that Bloomberg's spokesperson, Julie Wood (a woman, this is important) said this: &quot;The president is lying. He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity, and his spray-on tan.&quot;  You know, this is the first time in four years Trump has been in presidential politics, talking about people's bodies and demeanor, that someone has come back at him with this line of attack, which is totally valid. When you're being bullied by someone so obviously vulnerable, give it back to him. It's even &lt;s&gt;worse&lt;/s&gt; better when a woman says a man is a liar, bald, fat, and wears makeup. Trust me on that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

If it's up to the voters, can we have the information we need to make a decision. Bolton's testimony is vital. As is the documentary evidence. I've served on a jury all the way to verdict, so I know how this works.</description>

			<title>Bojack finale, initial thoughts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Quick thoughts on the finale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6&quot;&gt;Bojack&lt;/a&gt;. Spoilers follow. I think they planned the second-to-last episode as the actual final episode. Had they done that I would have said who ever thought a comedy like Bojack Horseman would try something so ambitious, and even better, pull it off. But they added one more plot twist, it's really hard to parse, and the rest of the final episode is weird and repetitive, and at the end punts the ending. Still a groundbreaking show that's often LOL funny. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/whyYouMustWatchBojackHorseman.html&quot;&gt;wish&lt;/a&gt; all my friends would watch it so we can talk about it. Now I'll take some time and read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
