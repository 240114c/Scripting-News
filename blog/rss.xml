			<description>This morning I heard a segment on NPR about the SXSW cancellation. Interviewed the mayor. They talked about protecting Austin, but missed the bigger picture. An event like SXSW could be a hub that distributes the virus to the communities that visitors return to.</description>

			<description>A simple idea. We need testing of the Covid-19 virus. More testing is better -- and sooner. The US government isn't moving fast enough. Maybe Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple could get together to help us get tested, and then help scientists learn as much about where we're at as soon as possible. We need a Manhattan project, and it seems the capabilities of the tech industry would be well-applied here.</description>

			<title>Notes on Covid-19</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;These ideas are going to seem horribly naive in a few days probably, but based on lots of reading and listening this is what I think. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until there is massive testing we can't know where the virus is. Assuming it's everywhere is better than assuming it's nowhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emergency.yale.edu/be-prepared/shelter-place&quot;&gt;Shelter in place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;Self-quarantine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The reason to self-quarantine is two-fold. 1. To minimize the chance that you get the virus and 2. to slow its transmission. It uses our bodies to get to other bodies. If we don't have it, we can't transmit it. If we do, if we don't move around we can't transmit it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Only go out to get food and other supplies, and to work if you can. That's an ideal of course, not achievable in most countries, esp not the US, which doesn't have health care for all, or paid sick leave, or for that matter a functioning government.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hope that essential services can be maintained, electric, water, the supply chain for food, health care. Expect lots of outages. Hope is really all we have at this point when it comes to maintaining our way of life. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the government can't implement massive testing, we have to do it. We'll need excellent data management functions so we can do all kinds of queries on the data, to determine what comes next. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to say this, we should get Trump out of the loop of this, he's much more lethal than the virus. The government that comes after Trump, hopefully very soon, must implement a TARP-like program to vastly expand health care funding and funneling money to people who can't go to work because they have the virus, to help slow transmission. Also to parents who have to stay home to take care of kids who aren't going to school. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The rate cut by the Fed was insane btw, if we get out of this, we're going to need the ability to drop interest rates to stimulate the economy (experience from Katrina, a stopped economy is slow to restart). The rate cut can't do anything to stimulate an economy that is coming to a halt for non-market reasons. If people have more money in their pocket (they won't but if they did) they aren't going to go to Walmart to buy a new fridge and risk getting a virus that might kill them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Went grocery shopping today. Found it impossible not to put my fingers in my mouth when trying to open the plastic bags for fruit and produce. Touching all kinds of surfaces that probably are infected. The place had a Thanksgiving-like feel to it. Could just be a Friday thing in late winter. I've been stocking up on canned goods. I buy about twice as much as I need every week. Also noted there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/06/plentyOfToiletPaperInHannafords.png&quot;&gt;plenty of toilet paper&lt;/a&gt; on the shelves. Apparently people here aren't so scared of running out. The only thing that was in short supply was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/home&quot;&gt;Bread Alone&lt;/a&gt; bread, for some reason. I should've asked. It looks like they're not going to carry it in the future? That would be not good.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1235645351668764673&quot;&gt;Asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: I have a Mac and an iPhone. What's the best way to get a text file from my Mac onto my iPhone. Best == least work. Lots of answers. The thing I like about email the best is that the same approach works from a browser-based app like &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. I can add email capabilities there so I can make a list in the outliner and email it to my phone. That will be beautiful.</description>

			<description>We will look back at March 2020 as the good old days when the virus was more or less contained. Will we ever get back to this level again of containment?

			<title>Non-disclosure agreements</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was CEO of a small Silicon Valley company in the 1980s. Even back then, lawyers were advising companies to settle with employees who made claims, even when the company had done nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's why. Lawyers are expensive, as are trials, and some employees make a business of suing their employers, knowing that they will settle instead of contesting the claim because it's far less expensive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We only had one such claim, for age discrimination. I forget how much we paid, but it was a lot for a company our size. And it came with a mutual NDA. It wasn't to keep the employee from talking, it was to keep the company silent, because &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; were the ones who were harmed. After the suit was over and settled, I realized then why none of his references were willing to talk about him. He was going through the Valley, to companies who were hungry for skilled programmers, and willing to take a chance, with or without references. No doubt we weren't the last company to pay him off and accept an NDA. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, even if there is no NDA, the laws in California and New York heavily favor the employee. So the company isn't likely to say much about a former employee it had differences with, because it could very easily turn into an expensive lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just want to say NDAs are not nearly as simple as candidate Elizabeth Warren made them sound in the debates. I know from experience and I am not a lawyer, she is, and I'm sure she knows all about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/156&quot;&gt;list of things you should try&lt;/a&gt;.

It's klunky and whatever, but I get ideas when I write there, and I don't lose them. That's all I want from an idea processor. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1235235567245373445&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I just wrote. Figured a bunch of stuff out. I don't care if everyone can see it.</description>

			<title>What happened last night, part 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was a big deal in American politics. You know &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-beat-expectations-on-super-tuesday/&quot;&gt;the news&lt;/a&gt;. Biden scored big, at the expense of Sanders. Beyond that everything else is subject to opinion and polling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the evening I wrote: &quot;I honestly don't think people want Biden, I think they really &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want Sanders.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raines.com/&quot;&gt;Raines Cohen&lt;/a&gt; asked: &quot;If that were the case, why not Warren?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Before I answer, a couple of things about Raines. I've known him for a very long time, since I met him in Mitch Kapor's office in Cambridge in 1979. His father was Mitch's lawyer. I think Raines was all of 13 years old then. I was 25. Second, he's a friend, and I trust him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I gave him an honest answer, what I really think is true. With Warren fans I find you have to tiptoe around their certainty that anyone who says anything negative about her is a misogynist, or &quot;a person who dislikes, despises or is strongly prejudiced against women.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think Warren and Sanders are similar, but not on policy, on the way they approach the electorate, and I think to the extent they are rejected, it's for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I saw a meanness in Warren that I didnâ€™t like. A good president tries to draw everyone in, make everyone feel welcome. Neither her or Sanders has that impulse, like Trump.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Look at how people talk about her on the net â€” if you donâ€™t support her youâ€™re a misogynist. If you donâ€™t support Sanders, youâ€™re The Establishment. That excuses both of them from trying to understand who they arenâ€™t reaching. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If Iâ€™m their enemy, their scapegoat, Iâ€™m not voting for them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think theyâ€™re both smart enough to know this especially Warren. That makes them dangerous. The president of the United States must be a consensus builder. Not someone who could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose a single supporter. Warren created a wedge, based on gender, intentional or not. Men bad, women good. With predictable results, imho. It's a turnoff because we need to come together, and smart voters know this. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People who do &quot;turnout math&quot; miss this point. It isn't just getting people to the polls to vote for you, it's getting the country to see itself as one thing, not warring factions. These Democrats, Sanders and Warren, are doing what Trump did. Dividing. Wedging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Their policies aren't new, they're standard Democratic policies. Any Democrat would pursue those goals if we demand they do. The power is ours, as long as we stick together. Democrats who try to drive us apart are no better than Republicans who do that.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Ezra Klein said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21164091/sanders-biden-super-tuesday-endorsements-primary-2020&quot;&gt;same thing&lt;/a&gt; in a different way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>After many attempts, I'm now rolling on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Expanse&lt;/a&gt;. In the middle of season 2, I more or less understand who the characters are and the plot. I don't know why it took so many tries to get it. &lt;span class=&quot;spSpoiler&quot;&gt;I am sure that Julie Mao and Miller are melding into some kind of incredible love monster whose body is the planet of Venus. I also think their meeting was the sexiest thing I've seen on TV ever&lt;/span&gt;.</description>

			<description>Democrats have one goal. Trump out in a landslide. All the insiders talk about turnout, but you know what, that's up to us, the voters. I think that's the message of tonight. If he wins, Biden has been drafted to be our representative. We should organize &lt;i&gt;ourselves&lt;/i&gt; so we can't be ignored after the election.</description>

			<title>My father apologized</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something really weird happened in a dream last night.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My father apologized for something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's been dead since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He never apologized for anything to anyone as far as I recall, certainly not to me. He said and did plenty he should have apologized for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think in a weird way this is my subconscious telling me that it's ready to forgive him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the dream I felt so safe and secure in the moment, I said genuinely, don't worry about it, we can fix the problem right now. Then we went to the post office and I mailed a package to someone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A few years ago I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/08/theWorldIsSocialistPartIi.html&quot;&gt;Health care is socialist&lt;/a&gt;, about health insurance. But I didn't consider this. If there's a lethal virus going around, and we want to slow it down, we need to know where it is. That's the first thing. We have to test lots of people as they are in South Korea. I suppose we could require that people pay for their own tests, but that's just a tax. We might as well simplify the accounting and pay for the testing with tax dollars. It's the same thing. So when Repubs say it would be bad to make health care socialist, they're tricking you. It already is socialist. They just want to siphon off a fat chunk of the health care money for themselves, for doing nothing.</description>
