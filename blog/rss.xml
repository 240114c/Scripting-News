			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/whyTheNewCommentsAreSoGood.m4a&quot;&gt;18-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt; about why the new comments are so good. Two main reasons. 1. It's inverted from a spam point of view. You comment in your Twitter flow. I get to read your comment because I follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/comments/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/scriptingnews&quot;&gt;#scriptingnews&lt;/a&gt; tag. If I think what you said is valuable I can &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; it, or RT it or follow you. So there's a way for me to amplify your flow, but it's my choice. 2. Twitter's new 280-char limit works really well, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/31/155551.html&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; earlier. It's enough to express an idea, but not enough to write a blog post. Perfect.</description>

			<description>iTunes has been acting like an asshole today, refusing to copy files onto my iPhone. Had an idea. Can Dropbox on my iPhone play MP3s? It can. It's a way to avoid using iTunes to put podcasts on my iPhone. And they end up on all my devices.</description>

			<title>Comments on comments</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reminder to myself and others who read this blog. Use the &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-retweet&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; feature here on Scripting News more. It's a way to comment on what's going on here, without using Disqus (which in its latest iterations has become really offensive).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, with its 280 character limit is now a good commenting system wrt my &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Comment Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Keep it short, provide a link, don't use comments to write blog posts.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's funny, I didn't write much about the comments feature when it came out on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/16.html&quot;&gt;12/16&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/17.html&quot;&gt;subsequent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/18.html&quot;&gt;days&lt;/a&gt;. I did start a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/106&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the repo, but there isn't much there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Comments are &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+comments&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;much-discussed&lt;/a&gt; over the years on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also there's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/comments/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for comments. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Kernelizing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/29.html#a175206&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that Frontier's object database has a unique feature that makes programming persistent data easier than in other environments. This is because the database and interpreter are integrated, they were built at the same time to be part of the same environment. I reasoned that if data persisted automatically it would make programming easier.     &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the same insight that made blogging possible. Prior to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt;, websites had a content model where the pages you authored existed in two places, where you edit them and where they are published. By forcing there to be only one view, editing became vastly simpler. Same with data inside an app. If the data exists in one form outside the app and has to be &quot;brought in&quot; you then have to manage the movement, and keep a model for both places in your head at the same time. If you could push the movement down into the OS, it could of course store the data in a different form from the internal represenation, but that's hidden from the programmer. It's a virtual machine concept or as Ted Nelson calls it a &quot;virtuality.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This idea comes up all over the place. If you can push a function down into the lower level of the stack, abstracting it, you can simplify programming and create more reliable systems that require fewer programmers to build and maintain them. We called this process &quot;kernelizing&quot; at UserLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned all this on Twitter, of course it was pointed out that it sounds like something else someone else once did. I always wonder when I hear this if it's true. We don't have a simple enough language for explaining our innovations so that people who speak different languages can understand them. In music, everyone plays the piano, in science everyone speaks English and the language of math is standardized and universal. But there is no such standardization in software technology, though there could. I hoped that JavaScript would turn out to be that standard, but it's changing so much now that I have trouble understanding other people's code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think we did a lot of things in Frontier that people can benefit from, but not if we fail to communicate how they work. People who worked in Frontier know, but the problem is how to explain the ideas to people who don't. Wes Felter suggested that I do videos to explain this. I'd like to. But I hardly know where to start. If you are a Frontier-knowledgeable person, please feel free to go first. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>As I get deeper into SQL databases, I can explain the innovations of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/manual/chapter06.html&quot;&gt;Frontier's object database&lt;/a&gt; in new ways. For example, with SQL, the way you access structures in memory is dramatically different from how you access structures in the database. In Frontier, there is no difference. You use the same operators no matter where the data resides. The system manages the caching of data transparently. As far as I know, no other enviroment does this.</description>

			<description>An interesting idea? A community project to build a social graph of people who knew/worked with each other in the early days of tech. It could be an interesting way to get the gangs back together &quot;one more time.&quot; I wonder what the people who were at Personal Software would do with this idea. 1980s Apple people and developers. People who wrote for Wired in the early days. People who were at the first O'Reilly open source conference. The Silicon Valley Asshole Society. The first 100 bloggers, first 100 podcasters. People who worked at General Magic, Macromind and Marimba. People who went to Fred and Sylvia's cybersalons. Original subscribers of DaveNet. People who know NakedJen. People who were at the various BloggerCons. People who demo'd at the first Demo. Berkman Center alumni. Initial sponsors of the EFF.  I would &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; to participate in this project.</description>

			<description>You may hate Facebook but at least they publish whatever I write. I've only once had an item banned from FB and it was comedic, not tragic. Contrast this to the NYT that offers very little opportunity for me to get an idea through to other users of the NYT. Yes I do think this is a valid comparison.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever wonder, while watching a nature documentary, what it must feel like to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/koopa_kinte/status/1078875929437450241&quot;&gt;prey&lt;/a&gt; who's being eaten while they're still alive? Do you think they feel pain? Perhaps they feel an overwhelming sense of purpose, well-being. To know that they're being of use? It's hard to know. But I think that's where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2018/12/22/hes-jailed-life-after-murdering-his-wife-kids-so-why-do-women-send-him-love-letters/?fbclid=IwAR3mLXP66MoEtDCX_YuU3ocToF2bqWE0KhJHPNHGyoxMtftf_28Eng3uO1c&amp;utm_term=.2782a0c79042&quot;&gt;this impulse&lt;/a&gt; originates. We all know at some point we will be overwhelmed and dragged under, we'll die. And I'm guessing it isn't an entirely unpleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Now that the hype about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/11/131151.html&quot;&gt;The Correspondent&lt;/a&gt; has died down, thankfully, re-focus on the problem that Medium presents for the news industry. This morning I almost pointed to two on-topic (for me) pieces on Medium. I didn't do it, because every time I do, it creates a burden for all of us to overcome down the road. Think about the irony that TheC, a publishing company, posted their corporate statements during the rollout on Medium. What happens when they open their service for real? Will they publish their stories there too? Medium has something other news orgs don't (and they are a news org, by any reasonable definition) -- deep pockets. Evan Williams has billions he can keep it floating with. He has a long time to figure out how to make it work economically. TheC has $2.5 million. Every news org and blogger has a problem with Medium, whether they realize it or not. The more it is assumed that significant writing appears there, the harder it will be to publish elsewhere.</description>

			<description>If you accept the premise that Medium is a news org, consider that they're the only one who creates a somewhat level playing field for paid and non-paid writers. In other words, imho, they're doing exactly what TheC (and many others) should be doing and aren't. They probably don't see Medium as competition. If so, that is wrong, they very much are. The economics of news doesn't follow the same rules it did in the print era. We need to lower the gates and let more people in. The challenge then becomes deciding who are following ethical guidelines required to be considered news, or the different rules that apply to op-ed writers. There's a lot of brainpower that's going to waste. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://climate.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119&quot;&gt;so big&lt;/a&gt;, and the capabilities of the professionals so limited, that it's suicide to not try to tap the big resource that's out there, ready to be used. Medium is the only one who's doing it.</description>

			<description>The danger of Medium is two-fold. Without competition, and right now they don't have any, we're right back where we were before the web, only it's worse. And they haven't made any comittment to keeping their archive accessible, nor do they give people the ability to move their content off Medium without breaking links. Even though they have deep pockets, they could fail to find a business model, and shut down, leaving a huge hole in the web, over many years. You could see we crossed a dangerous line when our political leaders, including the president, were putting things on the record on Medium. Centralization is not good, esp centralization without a long-term economic model. And the cost of hosting text documents is so low that it's ridiculous for the rest of us to cede so much power to one company, yet we're doing it. It's a case study in why it's wrong to blame Facebook for what's wrong with their system, we're doing it again with Medium.</description>

Here he is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/12/27/proudMamaEveWithInfantPeterAndUncleDaveyExpressingConcern.png&quot;&gt;pictured&lt;/a&gt; shortly after birth on this day in 1958. I'm the little dude on his right who's freaking out. I've had that look on my face pretty much ever since. We're all that's left of the clan &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/12/27/evesFamilyInRockaway.png&quot;&gt;pictured here&lt;/a&gt;, taken in 1961 or 1962.

			<title>Testing date equality in JS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsfiddle.net/ha9g2w5j/&quot;&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; that testing two dates for equality in JavaScript does not work as a reasonable person might expect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var d1 = new Date (&quot;March 12, 1994&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var d2 = new Date (&quot;March 12, 1994&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;alert (d1 == d2);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The answer in the alert is false.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When everyone agrees on something, and users benefit from the agreement, then seriously consider maintaining the standard, even if your product would be, in some ways, nicer if you broke with the standard. Apple could have continued to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/i-still-miss-the-headphone-port/&quot;&gt;headphone jack&lt;/a&gt; on their phones, and all the other phone makers would have kept theirs. I'd still use my Bluetooth headphones (I was a wireless fan long before the headphone jack disappeared). It's the same reason we should all support &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt; for as long as humanly possible (i.e. forever). This is a big philosophical question for all tech developers.

			<description>I had no way of knowing how well the two shows I've been bingeing fit together. They are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70260350&quot;&gt;River&lt;/a&gt;, which is the story of a crazy grieving brilliant cop who learns to accept his insanity, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sho.com/kidding&quot;&gt;Kidding&lt;/a&gt;, a crazy grieving Mr Rogers type TV actor. They're both struggling with pretty much the same issue. What were the chances. And both are quite good, if you're looking for a time-consuming holiday binge.</description>

			<description>After four years of running Node apps on Linux servers, I have concluded that it could use an OS just for Node. A layer on top of Linux that watched the resources the apps were using and helped you better manage them. It's just a thought at this point.</description>

			<description>Now that I can monitor disk space usage in my ServerMonitor app, I'm getting a better idea of where the problems are. One of the big ones I just discovered is the Dropbox cache. On one of my servers 1/2 of the disk space was used by the cache! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/help/desktop-web/cache-folder&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; say the cache is cleared every three days, but this clearly isn't working on at least one of my systems. According to the docs you can just remove the contents of the &lt;i&gt;~/Dropbox/.dropbox.cache/&lt;/i&gt; folder.</description>

			<title>How I got a bad rep with AWS?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, in 2010, I was selling my house in Berkeley while living in NYC. On the weekend I had to move out, I had two days to get everything done and then drive back to NY, my main server on EC2 went down. Just died. So I quickly (the movers were arriving) redirected to another server and wrote a post asking if anyone reading my blog had a clue what the problem might be. It never occurred to me that it would be escalated to a problem inside Amazon, that they would treat my post as an urgent request for support. I was asking readers of my blog, many of whom use AWS, if they had any ideas that I could quickly look at that might help me find the problem. This is something I have always done here, today I call them &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+braintrust+query&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;braintrust queries&lt;/a&gt;. My readers are smart, generous, know their stuff, and love to show off. I take advantage of that, and am always sure to publicly post the results so it becomes part of the knowledge base of the open web.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got a call from an engineer at Amazon as a dozen people were working in the house I was turning over in a few hours, loading up stuff, asking for help, etc. The call couldn't have come at a worse time. I explained I couldn't talk, and said goodbye. The guy at the other end sounded surprised and miffed. I imagine in his mind he was doing me a huge favor (he was) and somehow I couldn't stop everything to get the (unexpected) help. At the same time I felt unworthy of the support, yet unable to accept it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, when I finally did find the problem, it was a server log overflowing, getting so large the software just thrashed, it couldn't complete a request. It wasn't Amazon software. As soon as I emptied the log, the server returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm often working on stuff that makes their system better. If this is the reason we don't communicate, what a misunderstanding and what a missed opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just re-read the recent NYT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about Facebook and I couldn't find anything in the piece that wasn't a conclusion and stated in a way that left it unclear what actual permissions were given to Facebook's partner companies. They need to hire experts at the Times to at least provide parallel reporting so their claims can be evaluated by neutral experts at the same time they make the allegations. Someone must watch over the NYT the way they watch over Trump and Facebook.</description>

			<description>The NYT is fucked up. Don't delete Facebook. They are as wrong as they were when they made an issue of Hillary's emails. That got us President Fucking Trump. Thank you very much NY Times. Instead let's &lt;i&gt;slowly&lt;/i&gt; figure out ways to do stuff on the open web that doesn't depend on huge tech companies. Facebook is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1075732207317196800&quot;&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; from our only problem. Change won't happen overnight and deleting Facebook is not the answer any more than we can solve climate change by deleting our cars. And btw, the NYT's mortal enemy is Facebook. At some point they should disclaim that, their readers should be made aware that they are scared shitless of what Facebook is doing to the journalism industry. That's a fear you and I, their reader, might not share with them.</description>

			<title>How to get videos off an iPhone</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Capture&quot;&gt;Image Capture&lt;/a&gt; app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Plug your iPhone into the Mac using the USB cable.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Unlock the phone if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The photos and videos should appear in a window.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Select the ones you want.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click the Import button.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open the Pictures folder.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The videos are in the folder. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Move them where ever you like.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do not use the Photos app. They store the videos you download in a database. You can find them if you persist but they're in a database and you can't just copy them out. This is pointless if you want to share them with other people or publish them via YouTube or whatever.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Car for a big guy?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1075541500027650048&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/862996047241135?notif_id=1545264878217485&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; I asked for advice about cars.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am quite tall. Esp in the torso. So itâ€™s hard for me to find a car I fit into. My head is usually crammed against the roof. Poor me. Okay Iâ€™m going to buy a car soon, and would like it to have ample headroom. Any ideas?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots of great advice came back which I will summarize here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Subaru, specifically the Forrester. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Toyota Rav4.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;VW Golf and Jetta.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Kia Soul (I rented one of these a few months ago, loved it. Lots of room and it's fun to drive.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Honda Pilot.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mazda CX-5.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Honda Element, but they no longer make them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hyundai Sonata.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Chevy Impala.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Toyota Highlander.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ford C-MAX.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Honda Accord.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Denali.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BMW i3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Scion XB.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Kia Niro.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tesla 3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Chrysler 300.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;VW Beetle.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nissan Maxima.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dodge RAM 1500.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Volvo XC90.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And two great stories I got links to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.turo.com/insights/cars-fit-for-nba-players?fbclid=IwAR3W2OGgZygigckC_SoP41yAv6DIpvr67UiP7OlVKFoo0o1PkXDVl3O03vo&quot;&gt;Cars fit for NBA players&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.fortune.com/2010/12/10/autos/honda_element_rip.fortune/index.htm?fbclid=IwAR0yTYSDGmoJhA06VLq48slyG4qMaXiiTzLXQ1S1HVVDupzb1FG3FUDGY1k&quot;&gt;Say goodbye to the Honda Element&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Uncle Davey's remedy for all your end-of-year Facebook woes. New rule requires Facebook to peer with the open web so people who are not on Facebook can communicate with people who are. All or nothing is the real problem. Lots of precedent. AT&amp;T had a monopoly over phones for a long time. If you wanted to make phone calls you had to use one of their devices. That rule changed and the rest is history. The technology is easy. There are plenty of people at Facebook who want to do it.</description>

Not all corruption is about money. Journalism exterts control and influence. Gatekeeping. They keep lots of ideas out of the news, esp ones they find uncomfortable. Show me an op-ed in the NYT about the future of journalism that says they should compete with Facebook. Or a public editor who is a member of the public? Also any industry that feels they should be above examination, and has been exempt for so long, must be &lt;i&gt;filled&lt;/i&gt; with corruption. And of course if there's no corruption, there's no harm in looking, right?</description>

			<description>I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dabeard&quot;&gt;David Beard&lt;/a&gt; at a future-of-journalism &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsgeist.org/exploring-future-news/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix last year, and spent a couple of hours talking with him at the Phoenix airport waiting for planes home to Boston and NYC, respectively. Since then I've been watching what he does on Twitter with awe and interest. He posts links to stories with comments that are very widely circulated. Some of his tweets get thousands of RTs. You might think he has a million followers, but he doesn't, just 47K, though it seems to be increasing quickly. I always wonder what his secret is, and what his goal is. By asking the question on my blog, I hope to provoke a public response. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/8&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the XML-RPC site about servers. How should they handle booleans. After almost 20 years since it first deployed, I have a practical answer. I also have a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/xmlrpc.js&quot;&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt;, in JavaScript, that can still be changed.</description>

			<description>The thing that I like about Facebook is that it theoretically gives me equal voice to Walt Mossberg. And to his credit, he often read things I wrote on Facebook. OTOH, when he quits FB it merits an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/walt-mossberg-quit-facebook.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT. So he lives in a different media world than the rest of us.</description>
