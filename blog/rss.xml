			<title>Media idea: Covid weather report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;MSNBC and CNN -- start a Covid weather report, nightly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A big &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_map&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; of the country with a weatherman style reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki&quot;&gt;Steve Kornacki&lt;/a&gt; would be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Show us where the outbreaks are and how things are changing and what they're doing to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tell us how the information-gathering is improving. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Could satellites help?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Re-frame the discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>More science in the news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Petitions don't work for politics, but they may work for media. If I started a petition to ask CNN and MSNBC to limit Trump coverage to 1 hour per night, would you sign it? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think MSNBC and CNN should stop focusing on Trump so much. There's so much news that we need to know. Wouldn't it be better to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Laurie_Garrett&quot;&gt;Laurie Garrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; on every night? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If science and medicine are so important, why not more science and medicine on TV. I've started watching CNN more because they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Gupta&quot;&gt;Sanjay Gupta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes we know Trump screwed up in the first part of 2020, but he's still screwing up. What should we do now? I know testing, testing, testing, but that's like saying baseball, baseball, baseball. The way we test, what we test for, that's something people should learn about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Coverage of the outbreaks should be like weather reporting. The more we know, and the more we see progress being made, the more hope can take over from fatalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see journalism as starting to separate from Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I predict that on the day he resigns in disgrace it will not be the #1 story of the day. Probably won't even be #2. That gives an idea of how much we have to change the focus to news that really matters not the latest fake controversy Trump offers us to distract from our future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was going to write a bit about Kobol vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/wheres-my-check-cobol-unemployment-and-taxes/&quot;&gt;COBOL&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient programming language which is in the news these days. Kobol is the homeworld of the Twelve Colonies in Battlestar Galactica. I've watched the full series twice. But the synopsis on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; is riveting. I often forget how simple and beautiful the overall structure of the plot is. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/21/bsgplot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spSpoiler&quot;&gt;BSG plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And of course the execution. I'd have to say, even though it has cheezy sets and special effects, it's pretty much a perfect multi-part scifi drama. I just watched The Expanse, which is also good, but BSG is still tops with me.</description>

			<description>I took a survey class in programming languages in grad school, and COBOL was of course one of them. It was in the mid-late 70s when people were still creating new systems in COBOL. It was one of the first attempts to make programming like English instead of like programming, so managers could do it, you wouldn't need programmers. To anyone who really knew about programming, it was obvious that this would not work. People would want features for which there were no human language equivalents, like looping and recursion, nesting, local variables, procedures, closures, objects, async, etc etc. We keep discovering new concepts for which you can't say &quot;this is just like..&quot; COBOL may have been the first programming language to reject programming, but it was not the last. Later attempts include Hypercard and AppleScript. I'm sure there were many others. I've always been most comfortable with Algol-like languages, C, Pascal, JavaScript. My own invented language, UserTalk, is Algol-like. There is a grammar somewhere for UserTalk. I'll find it later. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>The ebb and flow of lockdown</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The way we're going to fight the virus is like levels in video games. You don't get to move on to the next level until you've mastered the previous. And when you fall down, you go back to the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This narrative comes from listening to expert explainers on MSNBC last night, mainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/the-pandemics-path/&quot;&gt;Laurie Garrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;, who was also yesterday's guest on the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;Daily&lt;/a&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, establish strategic testing. Do statistical sampling to form virus outbreak &quot;weather reports,&quot; like tracking tornados. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you are in an area where there aren't active outbreaks, you can do a covid-aware resumption of business. Strict limits on size and density of gatherings, so new outbreaks, which will happen, are limited. Makes contact tracing possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Where there are outbreaks, do intense contact tracing. Full lockdown except for essential services. Locate people who are infected, and isolate with other spreaders, not with their families.

This is similar to what they do at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/politics/&quot;&gt;538&lt;/a&gt; to predict election outcomes. It's also similar to what they do with TV program ratings for advertising, and gathering meteorological data to support weather forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's like the mass shootings. They only count those who were killed. But some people are so damaged they never get to resume anything like a normal life.

Last night I watched the first episode of season 5 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amc.com/shows/better-call-saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;One year ago today I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/20/151133.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Those who say impeach is not the answer, what would Trump have to do in order to make impeach the right answer?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Well here's the thing, what makes you think he won't do much worse between now and inauguration day in 2021?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He wouldn't have any restraints between now and then.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And BTW, what constraints would there be on the next president? Maybe not such a buffoon as Trump. If we don't impeach and remove, we no longer have a Constitution that's enforced re the president. This guy has been ignoring it. We would all be ignoring it if he isn't impeached and removed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A couple of nights ago I dreamed I was still a smoker, and felt guilty about lying to everyone that I had stopped. In the dream I'm going from store to store looking for my brand. It's so weird, I quit 6519 days ago. Not one cigarette in all that time. So why in my subconscious do I feel like a loser for cheating?</description>

			<title>Is the virus here?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I find it helpful to ask the question &quot;Is the virus here?&quot; I thought on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/08.html&quot;&gt;March 8&lt;/a&gt; it must not be here yet. I had a dinner party that night. Lots of touching, no social distancing. Some people from the small town I live in, some from NYC. Should have been more careful. But it's now 41 days later, and all the guests at the party are well. So I guess we dodged a bullet. On that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, when I go for a walk, or go to the market, I ask the same question and assume the answer is yes. The virus is here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How do I keep it out of my lungs?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In server programming there's this idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking&quot;&gt;tainted text&lt;/a&gt;. If it came from outside the server, it could contain executable code. That's how hackers get into our systems, through tainted text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I think about packages from Amazon the same way. I have a physical-world untaint function. I leave them alone for 24 hours. I've heard that the virus will die on cardboard in 24 hours. I assume whatever is inside the box is not dirty, but I think of it as tainted too. It came from outside. It's tainted. I wash my hands after handling it. Then at some point I shrug my shoulders and bless it as part of the house, and not tainted. It's how I maintain a level of sanity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/reference/manila/macros/safeMacrosGuidelines&quot;&gt;excellent guide&lt;/a&gt; to being safe with macros in Frontier, many years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find a lot of parallels between programming and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology&quot;&gt;epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;. We've been dealing with similar concerns ever since our software started communicating over the open network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I understand we're at risk of losing journalism. I propose something grand, like what we're doing with the economy. Merge all the different news orgs in America, like the states are linking up at governor level, and then put your heads together and stop doing stuff that makes the problems worse, and get busy with the new reality. Stop duplicating efforts, chasing gotchas, going through the loops with Trump, and making users give each of you their information just to give you money. Reduce friction, build a new journalism we can all be proud of.</description>

			<title>I wish the Democrats would use the fucking tools</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A service the Democrats should run, now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A daily advisory saying which government edicts you should not obey to protect your life and other's lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, there must be Democrats in Jacksonville who do not know going to the beach is not safe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tell them. Save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each time I think the Dems are establishing a persistent online channel via social media, e.g. Howard Dean in 2004, Obama in 2008 and 2012, the Clinton campaign in 2016, Bloomberg this year, even Warren, as soon as the campaign is over the freaking channel closes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is as stupid as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That channel should NEVER close. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not only is it bad marketing, it's also dangerous policy. Remember Dems you're running for a reason -- to govern. To be good at it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well even if you aren't president, we still need leadership, esp in times of a void in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Glitch, day 4</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay so I decided what my next step would be in my exploration of Glitch, get &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; running there. And I did, and it took about five minutes. I keep trying to get Glitch to put up some resistance, but it doesn't. It really does run Node code, unmodified. When I get it working so quickly I'm dazed and need to retreat a bit and think some more as if I had hit obstacle after obstacle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the server: &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;pagepark.glitch.me&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just put a random OPML file there, and it just worked, as it should.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I lied. I did have to make a small mod. After reading the config.json file, I had to add a check to see if process.env.PORT was defined, and if so use that port, instead of the default port. That's how Glitch tells you what port to run on, same way Heroku does. I will add that to the PagePark distribution so it'll run without mods.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so now I know what I want to do next. Find out if they have an API so I can use my own editor to write for this site. And all of a sudden I will have something useful that is shareable. Not bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So do they have an API? That's the next thing to look into.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I wonder if there's a way to have it load from the GitHub repo automatically?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168#issuecomment-615894200&quot;&gt;thread on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with this new info. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If they were going to choose a special Time person of the year, I'd nominate The Governor. We're depending on them, given who the president is, and they appear to be coming through, setting an incredible example by working together against the odds and against the norms of the last 30 years.</description>

			<description>I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1251089277620019200&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; early this morning asking people to pick one of four women as Biden's running mate. They were Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitmer, Elizabeth Warren and Stacey Abrams, in that order. Not surprisingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer&quot;&gt;Whitmer&lt;/a&gt; is getting the fewest votes, but I think she's the best choice. Midwestern governor. Very composed, take-charge person, but also compassionate. Young but not too young. She's under incredible pressure, and apparently doing well. Maybe I like her so much because I don't know much about her. It's possible. But it's her moment now, and there's something to be said for pulling the in-the-moment energy into the campaign. He can't choose &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; because of his pledge, but Whitmer might be even better. Now could she campaign and deal with the problems of Michigan, which are substantial. That might be a very good way to campaign, actually. And she seems to pass the most important test -- she would be a good chief executive for the country if she is needed for that.</description>

			<title>Glitch, day 3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay it took a lot of hacking, discomfort, trial and error and confusion, because the Glitch model is so different from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; I'm used to, but I did finally get a simple editor app running on a Glitch server. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://macwrite.org/glitch/&quot;&gt;variant&lt;/a&gt; of MacWrite. Hooks up to an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodeStorage&lt;/a&gt; running on the Glitch server, which in turn connects to Twitter for identity, and it stores the files in the folder Glitch gives me. This is not meant to be something useful, just a testbed to learn with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shot: Simple text editor running on Glitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've had trouble with is knowing when it's running what version of my app because they appear to relaunch it on every editing change. I understand they do this for newbie programmers, so it's something they don't have to learn to get to Hello World. I might do it that way. But as a programmer for many years, I would like to control that. Ideally from the terminal. Run the app the way I do on my Linux server. &lt;code&gt;node appname.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A little prior art, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal&quot;&gt;Turbo Pascal&lt;/a&gt; was very explicit in when you ran what version of the app. You had to stop the app manually, and then restart it after a change. I was already a professional programmer at the time, so I can't vouch for how that worked for newbies, but a lot of people learned to program in TP, so it worked for some of them. In other words, not sure the way Glitch does it is even the right way to go for beginners. You want there to be as little magic as possible, imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure what my next experiment will be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thread on GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I went grocery shopping today. Took a couple of hours all-told. The supermarket was reconfigured with new protocols for moving through the aisles and waiting for checkout. Not too crowded, and almost everything I needed was there. Pasta is now the item in short supply. They had lots of cleaning products, I chose three, but they would only let me buy one. I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Freak-Cleaning-Multi-Surface-Starter/dp/B07PHL372F&quot;&gt;Clean Freak&lt;/a&gt; because I loved the concept and the name. Yes packaging and branding still matter, even in post-apocalypse America. The only bacon they had was maple-flavored. Never heard of such a thing. On coming home I fried some up, and now the whole house smells of maple syrup. Not a good thing imho. Also -- they had toilet paper. Everyone I saw got some.</description>

			<title>Signed up for Medicare</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just completed signing up for Medicare including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans&quot;&gt;Medicare Advantage Plan&lt;/a&gt;. My two cents. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XKoar34gBI&quot;&gt;Bernie says&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Medicare for All&quot; -- no I don't think so. It's a bastard child. Complicated and convoluted. Obviously something that has been fought over repeatedly in Congress. And in the end, after getting educated, and coming back again and again, I did what everyone seems to, shrug their shoulders, pick a plan and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The medical system should work like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You need health care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You get health care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That's it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Medicare isn't that. It's way better than I what I've had until now, ObamaCare, which was a vast improvement over what I had before that (I'd call it Maybe I'm Covered We'll Find Out When I Need It-care). It feels like graduating, finally I get treated like I matter, a little. And I'm pretty sure that if I get in deep shit medically I will be helped. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But why should you have to wait until you're 65 to get that?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm not 65 yet, but soon. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: It feels like that great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3XX_z5wZn0&quot;&gt;moment&lt;/a&gt; in Goodfellas where Paulie says to young Henry Hill &quot;You broke your cherry!&quot; Basically every moment in Goodfellas is a great moment, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Glitch, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Lots more info about running Glitch apps &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, so far the only big limit I've learned about with Glitch is the inability to map an IP address to an app. But this may not be a problem because I use Hover as my registrar and DNS, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html?title=theyCanMap&quot;&gt;they can map&lt;/a&gt; a top level domain using a CNAME. So you could say make mydomain.com point to a Glitch app.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
