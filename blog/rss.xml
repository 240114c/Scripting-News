It's so many levels underground that I take the D or B train from Columbus Circle to get there, instead of walking, because I don't like all the stairs.</description>

			<description>One thing would improve political discourse enormously. Remembering that it's possible, even common, for two things to be true at the same time, that intuitively you might not think could be true at the same time.</description>

			<description>I accepted an invitation to speak at a future-of-news conference. Like all other such conferences it's sponsored by at least one big &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;tech company&lt;/a&gt;. They get their name on the program, and presumably a booth in the hallway. Probably a session or two focused on their role in the future-of-news ecosystem. And they have a more insidious effect, their presence makes sure that speakers don't criticize them too much, because they're all hoping to get some of the money they've earmarked to support struggling news orgs. I am also the only non-professional speaker, the only blogger, the only user of news. My experience with these conferences is awful. People are polite enough when I speak, but nothing comes of it. I never get invited back. This morning I wonder why I accepted.</description>

			<description>Many years ago at a tech conference, either &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edge.org/documents/digerati/Alsop.html&quot;&gt;Stewart's&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson&quot;&gt;Esther's&lt;/a&gt;, I was seated at lunch next to the founder of a sneaker company that had either gone public or sold out leaving the founder very wealthy, in today's terms, he was probably worth billions of dollars. I had recently had my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_event&quot;&gt;liquidity event&lt;/a&gt;, so of course we were talking about money, and he volunteered that it was impossible to live for less than $20 million a year. I looked at him for a sign of irony or other form of humor but he appeared serious. I asked if he was serious, and he repeated the claim. I said, pointing to everyone at the table, &quot;Every one of these people is spending less than $20 million a year.&quot; He was not impressed. I pointed to the waiters and said they're not spending $20 million a year. Nothing could dislodge his belief. To this day I wonder if it was some form of performance art or is it possible that so much money could make someone so detached from normal people that they actually believe something like that.</description>

			<description>Over at Galley, which is a new community at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjr.org/&quot;&gt;CJR&lt;/a&gt;, they asked me what I thought Twitter could do to make things better. Of course I had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://galley.cjr.org/public/conversations/-LXLajqoXhQjUHg5EbAe&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; ready to go. BTW, this is what I've been talking about. Opening the door to your pub to non-journalists. Next step is to gather links to feeds people in the community read and join them together into a river. But this is an &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; first step.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2019/01/29/how-digital-media-killed-itself/&quot;&gt;Om explains&lt;/a&gt; how digital media killed itself. But we have yet to take the turn dictated by the web &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-arrow-right&quot; style=&quot;color: gray&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;create a hybrid pub that behaves both like the NYT and Facebook.&lt;/i&gt; A level playing field. Allow amateurs to compete with pros. Initially the home page is populated by the pros (much like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/moments&quot;&gt;Twitter is doing&lt;/a&gt;, Jack and company obviously gets this), with the occasional piece by an amateur. Since each act of journalism is just an amalgram of source quotes, we would try to draw the most authoritative sources into our network. Over time, learn what part of the editorial process must be paid, and what part will be done by amateurs, out of love, out of civic pride, and wanting to solve the vexing problems that our species faces. We've run out of time to dick around.</description>

			<description>Also, Om's idea of what digital media is is not the same as mine. I never needed clicks to justify my writing. I didn't get paid for it, so no one could lay me off. There's lots of digital media that has nothing to do with emulating news orgs that predate the web.</description>

			<description>To &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt;, who supports journalism as-is, but has also sounded the alarm that we have only &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/is-the-green-new-deal-for-real/&quot;&gt;12 years&lt;/a&gt; left to save the species. The journalism you support will spend most of the time betw now and Election Day 2020 covering the horse race. That's about 10% of the 12 years, wasted.</description>

I believe they should have competed, created a &lt;i&gt;news Facebook&lt;/i&gt; of their own, any one of them could, and until they offer the level playing field that tech offers, they can't get our help. There's actually a lot to this. I scratch the surface in this 15-minute rambling (sorry) podcast.</description>

If you have this sushi in front of you waiting to be eaten, you are the richest you can possibly be. It does not matter how much money you have in the bank. Or how long you will live. Or who likes you. You are about to eat the best meal possible. You can't be richer than that. BTW, the sushi is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sushiran.com/&quot;&gt;Sushi Ran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sushiran/@37.8583434,-122.4848849,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xeaae7b88a5c5d2ad!8m2!3d37.8586378!4d-122.485828&quot;&gt;Sausalito&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Today is my maternal grandfather's birthday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rudykiesler.com/&quot;&gt;Rudy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;. I don't remember what year he was born, perhaps 1908? But I will likely never forget the day he was born. I also remember my paternal grandfather's birthday -- May 1, 1899. One day before mine (in 1955). I don't remember my father's birthday, there was always confusion about it.

			<description>You know how Twitch lets you watch people program? I've never wanted to do that, it would make me too self-conscious, break the trance. Programming is a deeply meditative thing for me. Not something I'd want to do for an audience. But I realized after doing a project in GitHub from the beginning, that this is a much more meaningful kind of performance. You can watch the building go up over many programming sessions. Starting with the most basic stuff, to stress tests and docs. It's all there in the (still private) repo.</description>

			<title>Dave's howto for MySQL on Mac</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is how you start from scratch with MySQL on the Mac, assuming all you want is the same experience as what you have on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; and install the package from mysql.com. In the process you will choose a password for the root user.  This is important.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the Mac system settings app, there should be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/27/mySqlControlPanel.png&quot;&gt;new panel&lt;/a&gt; for MySQL. Open it and be sure MySQL is started. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In a new Terminal window: &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;cd /usr/local/mysql/bin&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;sudo mysql --password&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It will ask for two passwords, your Mac system password to authenticate as root, and the password you chose for MySql in the first step. Once you enter both correctly you'll be able to type SQL commands. From here it should behave just like Linux. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/108&quot;&gt;Scott Hanson&lt;/a&gt; for the outstanding support, as always.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another thing most people don't get. Developing platforms even before you roll them out, takes a lot of time. People think about platforms as if you could imagine a movie like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)&quot;&gt;Titanic&lt;/a&gt; one day, and have it in the theaters in a month or two. Platforms take time.</description>

			<description>On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/podcasts/the-daily/covington-nathan-phillips.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; Daily podcast they went through the confusion about the kids who appeared to be harassing the Native American veteran singing at the Lincoln Memorial. The lesson we keep learning is that you can't always tell what happened considering only one or two points of view. This is the mistake journalism keeps making, assuming there's a Democrat and Republican view and nothing else. They miss a lot of other points of view that matter, such as the view of their readers/viewers. We're not in DC, and we're not running for president, and we're not going to win or lose, but we still need info. Isn't that why you all do the news?? In the Wilbur Ross story they omitted important information. They wanted to make Ross look bad, but actually he was making a good point. Maybe run a piece for the furloughed employees listing their options, which I'm learning (through my tweet below, not through the news) are developing. A smaller point, but also important, sometimes people we don't like say things that are true and important.</description>

			<title>Idea: A paywall you can buy out</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hate paywalls. I pay to get through two of them, the NY Times and the Washington Post. If I were going to pay for others, I would certainly add New York Magazine, primarily for one columnist, Jonathan Chait, who writes a large number of (imho) must-read columns. Like the one he wrote today about the Republican way of hostage-taking, and how you just can't give into it. I remember very well how, during the Obama Administration, Mitch McConnell threatened to crash the economy if they didn't get unilateral concessions. Obama caved once, but the second time they tried it, he learned -- and gave absolutely no ground. That stopped the hostage-taking. But now they're at it again.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would like everyone to read that column but it's behind a paywall, so I'm reluctant to push the link. But this made me think of a slight variation on the paywall idea. How about this -- I read the Chait piece, and I think it's so important that I want everyone to read it. So I pledge $5 toward a specified buyout price, say $10K. It would be clearly stated, and you'd see how much further they have to go. If they never reach buyout, you pay nothing. But if it does, they take your money and the paywall comes down, for this article. Everyone can read it for free. Next time he writes a column, it gets a new countdown and perhaps a new price. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you get the benefit of a paywall, which most readers probably hate, and a way to make it come down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I hate paywalls. I pay to get through two of them, the NY Times and the Washington Post. If I were going to pay for others, I would certainly add New York Magazine, primarily for one columnist, Jonathan Chait, who writes a large number of (imho) must-read columns. Like the one he wrote today about the Republican way of hostage-taking, and how you just can't give into it. I remember very well how, during the Obama Administration, Mitch McConnell threatened to crash the economy if they didn't get unilateral concessions. Obama caved once, but the second time they tried it, he learned -- and gave absolutely no ground. That stopped the hostage-taking. But now they're at it again." created="Wed, 23 Jan 2019 19:42:41 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/23/drink.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/01/23/194216.html#a194241"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway, I would like everyone to read that column but it's behind a paywall, so I'm reluctant to push the link. But this made me think of a slight variation on the paywall idea. How about this -- I read the Chait piece, and I think it's so important that I want everyone to read it. So I pledge $5 toward a specified buyout price, say $10K. It would be clearly stated, and you'd see how much further they have to go. If they never reach buyout, you pay nothing. But if it does, they take your money and the paywall comes down, for this article. Everyone can read it for free.

			<title>Tweaks today</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I made a couple of tweaks today on the Scripting News home page.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The diaglog that confirms you want to connect to Twitter so you can Like items didn't work well on phones. Added a bit of CSS and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/23/iphoneDialog.png&quot;&gt;now it does&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I noticed that the background of text on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/20.html&quot;&gt;day archives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/11/195154.html&quot;&gt;story pages&lt;/a&gt; didn't match that on the home page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

The &quot;young people&quot; he's talking about is of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; who should keep doing &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what she's doing. So brilliant and clear-thinking and joyful. Exactly what we need now. And of course she has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1087077990989737986&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DLDConference/status/1086981645582983168&quot;&gt;At DLD&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tech conference in Munich, the week before Davos, Sheryl Sandberg asks What Kind of Internet Do We Want? Her company is suffocating the open web, so itâ€™s really not her question to ask. Imho, ultimately we'll think of the big tech companies the way we think of any powerful dominant industry. Imagine the CEO of Exxon on stage asking What Kind of Environment Do We Want? The pundits would say &quot;see there's nothing to worry about, Exxon wants the best for us.&quot; And of course they don't. Not their job.</description>

			<description>Also I see what she did there. Sandberg asks what kind of internet do &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; want. Hah. As if what we want has anything to do with it. They hire good PR consultants and speech writers at Facebook. The best. Remember, never automatically &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/09/08/hillaryGoToWestWingDebatePrepSchool.html&quot;&gt;accept the premise&lt;/a&gt; of a question.</description>

We need an &lt;a href=&quot;https://indivisible.org/&quot;&gt;Indivisible&lt;/a&gt; for journalism. Journalism should compete with tech, as distasteful as it may be for them to create a level playing field where all of us can report the news. Tech had the guts to give all of us an equal voice. Journalism must match that.</description>

			<title>My Flickr photos on scripting.com</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you recall, I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/12.html#a153036&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; for the archive of my photos. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/11/180256.html&quot;&gt;got&lt;/a&gt; most of them. Spent some time trying to understand the connection between the JSON bits and the JPEG bits. Finally found the correlation. Then I spent a day building a static site from all that info, and uploaded it to a folder on scripting.com, which is a bucket on Amazon S3. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The result is 5815 pages &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/flickr/00243.html&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like to hit the Random button and when I find something interesting, hit the prev button until I find the beginning of the sequence, and then hit the next button to go through them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also included a link to the Scripting News blog page for the day the photo was taken. Often you'll get an idea of the context, where I was, what I was doing, maybe even some comments on the picture itself. I tended to upload pictures to Flickr when I was traveling somewhere. To Amsterdam, New Orleans, driving cross country, going to a political convention, or a tech conference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Two podcasts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I took a longish walk this morning up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabar%27s&quot;&gt;Zabar's&lt;/a&gt; and back, and listened to two podcasts on the way, Friday's Daily and last week's Radio Open Source. The Daily was about the splintering of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/podcasts/the-daily/womens-march-anti-semitism.html&quot;&gt;Women's March&lt;/a&gt; along racial lines. They discussed the issues that the march stood for, all of them women's issues, but they didn't get my perspective, and I marched, so I feel I'm entitled to an opinion. I didn't mind that they called it the Women's March, but I felt it was a march by everyone who was opposed to Trump. I was unhappy when they didn't let people who are anti-abortion speak (I am pro-choice btw). And it was totally predictable, based on experience in the antiwar movement of the 60s and 70s,  that they would splinter and drift into irrelevance, taking our hopes of organizing against Trump with them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Radio Open Source episode was about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/is-the-green-new-deal-for-real/&quot;&gt;Green New Deal&lt;/a&gt; and our hero &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AOC&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt;. I am a huge fan of the podcast, and I have the same comment about this episode as I do about every one. What people want is meaning in their lives. That's why it's brilliant that AOC included the idea that any American can get a public service job helping America transition to the new energy system. Why is it so exciting? Because people want to make a difference, we all want our lives to mean something. Otherwise everything in the show was illuminating, as always, lots of new facts about solar and wind energy, and a general optimism which is what I enjoy most about the show.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
