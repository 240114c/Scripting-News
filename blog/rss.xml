			<description>Google, Apple, Facebook all know where people are moving around and where they’re locked down. People in pre-CV America would have freaked if they made the data public, in aggregate. Personally I’d love to see it.</description>

			<title>What viral means</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I heard someone parrot what the president said about how car accidents kill 65K people a year, yet we don't shut down the car industry. So why do we all have to hibernate in isolation while the scientists find a treatment or a vaccine for this killer disease, Covid-19. I suppose it's good to explain, one time, in one place, why a virus is different from a car accident, using Twitter as an example. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most things I post on Twitter are not viral. One or two people may RT it, and that's it. Once in a while I post something does go viral. That means a few people RT to people who then RT it to people who then RT it, etc. Sooner or later 100K people have seen my stupid little tweet. Covid-19 is like that. If you have it, and you don't isolate, you will give it to 3 other people, and they will give it to 3 more people, and so on. Very quickly a million people have it. It goes viral. I'm sure Trump has used that word perhaps without really understanding what it means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now why is that a problem? We'll answer that in the next lesson. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/profits-or-people/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; is worth a listen. The economics of Coronavirus. They breezed by a huge issue. Millions of Americans without health insurance, no savings, no job, sick, homeless, hungry, plus guns. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/21.html#a011845&quot;&gt;ticking time bomb&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about briefly on March 21. The so-called stimulus Congress passed, what a joke, does nothing to address this. I would much preferred see the $2 trillion give everyone the health care they need, keep us all fed, and reboot the economy around serving the people of the country. The UK did this, by guaranteeing 80% of people's salaries for the duration. They already have a national health care system. We are headed for a big crash. Congress didn't deal with it.</description>

			<description>I don't feel good about this. I was glad to hear Boris Johnson got the CV, not because I hold anything against him, but if he can get it so can Trump. And I think that would be good for Americans who are scared out of our minds about this disease esp because our president is not.</description>

			<description>I wonder how much more effective the lockdown would be if we all had good supplies of disinfectant. I have none. It's been two weeks. Why is there such a lag in producing hand sanitizers and wipes?</description>

			<description>Why America is so bad at Covid-19. It’s our attitude, there are never consequences for Americans. That’s for other people. We have wars and tax cuts at the same time. We don’t see the coffins of our returning dead. Nothing happens to us. We can’t imagine things not being normal. The generation that grew up during World War II, who experienced the Holocaust, the advent of nuclear weapons, that generation is gone now. Everyone alive today, not just boomers, have been spoiled. We're all coming awake now from a life-long trance. For the first time in our lives, we have to deal with the mortality of our country. Don't cry for America. It's time to grow up, again. Couldn't have a more perfect person as president. It's easy to see he is our past. Now how do we move beyond that.</description>

			<description>My parents were born in 1929 (father) and 1932 (mother), in Bucharest and Prague. They fled from the Nazis as children with their parents, to NYC. Their lives were formed in chaos.</description>

			<description>I always wondered &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1242438120580186113&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; bike delivery people in NYC put plastic bags over the handles of their bikes. Today I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polly/status/1242438758001258496&quot;&gt;found out&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;They keep your hands warm, particularly when you're biking really fast and the wind is bad. Can still access the gears and brakes this way, which you couldn't do easily in gloves.&quot;</description>

			<description>Went to a local supermarket this morning. It was empty of people. The shelves were pretty well stocked. I went because a friend told me there were paper products. I got four rolls of paper towels. And two packages of bacon (why not, who knows when we'll see it again).</description>

			<description>I watched the finale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)#Season_3&quot;&gt;season 3 &lt;/a&gt;of The Expanse without realizing it was the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_3_(2018)&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; before Amazon took it over. It was masterful. I'm going to have to watch it again. BTW, my favorite character is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8t4czs/drummerwhat_a_character/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. I am a Belter, for sure.</description>

			<description>People who make Skype should watch cable news. What's wrong? Why do so many of the remote experts look and sound so shitty. Come on you all can do better! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I read in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/phones-track-spread-covid19-good-idea/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about China and South Korea how they relied on location data from people's phones to know where contagious people had been. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/20.html#a141448&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; had to install one of these apps before they'd let her enter the country, just to switch planes. I'm guessing that in the US we can't use that data even though companies like Google, Apple and Facebook have it. The context has changed, and now trillions of dollars are at stake, the existence of our economy, our lives (hope that's not too dramatic). Perhaps it's time to re-think our assumptions.</description>
