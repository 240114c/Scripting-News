			<description>A browser JavaScript challenge. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/playingcards/&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt;. Use the up and down arrow keys to move from card to card. When you get to the bottom of the screen the cursor moves to an object that is not visible. I want to scroll the window vertically to make the cursor object fully visible. If you look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/playingcards/code.js&quot;&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see a routine named  &lt;i&gt;scrollToMakeVisible. &lt;/i&gt;The goal is to fill in the body of that routine. I've opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/116&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.</description>

			<description>I find GORKA! fascinating because of his utter depravity and smarminess and the fact that some people obviously feel he is educated and sophisticated. I like GORKA! even better when he is being humiliated &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/existentialfish/status/1125414269179310082&quot;&gt;to his face&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I tried cross-posting but it doesn't work. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/09/04/endingAnExperiment.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; it up. The problem is that the silos don't support cross-posting in any direction. They really want to be worlds unto themselves. The web, as far as they're concerned, isn't worth supporting, even though they couldn't exist without it.</description>

			<title>What pisses me off</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You know what pisses me off. A guy writing the best political blog out there, on Facebook. So after I read his piece and think &quot;everyone should see this&quot; I can't send the link outside of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have this incredible thing called the web and we don't use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same thing when a person I admire and who is doing great stuff to help keep the web open, writes her latest report on Medium, where it is already behind a paywall and will likely disappear the day Medium runs out of ideas how to monetize news.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Streaming in the kitchen</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I live in the country, in upstate NY, the only NPR station I get is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wamc.org/&quot;&gt;WAMC&lt;/a&gt;, which I'm not crazy about, primarily because there's this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_S._Chartock&quot;&gt;one guy&lt;/a&gt; who I think is obnoxious who seems to always be on. I'm thinking it might be time to get an Amazon Echo, even though I dislike the idea of bringing an always-on listening device into my home. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1125047788499275777&quot;&gt;item above&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter without enough background info. This is for the kitchen. Of course I already know about streaming stations available in a web browser. There's no place for a laptop on the kitchen counter, along with the toaster, coffee maker, microwave, etc. People have also recommeded Sonos, but they are doing the same thing as the Amazon Echo, they run the exact same software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I know what I have to do...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sangean-WR-2-AMWooden-Receiver-Walnut/dp/B0009ZAA4M&quot;&gt;Sangean WR-2&lt;/a&gt; radio I currently have, which I bought in 2007 for the house in Berkeley, is a lovely product. Not cheap. But I've used it almost every day since then. Listening to the radio in the morning is part of my daily ritual. I love that I've had it so long. But of course there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075313J1R/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1&quot;&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; that has all the features I want. The best one is simply that it supports Bluetooth and that means anything I can play on my iPhone that's always in my pocket I can play on the kitchen radio. It means however that I'll have to replace the radio I love so much. Oh well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a lot like replacing the 10-year-old Sony screen that I have with a new 4K screen. The quality is better, for sure, but the biggest reason to buy the newest version are all the new standards they support. Without that it remains an island, it can't connect to the other devices. In the last decade connectivity has gone from a promise to reality. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched a little MSNBC last night and don't like the way it's going. They're turning the crisis in DC into a horse race. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not Democrats vs Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the United States of America vs a gang of thugs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Don't make the Dem leadership responsible, we all did this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's time for the US to grow up. We've had it very very very easy. We fought two wars with no discomfort at home. We are fat and spoiled. This is not the Democrat's problem &lt;i&gt;it's all our problem.&lt;/i&gt; Including asshole moderators on TV and Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Lots of people were working on classified ads on the web in the 90s. I had my own project, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/ads/helpWanted.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; is still &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/suites/classAds.html&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. Journalists should stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/the-markup-craig-newmark-journalism?verso=true&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; Craig Newmark is responsible. Progress happens. The web is better at classified ads. That's the story.</description>

			<description>I've been taking pictures of my countryside explorations, and found that my top of the line &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_XS&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; isn't doing a good enough job, so I thought I'd try dusting off the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_5D&quot;&gt;Canon EOS 5D&lt;/a&gt; my father left me, and see what it can do. I went though some of the pictures, the quality is amazing, esp for a camera that's over ten years old. Here's a small bit of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/02/lafayetteStreet2011.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; I took on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bleecker+St+%26+Lafayette+St,+New+York,+NY+10012/@40.7259294,-73.9968293,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c259855fdd5293:0xd39ec45d9866811e!8m2!3d40.7259294!4d-73.9946406&quot;&gt;Lafayette St&lt;/a&gt; in NYC.

			<description>A longtime blogging friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danconover.com/&quot;&gt;Dan Conover&lt;/a&gt; is writing on Facebook these days, which is a shame, because his best pieces get me thinking enough that I want to write my own post that expands on his thinking, like the one he wrote the other day about splitting the US in two. Dan lives in South Carolina. Former journalist. I met him on my visit to Spartanberg in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/02/15.html&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a great auto tour through the south. I learned a lot at every stop. So Dan wrote that the problems of the US are much bigger than a terrible choice for president in 2016, it has to do with the compromise that was made at the beginning of the country when it was just 3 million people (today's population of Oklahoma) because they built a country around two very different economies and cultures -- agrarian and urban. It's only grown more pronounced in 2019. We just can't live together. The US needs a Brexit. Of course we aren't going to get one (it's impossible). I wish you could read his whole piece.</description>
