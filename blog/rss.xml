			<description>xkcd's &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/2030/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; for today is right on. I’m a software developer and I concur. We throw out our base technology every few years and start over, leaving the stuff that’s already deployed hard to evolve or fix, and the latest stuff full of bugs, and long before it’s mature and reliable we do it all over again.</description>

			<description>I commented in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1027177850754027521&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter on the controversy re the recent hire by the NYT editorial board and sweeping comments she made previously about white men. I am responding to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/8/8/17661368/sarah-jeong-twitter-new-york-times-andrew-sullivan&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Ezra Klein in Vox. I waited a few days for the furor to die down, and to try to say thoughtfuly and carefully how I as a man feel about such statements. Klein had said, for the first time I can recall for a reporter, how he feels about these things. I'll let the comments speak for themselves now.</description>

			<description>How can so many elections come down to a fraction of a percent of the vote? Doesn't probability say that this outcome is extremely unlikely? Why does it happen so often?</description>

			<description>The other day I spilled a bottle of water on my keyboard, and have been limping along waiting for a new keyboard to arrive. I am now using it. This time I decided not to opt for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DPF08E/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt; Apple keyboard, instead I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077926YZQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Macally keyboard&lt;/a&gt; which cost a fraction of what the Apple one did. So far it seems quite nice. My fingers need to set up in a different place, and the keyboard doesn't have lifters at the top to put it at an angle, but I'm already getting used to it. Unfortunately the modifier keys &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/08/kbControlPanel.png&quot;&gt;control panel&lt;/a&gt; isn't working, not sure why. Might have to reboot the system? I usually don't like doing that. And then as if by magic it started working! I like to map Control to Command and vice versa. My brain was trained by many years of using Windows, a long time ago.</description>

It's not at all surprising that when a tech company hijacks an incomprehensibly huge, world wide platform that's been growing uncontrollably for 25 years, they might overlook some huge applications thereof, and in plotting a transition break the installed base. It's completely foreseeable. Which is why we don't let private companies hijack public resources if we have our heads screwed on straight, which we clearly do not. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I fixed a serious startup bug in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of LO2. Thanks to Steve Hooker for finding and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/91#issuecomment-410838712&quot;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; it. Now would be a great time for people to try the &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/testing/1.8.0/&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt;. I'd like to put it to bed and move on to other projects next week. Thanks! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Reporter vs Journalist</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've written here many times about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/03/whyBloggingIsAnAmateurThing.html&quot;&gt;distinction&lt;/a&gt; between the terms blogger and journalist. In a Twitter thread, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lorakolodny&quot;&gt;Lora Kolodny&lt;/a&gt; makes a distinction between &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lorakolodny/status/1026499041792647168&quot;&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lorakolodny/status/1026499347763027968&quot;&gt;reporter&lt;/a&gt;. I hadn't realized there might be a difference. Here's what she says.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journalist&lt;/i&gt; (besides sounding hi-falutin) includes people who aren't reporters. Editors, producers, photographers, columnists, podcasters, vloggers and bloggers may not all be doing the primary research or interviews for a piece, but are all responsible for accuracy of it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reporters&lt;/i&gt; do the primary fact finding, interviews, field work, etc. But by no means are reporters the only journalists. It's not a commutative property. If reporter then journalist. But not if journalist then reporter.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My own two cents. I'd love to reserve the term blogger for people who write about their own experiences, not for pay, the &quot;unedited voice of a person.&quot; I think of bloggers as sources in the journalism world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Succession</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spoilers ahead, you have been warned! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had been hearing good things about the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; so I chose it for my next binge. I made it all the way to the next to last episode about an hour before the finale aired last night, but waited till the morning to watch it. I wasn't prepared for how disturbing it would be. I wasn't expecting it to be so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think perhaps it was so disturbing because the Roy family reminds me of my own family. All the disconnects, vanity, foolish sense of self-importance. And the prohibition on every talking about it realistically. These were all big features of my upbringing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They really play with you. At times it's so funny, it seems like a comedy, but then, in the next episode, it knocks you down. That's what the finale was like. Complete knock down, with the tour de force in the very last scene. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best line delivered by the patriarch's latest wife to one of the adult children: &quot;He built you a playground and you think it's the world.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of self-awareness in the last episode, but mostly they avoid living their own lives, all of them, including the all-powerful father. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On reflection, the Roy family is not like my family, where the women fought, and the men, while they often roared, were mostly sidelined, not the main act. I guess when you participate in something so intensely for so many hours your subconscious starts accepting it as real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time recommending Succession. It's very well done. But hard to watch at times, it's so awkward and the people are such fools. And it's very disturbing, that gives it value, at least for me. As art, it's outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think it's time to start teaching regular people to do journalism. A civic thing, like jury duty. Every college grad should take a semester of journalism. It's a very important skill to at least appreciate, if not practice.</description>

			<description>I definitely don't want to be part of the debate about whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+racism&quot;&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt; can apply to white people. The dictionary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+racism&quot;&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt; seems to imply it can. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+sexism&quot;&gt;Sexism&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand gives preference to women, but doesn't disallow sexism with men as the target. There's a lot of ridiculous gymnastics used to justify some pretty awful things said that should simply be retracted and apologized for.  One thing is very clear, it's possible to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+abusive&quot;&gt;abusive&lt;/a&gt; without being either sexist or racist. And a lot of what passes for satire is imho abuse. We need a broad, simple, respectful, adult and professional code of conduct on Twitter, and we should have an amnesty for all past sins, and then set about solving problems working together, instead of having these ridiculous fights over who has the right to say what.</description>

			<title>Little Outliner v1.8.0 testing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/testing/1.8.0/&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of LO2 is ready for testing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've completed most of the features planned for this release, so it's a good time for people who'd like to help to start using the new version. I've made a backup of all the outlines, in case there are any data-losing bugs in the software. I don't think there are, because I've used it myself fairly thoroughly, and there aren't many changes to the core outliner in this release. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you encounter any problems or have questions, please post an item in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/91&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; on the Scripting News repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick list of the new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hoisting. There are two new commands in the Outliner menu, Hoist and Dehoist, and two icons in the sidebar, the two pushpins. The commands and pushpins are enabled when the operations are possible. For example, you can only hoist if a headline has subs. You can only dehoist if something is hoisted. You can nest hoists. As far as I know there is no limit to the number of levels. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The crumbtrail. At the top of the outline display is the crumb trail that leads back to the summit from the location of the bar cursor. You can click on any of the links to move the cursor back to that spot. The navigation undoes hoists if necessary. It's a good way to keep track of your context while you're focusing on a specific part of your outline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The SAVED/NOT SAVED indicator. LO2 automatically saves your work.

			<title>Conspiracy theories</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Stan Krute on Facebook wrote how astonished he is about conspiracy theories that real people believe in. I wrote a series of three comments, which I've included here, lightly edited.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My uncle, well educated, highly literate, creative, believed lots of conspiracy theories, and the people he hung out with did too. I believed a few myself when I was younger. So I have some familiarity with it. I think it’s a way of coping with the complexity and dishonesty of everything.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My parents too, when it came to Israel, had lots of what I considered irrational conspiracy like beliefs. Also very literate, highly educated, urban, liberal people.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Eventually as I grew older I got closer to the real power in the world, and understood that it’s just as confusing to the people at the top as it is to the people on the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A good open source identity system</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I use Twitter as the identity system for my browser-based apps. To see how it works, log onto &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://myword.io/editor/&quot;&gt;MyWord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedbase.io/&quot;&gt;feedBase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlecardeditor.com/&quot;&gt;Little Card Editor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like it, it works well, and takes a difficult problem off my plate. It takes a complicated problem and makes it relatively simple for me, as a developer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it works, at a very high level. I send you over there to log in, and in return I get your unique screenname and a bit of info about you (the stuff you put into your profile). And a few other bits, like when you created your Twitter account. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/71debfb607c8bbfd6b639b5bea9bed44&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of the data that Twitter gives an app about a user (me).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also get the ability to post in your name, but my software never uses that ability unless you specifically ask it to. For example, there's a tweet icon in LO2 that lets you send the text of the cursor headline to Twitter as a tweet. Nice functionality to have, but hardly mission-critical.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm concerned that at some point Twitter may decide not to allow this use. I would prefer if they tightened the restrictions on posting, maybe eliminate it, that would be okay. But I would have a problem if they canceled the service. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pretty sure nothing this simple exists in the open source world. I could be wrong. Either way this is something we should have, and it should be good. debugged, well burned-in. It would be nice if a public foundation ran the service, the way Twitter does. I know, keep dreaming. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Disqus ads are hated here</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I really dislike complaining about free services. If you hate a service, my philosophy goes, just opt out. I've been on the other side of this, struggling to provide a free service to users who acted like they were paying huge money, long before there was any monetization of free services. I never want to be one of those people.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes a service is very hard to opt out of, and they take advantage of that, by changing the service from tolerable to obscene. Disqus is now doing that, and it will be hard and/or painful, maybe impossible, for me to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/feedBase/#comment-4017626921&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of one of the pages. And a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/02/disqusScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've used Disqus for comments for many years, probably a decade, maybe more. I included their code in my pages, so users could comment on posts. I've even built support for products on Disqus. Some pages have a lot of comments with valuable information. Just turning off Disqus, a brute force way of opting out, would also remove those comments. And turning off Disqus is hard to do because I don't control the HTTP servers that host most of my content, and changing the HTML pages themselves is a sizeable task (understatement).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How we got here. The old Disqus was fairly innocuous. Of course they spied on the users, and then a few years ago they started including ads, but they were small and out of the way. Now the ads are huge, and getting bigger. They're more prominent than the comments. It's as if I were running ads on my sites, and the comments were clickbait to get you to look at the ads, like so many sites these days. Their ads make me look bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course I don't run ads on my pages. It's never been worth it to me. Those are their ads, paying them money, on my pages. They're changing the deal on pages that were published a long time ago, and are there just to maintain a record.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could probably turn off the display for most of them without modifying any content, using CSS. I now wish I had a central set of styles every page included, but I wasn't so wise as to foresee the need. I have a conundrum. Every time I look at one of the pages with those huge ads on them, I think what a problem, I need to fix this, now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then I remember how impossible it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First step in fixing it, I guess, is documenting the problem. Done.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>You can see in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/01/radio3List.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; when Facebook turned off the cross-posting API. It's a screen shot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; -- the tool I use for linkblogging. It's amazing this has gotten almost no coverage in the press. It's like a tunnel under the Hudson was terminated, where FB is New Jersey and everything else is Manhattan (or vice versa, it doesn't matter). Only this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/psa-cross-posting-tweets-to-facebook-no-longer-works-as-of-today/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch story&lt;/a&gt;. Update: And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.programmableweb.com/news/facebook-breaks-twitter-feature-changing-its-api/2018/08/01&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on ProgrammableWeb.</description>

			<description>A big downside of ceding economic leadership to China is that their norms of freedom will become the norms of the world. Once Google's search engine &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/&quot;&gt;censors&lt;/a&gt; access to the net in China, it's just a matter of time before they do it in the west too.</description>

			<description>When I moved to California from Madison in 1979, I put together a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf&quot;&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt;, in a manner of speaking, about the work I had been doing on an integrated outliner and database that I build into the UCSD P-System running on top of CP/M on a Cromemco machine. I called the product &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf&quot;&gt;HighFiles&lt;/a&gt;, for high level file system. That's how I thought of it. We found a copy of this document in my mom's house back in February. Finally got around to scanning it. It's a time capsule. Some ideas I didn't think I had that early, and some absolute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shaking%20my%20head&quot;&gt;SMH&lt;/a&gt; things, which I'm now putting on the record. I was only 24 back in 1979. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>
