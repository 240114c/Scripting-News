My next project is to figure out how to flow this through an RSS feed so it can be a podcast. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbrianbluestein/&quot;&gt;Richard Bluestein&lt;/a&gt; did the MP3.

			<description>Let Trump ride on the NYC subway for a couple of hours every day and see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-trump-urges-economic-restrart-early-as-next-week-2020-3&quot;&gt;how he feels&lt;/a&gt; then. Turning on the economy in NYC, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/before-trump-called-for-reevaluating-lockdowns-they-shuttered-six-of-his-top-earning-clubs-and-resorts/2020/03/23/88780374-6d38-11ea-aa80-c2470c6b2034_story.html#click=https://t.co/KdxodfguO5&quot;&gt;probably&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/business/trump-businesses-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;what he cares about&lt;/a&gt;, means cramming millions of people into  virus-infested subway cars each for an hour or two every day. If Trump wants to ride with them, well I'd be impressed, and would also ask Mike Pence to be ready to assume the presidency. Trump may have forgotten that at age 73, he's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/24/viral-on-air-plea-captures-an-essential-truth-about-trump/&quot;&gt;expendable class&lt;/a&gt; according to his Republican (supposed) friends. Make sure your will is current Mr President.</description>

			<description>Why America is so bad at Covid-19. Itâ€™s our attitude, there are never consequences for Americans. Thatâ€™s for other people. We have wars and tax cuts at the same time. We donâ€™t see the coffins of our returning dead. Nothing happens to us. We canâ€™t imagine things not being normal. The generation that grew up during World War II, who experienced the Holocaust, the advent of nuclear weapons, that generation is gone now. Everyone alive today, not just boomers, have been spoiled. We're all coming awake now from a life-long trance. For the first time in our lives, we have to deal with the mortality of our country. Don't cry for America. It's time to grow up, again. Couldn't have a more perfect person as president. It's easy to see he is our past. Now how do we move beyond that.</description>

			<description>I always wondered &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1242438120580186113&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; bike delivery people in NYC put plastic bags over the handles of their bikes.

Can still access the gears and brakes this way, which you couldn't do easily in gloves.&quot;</description>

			<description>I read in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/phones-track-spread-covid19-good-idea/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about China and South Korea how they relied on location data from people's phones to know where contagious people had been. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/20.html#a141448&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; had to install one of these apps before they'd let her enter the country, just to switch planes. I'm guessing that in the US we can't use that data even though companies like Google, Apple and Facebook have it. The context has changed, and now trillions of dollars are at stake, the existence of our economy, our lives (hope that's not too dramatic). Perhaps it's time to re-think our assumptions.</description>

The context has changed, and now trillions of dollars are at stake, the existence of our economy, our lives (hope that's not too dramatic). Perhaps it's time to re-think our assumptions." created="Mon, 23 Mar 2020 15:42:11 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/23/southKoreaFlag.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/23.html#a154211"/>

To see what an American city was like after it was half-destroyed. What I learned would inform the people making financial decisions in DC. They're not understanding what's going to be left when this is done. Saving corporations is not a possibility. We should be focused on surviving as people and a country. In Katrina people had somewhere to evacuate to. This time we don't. On the other hand nothing we made need be destroyed. It should mostly be here when we emerge. I suppose pirates could hijack airplanes, or occupy skyscrapers in Manhattan. A question I learned to ask from New Orleans. Who's going to supply the supply chain? They had trouble rebuilding because there was no place for the builders to sleep, and no food for them to eat, and no one to prepare it because they had nowhere to live. We need really smart people there thinking and planning. Yet this is the fog of war. We have very little data on the enemy.</description>

			<title>Using cannabis during Covid-19</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a copy of a Michael Backes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/michael.backes.180/posts/2442563802721764&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, yesterday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Michael Backes studies and writes about cannabis. Here's his best advice about using it &quot;during the 2020 Covid-19 World Tour.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Moderation - Cannabis interacts with your body's endocannabinoid system, which the body uses to regulate physiological function- from immune response to memory. Regular high-dose use reduces the density of your endocannabinoid receptors. That's a really poor choice at the moment. Three days of abstinence can restore a significant part of that lost receptor density. Good time to consider a short break. Trust me, cannabis will be there when you get back.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Find your MED - MED stands for minimum effective dose. There are still folks that think that huge doses of cannabis are a demonstration of their expertise. Sorry, Cheech. The cool folks know that massive doses quickly lead to the disappearance of the subtlest and most interesting effects of cannabis. Find the smallest MED that moves your needle and stick with it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Freeze your stash - Cannabis is more than its THC or CBD content. Cannabis flower is perishable and room temperatures degrade its essential oil content. Freeze and just take what you're going to consume. Make sure the freezer container is airtight (I recommend mason jars, as they come in many sizes and are non-reactive with cannabis.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inhale with care - Cannabis smoke and cannabis concentrates can irritate your lungs and suppress your pulmonary immune function and response. Consider mixing it up by taking cannabis orally or switching to a flower vaporizer. An occasional puff is okay, but only if your lungs are in good shape and you're symptom free. Don't inhale if you have symptoms or have been exposed. Period.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had to run errands into Kingston just now and heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo&quot;&gt;Gov Cuomo's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3h9Z4u4icM&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;. He is masterful. I feel like there's someone in charge who knows what to do and is doing it. I feel lucky to live in New York State, wish we had something approaching that kind of leadership in Washington.</description>

			<description>Now I wish there were a podcast feed for his press conferences so I could listen to them asynchronously. I won't always be able to listen when they're happening. Maybe this is something WNYC or the NY Times could do? Betaworks?</description>

			<description>Rachel Maddow cried at the end of her show last night. I assume for her colleague, a man about my age, who died of CV. But it meant something personal to each of us. I saw it as her crying for the end of America. Reagan was right, government is the problem. But not the way Reagan meant it. I don't know what goes through the minds of the Republicans in Washington, I can't find a bottom to their depravity. It's possible they're masochists. They feel they, and we, deserve to die.</description>

			<description>Thereâ€™s a ticking time bomb. The people who donâ€™t have health insurance and donâ€™t have savings or a job and arenâ€™t part of the stimulus, these people are going to be broke, hungry, homeless and sick. And on CNN theyâ€™re talking about Trump's racist tweets.</description>

			<description>Most times we can convince ourselves that in the immediate future:  1. We will remain alive and well.  2. Our friends and family will too.  What's so unsettling about the moment: Now we know that either, we will be sick or die, or some of our friends and family will. I think that's why we are all reaching out to our friends now, and re-establishing the connection, because we want to hold them close so they don't leave us. It's a good thing. In this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/springtime-in-the-plague-year/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, at the end, Andrew Sullivan talks about that re AIDS, which he experienced as a gay man in the 80s and 90s.  I experienced it as a man with a fatally sick heart in the 00s. After being fixed, I felt like I wanted to die. Weird, right? But real. We call the first feeling &quot;normal.&quot;  Over time, this will become normal.  Then at some point, if we survive, a vaccine or treatment will come about.   And we'll go through the unsettled feeling again.</description>

			<title>From NYC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via email from a young friend who lives in NYC, a medical researcher.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a spectacularly beautiful spring day. I went out biking in the park in the afternoon. Others had the same idea, and it was so crowded it quickly became almost impossible to maintain the 6 foot distance even while riding a bike. The fact is, NYC is just too crowded to make this work well -- social distancing is just not what this city is about. I'm not seeing the kind of distancing you'd hope to see out here; New York has always felt like a human zoo to me, and it still does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My friend and former co-worker's wife is a doctor, just finishing her hospital residency, and they're preparing for all-out war. Constructing tent hospitals outside all the major hospitals to deal with the expected overflow. 5000 confirmed cases now means there were tens of thousands infected a week ago, by the end of this week we will have tens of thousands confirmed, and likely over 100K in less than a month. I am fully expecting NYC to be not only the worst-hit city in the U.S., but possibly the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have listened to that natural instinct I felt when I first visited this place -- too many people, get out -- but it's too late now, I'm riding this out right here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
