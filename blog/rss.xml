			<description>This is weird. If you do a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=What+makes+a+weblog+a+weblog%3F&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=What+makes+a+weblog+a+weblog%3F&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64j69i60l2j69i61.1281j0j3&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;What makes a weblog a weblog?&lt;/i&gt; it links to a page on blogs.harvard.edu that's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/&quot;&gt;Miley Cyrus fan blog&lt;/a&gt;. It was last updated in 2008. Anyway, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html&quot;&gt;original piece&lt;/a&gt;, intended to last for a long time, is still present, even though Google doesn't know about it. Written in 2003, by yours truly, it was an attempt to put a marker down. This is what we were doing way back when. To the future, you know how it turned out. We had no idea.</description>

			<description>New site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://isrssdead.com/&quot;&gt;IsRSSDead.com&lt;/a&gt;. I saw a similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://israilsdead.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; for Ruby on Rails, and immediately wanted one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. The first text on the page was rude because I think it's a rude question. The next answer was sarcastic. And now there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/11/isRssDead.png&quot;&gt;polite answer&lt;/a&gt;. It's given me a lot of ideas. I think I might put a reverse chronologic list of news sites that have updated recently. The list of news orgs that support RSS is impressive. Any news syndication standard would be happy with such support. And maybe list some of the software devs who have invested in RSS, and who continue to do so. Standards aren't alive or dead, but as long as people persist in blaming RSS for their problems, we should probably accept the challenge. And thanks to the Rails folks for the idea. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CharlesPPierce/status/1226855965959639040&quot;&gt;Charles Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, a columnist at Esquire, asks why suddenly James Carville is relevant (again). This my friends is exactly what's wrong with journalism and politics. Carville isn't any more or less relevant now. He did however do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/-wake-up-dem-vet-calls-for-party-to-be-more-relevant-diverse-after-iowa-chaos-78129221946&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC where he said exactly what the Democrats are doing to lose the election, and correctly stated what the election is about and what the consequences would be of losing. It was a passionate wakeup call that apparently rippled out to Pierce's perch in the hierarchy of punditry, who hears it as the question he asks. Why is Carville relevant, he asks. Better question, why is Pierce such an idiot? It doesn't matter who sees the truth and yells it loud enough to pierce the fog of your self-importance, what matters is that &lt;i&gt;it's the truth. &lt;/i&gt;We are, as Carville says, on our way to electing Trump to another term, when what we need to do is win so decisively that we have the power to undo the damage he did. We need to be very smart, focused and not worry about Pierce's pecking order. Yet our pundits and political leaders are mostly just worried about doing what they always do, being well paid and as Pierce puts it, relevant.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/09/2020_02_08-oddcast.mp3&quot;&gt;Doc's latest podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about outlines. What they taught you about outlining in school was dishonest. We cheated, we wrote the outline after writing the paper. But it's not like that on the computer: reorganizing is easy. The text is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/11/12/textOnRails.html&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;. Doc understands structure and outlining, as you can hear in this podcast. The one common thing about all outliner users -- they think about how they think. Once you do that, it makes sense to look for tools to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/&quot;&gt;augment&lt;/a&gt; that. I'm going to let Doc tell you the rest.

			<description>Someone should write a piece about how much worse it's going to be with Trump than the press is willing to admit. This time he is going to have his political opponents prosecuted and jailed. He's not just going to get dirt on them, he's going to take them off the field.</description>

			<description>I did a small overhaul of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; code yesterday. Screwing with that code is inherently dangerous, make a mistake and the wrong email goes out to all the subscribers. Or it doesn't go out at all. This kind of code is notoriously hard to test. Anyway it worked. Whew. And one of the side-effects is that the emails go out at 12:00 PM, not 12:02 PM. I know just a two-minute difference, but I'm a perfectionist, and the two minutes really bothered me. Also it's more reliable, which is the real reason I did the work.</description>

			<source:outline text="I did a small overhaul of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; code yesterday. Screwing with that code is inherently dangerous, make a mistake and the wrong email goes out to all the subscribers. Or it doesn't go out at all. This kind of code is notoriously hard to test. Anyway it worked. Whew. And one of the side-effects is that the emails go out at 12:00 PM, not 12:02 PM. I know just a two-minute difference, but I'm a perfectionist, and the two minutes really bothered me. Also it's more reliable, which is the real reason I did the work." created="Sun, 09 Feb 2020 14:13:59 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/09.html#a141359"/>

			<description>Doc asked in passing what it means when a section of the outline has chevrons in place of the wedges. In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/08/commentExample.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; the red arrow points to a comment. It means the text is commented. You toggle the feature with Cmd-\. Like everything in an outline, it's hierarchic, so when you comment a headline, it and all its subs are commented. Okay so now what does it mean to be commented? It depends on who processes the outline. The idea originated in programming, when you want to explain a bit of code, you'd tell the code interpreter the writing by &quot;commenting it out.&quot; Comments are like speaker notes for code. That was the long answer. The short one is that, for what you're doing now, it probably doesn't matter if some text is commented or not. It'll happen if you press Cmd-\ by accident.</description>

			<description>I turned off the &lt;a href=&quot;http://likes.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Likes feature&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News. Most people are reading the stuff through email and RSS. Likes predates the email distribution. The server is a bit of a hog. But the most important thing was that it wasn't being used. If it had gained traction I would have been ready to do the work to get it smoothed out. The code is still there, the server is still running, so I could turn it back on any time.</description>

			<description>Fixed a bunch of bugs in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; over the last few days. Still have a lot more to work on. It's great having people use it. It was hard to focus on it when I wasn't getting any feedback. I can't emphasize enough how important it is for me to have a connection with smart enthusiastic users.</description>

			<description>BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; is just another name for &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;. There was a previous version that was quite different. So when the second version was on the way, I called it LO2. Also because typing &lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing: 0.04em&quot;&gt;LITTLE OUTLINER&lt;/span&gt; was more work than LO2. Sorry for the confusion.</description>

			<description>It's a two voicemailcast Friday. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/05/daveToDoc2.m4a&quot;&gt;The first one&lt;/a&gt; is from me, to kick it off, and a response from Doc will follow in the next item. I have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/g4&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt;, but they were the notes I took before doing the podcast, I didn't clean them up, so you're seeing D2D (Dave-to-Dave) communication. I recorded this on Wednesday. And some of the items in the outline didn't make it into the cast. Still diggin.</description>

			<description>As I say in my podcast, this series is a rambling disorganized and repetitive conversation between Doc and myself. I'm getting huge value out of it. We're not going to hire a writer to do transcripts, because after that we'd need an editor to make sense of it. Maybe someday, could be a book or something, but right now it's just a conversation between two old friends. And it's giving me amazing information for my software development work.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/153&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: Here's an interesting piece of data. I said Hey Doc, create an AWS account. I didn't tell him how to do it.  I wanted to see what happened. He didn't succeed. OK so this means to me that we need a piece of software. A rough idea of how it would work. The user signs on to their Amazon account, the one they use to buy socks, and then authorizes you to act on its behalf with AWS. Ideally that would feel, to the user, like giving access to an app to use their Twitter identity. From there, you create a pair of S3 buckets, one private and one public. Then you allow my software to access his bucket. I don't know what all these steps are. But it should draw on a user's ability to create accounts on other popular services. I imagine it's what Amazon itself would create if they wanted to provide a service to non-developers. I imagine at this time they consider it a &quot;developer opportunity.&quot; I need this functionality as a go-between my users and my software. I don't want to store their stuff long-term, because I dont have a long-term.</description>

			<description>I did a search on Google yesterday trying to find a US government website. The top hit took me to a site that looked like the site I was looking for. I started filling in my information, then I noticed the URL wasn't on a .gov domain. Looked closer and realized it was a hack. I don't want to publicize the search; just to say there's another attack vector I hadn't considered and should have. I assumed a hack wouldn't be a top hit for a government site on Google.</description>

			<description>Candidates who aren't likable aren't usually elected. Like Mike Dukakis. The Repubs mocked him. On paper he was a better candidate than Bush. Bush won. Bush said cute shit like Big Mo. And ran racist ads about Willie Horton. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/07/dukakisInTheTank.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of Dukakis in the tank. He lost the election when asked would he favor the death penalty if someone &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1844704_1844706_1844712,00.html&quot;&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; his wife Kitty.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PICluK9Wjzs&quot;&gt;This video explains&lt;/a&gt; how the Repubs tore Michael Dukakis apart in 1988. Remember that when choosing a candidate to run against Trump, who is the great-great-grandchild heir to this slash-and-burn style of campaign. The Democratic Party in its current shape will not be able to help the nominee. That's why, even if you don't like oligarchs, it's so important that Bloomberg is building a campaign attack machine as fast as he can.</description>

When the Senate votes on something consequential, such as whether to remove the president, let's have a readout that shows the number of people the Yes votes represent, by state, and the number of people the No votes represent. It would measure how far our government is from being a democracy. I would love to see this as a website.</description>

			<description>Randall Neff did an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/06/Senate-vote-2020-02-05.xlsx&quot;&gt;Excel spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; for the impeachment trial. It wasn't as lopsided as I imagined. Roughly 52% to convict, 48% to acquit. The reps of a majority of Americans thought he was guilty, but not nearly enough to convict him. Here's the spreadsheet &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/06/Senate-vote-2020-02-05.pdf&quot;&gt;in PDF&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Why is Trump's approval rating going up? This question came up on Brian Lehrer's fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;WNYC radio show&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Here's my theory. During the trial, Trump wasn't controlling the public conversation. So we didn't always hear about Trump's latest outrage every minute of every day. If he were to tone it down permanently, only spoke when a president would normally speak, he might be more popular.</description>

			<description>It's been a while since we had an Occam's News report. Here's the latest. In the impeachment trial, if the jury could have been sure there would be no retribution for a vote of guilty, a lot more would have voted that way. A bunch of them would have voted to acquit even if there would be no retribution, because they think the US is going to privatize massive parts of the government, and they want to be in position to get some of that. Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz.</description>

			<description>I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1224834573688766466&quot;&gt;James Carville&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC last night. He speaks for me. The goal of this election is to get power. To do that we need to run a smart campaign as in 2018. He says the party needs a new chairman, who should it be -- he says Ask Nancy Pelosi. Beat the drum with talking points that rarely stray off health care, climate, education. Over and over.  Take power and get the Repubs out of the way and then do what needs to be done. Pick a presidential candidate that fits this plan. Nothing more complex. We're not electing god, we're electing someone who can lead us out of the nightmare of a morass we are now in. Wake the fuck up people who think the election is about the candidates. It is not. Once we have a plan, the candidate will follow the plan. That's all. Think like someone in a smoke filled room. We wanted that power, now learn to use it. That's what Carville said last night. Really passionate and smart.</description>

			<description>The only criteria for a candidate: I want someone who, when a Republican who believes in the rule of law sees them, they think -- I could vote for them. Even better, I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to vote for them. In this election there are two sides, one side believes in the rule of law, the other doesn't.

			<description>Yesterday I signed up for the Bloomberg campaign. I take him at his word, if he isn't the nominee, he will back the actual candidate with his money and organization. I hope he starts a political social network, the one I thought Obama was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;, not to make money (eg FB, Twitter), rather to allow us to organize politically without interference from trolls. Someone has to do this, I hope Bloomberg will.</description>
