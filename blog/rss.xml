			<title>What happened last night, part 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was a big deal in American politics. You know &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-beat-expectations-on-super-tuesday/&quot;&gt;the news&lt;/a&gt;. Biden scored big, at the expense of Sanders. Beyond that everything else is subject to opinion and polling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the evening I wrote: &quot;I honestly don't think people want Biden, I think they really &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want Sanders.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raines.com/&quot;&gt;Raines Cohen&lt;/a&gt; asked: &quot;If that were the case, why not Warren?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Before I answer, a couple of things about Raines. I've known him for a very long time, since I met him in Mitch Kapor's office in Cambridge in 1979. His father was Mitch's lawyer. I think Raines was all of 13 years old then. I was 25. Second, he's a friend, and I trust him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I gave him an honest answer, what I really think is true. With Warren fans I find you have to tiptoe around their certainty that anyone who says anything negative about her is a misogynist, or &quot;a person who dislikes, despises or is strongly prejudiced against women.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think Warren and Sanders are similar, but not on policy, on the way they approach the electorate, and I think to the extent they are rejected, it's for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I saw a meanness in Warren that I didnâ€™t like. A good president tries to draw everyone in, make everyone feel welcome. Neither her or Sanders has that impulse, like Trump.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Look at how people talk about her on the net â€” if you donâ€™t support her youâ€™re a misogynist. If you donâ€™t support Sanders, youâ€™re The Establishment. That excuses both of them from trying to understand who they arenâ€™t reaching. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If Iâ€™m their enemy, their scapegoat, Iâ€™m not voting for them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think theyâ€™re both smart enough to know this especially Warren. That makes them dangerous. The president of the United States must be a consensus builder. Not someone who could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose a single supporter. Warren created a wedge, based on gender, intentional or not. Men bad, women good. With predictable results, imho. It's a turnoff because we need to come together, and smart voters know this. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People who do &quot;turnout math&quot; miss this point. It isn't just getting people to the polls to vote for you, it's getting the country to see itself as one thing, not warring factions. These Democrats, Sanders and Warren, are doing what Trump did. Dividing. Wedging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Their policies aren't new, they're standard Democratic policies. Any Democrat would pursue those goals if we demand they do. The power is ours, as long as we stick together. Democrats who try to drive us apart are no better than Republicans who do that.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Ezra Klein said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21164091/sanders-biden-super-tuesday-endorsements-primary-2020&quot;&gt;same thing&lt;/a&gt; in a different way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>After many attempts, I'm now rolling on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Expanse&lt;/a&gt;. In the middle of season 2, I more or less understand who the characters are and the plot. I don't know why it took so many tries to get it. &lt;span class=&quot;spSpoiler&quot;&gt;I am sure that Julie Mao and Miller are melding into some kind of incredible love monster whose body is the planet of Venus. I also think their meeting was the sexiest thing I've seen on TV ever&lt;/span&gt;.</description>

			<description>Democrats have one goal. Trump out in a landslide. All the insiders talk about turnout, but you know what, that's up to us, the voters. I think that's the message of tonight. If he wins, Biden has been drafted to be our representative. We should organize &lt;i&gt;ourselves&lt;/i&gt; so we can't be ignored after the election.</description>

			<title>My father apologized</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something really weird happened in a dream last night.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My father apologized for something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's been dead since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He never apologized for anything to anyone as far as I recall, certainly not to me. He said and did plenty he should have apologized for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think in a weird way this is my subconscious telling me that it's ready to forgive him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the dream I felt so safe and secure in the moment, I said genuinely, don't worry about it, we can fix the problem right now. Then we went to the post office and I mailed a package to someone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A few years ago I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/08/theWorldIsSocialistPartIi.html&quot;&gt;Health care is socialist&lt;/a&gt;, about health insurance. But I didn't consider this. If there's a lethal virus going around, and we want to slow it down, we need to know where it is. That's the first thing. We have to test lots of people as they are in South Korea. I suppose we could require that people pay for their own tests, but that's just a tax. We might as well simplify the accounting and pay for the testing with tax dollars. It's the same thing. So when Repubs say it would be bad to make health care socialist, they're tricking you. It already is socialist. They just want to siphon off a fat chunk of the health care money for themselves, for doing nothing.</description>

			<description>Two things to watch out for re the virus. 1. There will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy&quot;&gt;anti-vaxer&lt;/a&gt; types who will say the test gives you the disease, so a fair number of people will refuse to be tested. 2. The government will realize that they need to control the press to control the flow of info about the virus. Best to think about it in case it happens. People who read this blog might be the people who figure out how to distribute info even if the government is trying to stop it. Probably will be easier to do before the press is controlled.</description>

			<description>Voter suppression is a philosophical crime. In the US we have a rule -- one person, one vote. So from a voting standpoint, state govt officials have as much say as any other voter.

			<title>Cancel culture</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was at dinner with friends last week and the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22cancel+culture%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;cancel culture&lt;/a&gt; came up. Some of them were not familiar with what it is. I promised to try to explain here on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emptywheel.net/2020/02/19/what-happens-after-youre-cancelled/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Norton&quot;&gt;Quinn Norton&lt;/a&gt; about getting cancelled. Briefly, she had gotten a plum job on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/opinion/editorialboard.html&quot;&gt;Editorial Board&lt;/a&gt; of the NY Times, but then when the appointment was announced, controversial tweets she had retweeted (according to her account) surfaced.  The Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/business/media/quinn-norton-new-york-times.html&quot;&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; the offer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a public presence on the net is subject to cancellation. I have had people trying to get me fired for my public writing since the early 90s, when someone called UserLand's office to try to get me fired for my not-sufficiently-Apple-loyal posts on AppleLink. Since then, it's happened many times. The pressure to conform is one of the reasons I deliberately lowered my online profile in the early 2000s after coming pretty close to dying, at least in part from the stress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/28/214733.html?title=whyWarrenFreaksMeOut#a214754&quot;&gt;Warren&lt;/a&gt; attacked Bloomberg on stage at the Democratic debate, she was trying to get him cancelled, and presumably to gain notoriety for herself for being the one who did the cancelling. So cancel culture has arrived at the highest level of US politics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/business/media/quinn-norton-new-york-times.html&quot;&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; the offer." created="Sun, 01 Mar 2020 19:04:51 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/01/185236.html?title=cancelCulture#a190451"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyone with a public presence on the net is subject to cancellation. I have had people trying to get me fired for my public writing since the early 90s, when someone called UserLand's office to try to get me fired for my not-sufficiently-Apple-loyal posts on AppleLink. Since then, it's happened many times. The pressure to conform is one of the reasons I deliberately lowered my online profile in the early 2000s after coming pretty close to dying, at least in part from the stress." created="Sun, 01 Mar 2020 19:05:55 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/01/cancelled.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/01/185236.html?title=cancelCulture#a190555"/>

So cancel culture has arrived at the highest level of US politics." created="Sun, 01 Mar 2020 19:06:32 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/01/185236.html?title=cancelCulture#a190632"/>
