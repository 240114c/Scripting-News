			<description>Doc asked in passing what it means when a section of the outline has chevrons in place of the wedges. In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/08/commentExample.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; the red arrow points to a comment. It means the text is commented. You toggle the feature with Cmd-\. Like everything in an outline, it's hierarchic, so when you comment a headline, it and all its subs are commented. Okay so now what does it mean to be commented? It depends on who processes the outline. The idea originated in programming, when you want to explain a bit of code, you'd tell the code interpreter the writing by &quot;commenting it out.&quot; Comments are like speaker notes for code. That was the long answer. The short one is that, for what you're doing now, it probably doesn't matter if some text is commented or not. It'll happen if you press Cmd-\ by accident.</description>

			<description>I turned off the &lt;a href=&quot;http://likes.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Likes feature&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News. Most people are reading the stuff through email and RSS. Likes predates the email distribution. The server is a bit of a hog. But the most important thing was that it wasn't being used. If it had gained traction I would have been ready to do the work to get it smoothed out. The code is still there, the server is still running, so I could turn it back on any time.</description>

			<description>Fixed a bunch of bugs in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; over the last few days. Still have a lot more to work on. It's great having people use it. It was hard to focus on it when I wasn't getting any feedback. I can't emphasize enough how important it is for me to have a connection with smart enthusiastic users.</description>

			<description>BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; is just another name for &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;. There was a previous version that was quite different. So when the second version was on the way, I called it LO2. Also because typing &lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing: 0.04em&quot;&gt;LITTLE OUTLINER&lt;/span&gt; was more work than LO2. Sorry for the confusion.</description>

			<description>It's a two voicemailcast Friday. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/05/daveToDoc2.m4a&quot;&gt;The first one&lt;/a&gt; is from me, to kick it off, and a response from Doc will follow in the next item. I have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/g4&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt;, but they were the notes I took before doing the podcast, I didn't clean them up, so you're seeing D2D (Dave-to-Dave) communication. I recorded this on Wednesday. And some of the items in the outline didn't make it into the cast. Still diggin.</description>

			<description>As I say in my podcast, this series is a rambling disorganized and repetitive conversation between Doc and myself. I'm getting huge value out of it. We're not going to hire a writer to do transcripts, because after that we'd need an editor to make sense of it. Maybe someday, could be a book or something, but right now it's just a conversation between two old friends. And it's giving me amazing information for my software development work.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/153&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: Here's an interesting piece of data. I said Hey Doc, create an AWS account. I didn't tell him how to do it.  I wanted to see what happened. He didn't succeed. OK so this means to me that we need a piece of software. A rough idea of how it would work. The user signs on to their Amazon account, the one they use to buy socks, and then authorizes you to act on its behalf with AWS. Ideally that would feel, to the user, like giving access to an app to use their Twitter identity. From there, you create a pair of S3 buckets, one private and one public. Then you allow my software to access his bucket. I don't know what all these steps are. But it should draw on a user's ability to create accounts on other popular services. I imagine it's what Amazon itself would create if they wanted to provide a service to non-developers. I imagine at this time they consider it a &quot;developer opportunity.&quot; I need this functionality as a go-between my users and my software. I don't want to store their stuff long-term, because I dont have a long-term.</description>

			<description>I did a search on Google yesterday trying to find a US government website. The top hit took me to a site that looked like the site I was looking for. I started filling in my information, then I noticed the URL wasn't on a .gov domain. Looked closer and realized it was a hack. I don't want to publicize the search; just to say there's another attack vector I hadn't considered and should have. I assumed a hack wouldn't be a top hit for a government site on Google.</description>

			<description>Candidates who aren't likable aren't usually elected. Like Mike Dukakis. The Repubs mocked him. On paper he was a better candidate than Bush. Bush won. Bush said cute shit like Big Mo. And ran racist ads about Willie Horton. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/07/dukakisInTheTank.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of Dukakis in the tank. He lost the election when asked would he favor the death penalty if someone &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1844704_1844706_1844712,00.html&quot;&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; his wife Kitty. He gave a totally rational response. They said he was cold. It stuck.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PICluK9Wjzs&quot;&gt;This video explains&lt;/a&gt; how the Repubs tore Michael Dukakis apart in 1988. Remember that when choosing a candidate to run against Trump, who is the great-great-grandchild heir to this slash-and-burn style of campaign. The Democratic Party in its current shape will not be able to help the nominee. That's why, even if you don't like oligarchs, it's so important that Bloomberg is building a campaign attack machine as fast as he can.</description>

When the Senate votes on something consequential, such as whether to remove the president, let's have a readout that shows the number of people the Yes votes represent, by state, and the number of people the No votes represent. It would measure how far our government is from being a democracy. I would love to see this as a website.</description>

			<description>Randall Neff did an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/06/Senate-vote-2020-02-05.xlsx&quot;&gt;Excel spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; for the impeachment trial. It wasn't as lopsided as I imagined. Roughly 52% to convict, 48% to acquit. The reps of a majority of Americans thought he was guilty, but not nearly enough to convict him. Here's the spreadsheet &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/06/Senate-vote-2020-02-05.pdf&quot;&gt;in PDF&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Why is Trump's approval rating going up? This question came up on Brian Lehrer's fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;WNYC radio show&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Here's my theory. During the trial, Trump wasn't controlling the public conversation. So we didn't always hear about Trump's latest outrage every minute of every day. If he were to tone it down permanently, only spoke when a president would normally speak, he might be more popular.</description>

			<description>It's been a while since we had an Occam's News report. Here's the latest. In the impeachment trial, if the jury could have been sure there would be no retribution for a vote of guilty, a lot more would have voted that way. A bunch of them would have voted to acquit even if there would be no retribution, because they think the US is going to privatize massive parts of the government, and they want to be in position to get some of that. Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz.</description>

			<description>I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1224834573688766466&quot;&gt;James Carville&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC last night. He speaks for me. The goal of this election is to get power. To do that we need to run a smart campaign as in 2018. He says the party needs a new chairman, who should it be -- he says Ask Nancy Pelosi. Beat the drum with talking points that rarely stray off health care, climate, education. Over and over.  Take power and get the Repubs out of the way and then do what needs to be done. Pick a presidential candidate that fits this plan. Nothing more complex. We're not electing god, we're electing someone who can lead us out of the nightmare of a morass we are now in. Wake the fuck up people who think the election is about the candidates. It is not. Once we have a plan, the candidate will follow the plan. That's all. Think like someone in a smoke filled room. We wanted that power, now learn to use it. That's what Carville said last night. Really passionate and smart.</description>

Even better, I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to vote for them. In this election there are two sides, one side believes in the rule of law, the other doesn't.

			<description>Yesterday I signed up for the Bloomberg campaign. I take him at his word, if he isn't the nominee, he will back the actual candidate with his money and organization. I hope he starts a political social network, the one I thought Obama was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;, not to make money (eg FB, Twitter), rather to allow us to organize politically without interference from trolls.

			<title>We lost the war</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1225111846207684608&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; by Joe Biden just now where he asks if the government he was part of was a failure. When you ask the question like that, the answer is somewhat startling. Yes. The Obama government was a failure. In the same way the French government of 1940 was a failure. Sure, they passed some good laws, and the people of France were happy, but when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France&quot;&gt;Germans marched into Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1940, you would have to say that the existing government of France failed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We were attacked in 2016, and we lost. How do I know we lost? We're not mounting a defense. We didn't counter-attack. If we had, and we had won, Putin would be gone, and Russia would be establishing an American style government. Instead, Putin is fine, and we're installing, gradually, a Russian-style government. That's the only explanation for what's happening in the Senate this afternoon at 4PM Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden, if he has any honor, will withdraw from the race. We lost. He was VP when we lost. We cannot under any circumstances go back to that approach. That would be certainly a loser. If there's any hope for us, we need a very radical departure from the previous path, and I do not mean Bernie Sanders. People who think that are as much in denial as Joe Biden was before he asked the question. Now that he has, if he has guts like he says he does, it's time to step aside. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Is there a reason Nancy Pelosi can't be the next president? If there is I don't know what it is. In fact, she is our leader. And a very good one at that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't know why people take the shortcut of saying other people are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/09.html#a205150&quot;&gt;tone deaf&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously the person who they're saying it to doesn't agree. Do they really want to argue about that? What's the point. It's like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTP_SdjD5ms&quot;&gt;Donald Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; is screaming and pointing at someone who is not yet possessed. Look I found a human, the accuser seems to be saying. It's not a good look.</description>

			<title>Takeaways from Iowa</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of takeaways from last night's meltdown of the vote-counting system in Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Do not depend on your online systems. You must have a backup system that's tested as well as the primary system.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There was another probably more important story last night, where real news had been made during the day. The obsession of the previous week -- impeachment. Since you didn't have anything going on in Iowa, why not provide coverage of what happened in Congress during the day when no one was watching. Might have had a positive impact for the country. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On MSNBC there was a party atmosphere. As if finally we don't have to talk about doom and gloom, for a few minutes we can go back to the naivete of the 2016 election when we could laugh about Trump. Or who knows what they thought was so funny. The news, which ostensibly is their business, is as funny as a heart attack during a nuclear holocaust. Having a party on TV now would be like laughing as the world was mourning Kobe Bryant. Look, CNN and MSNBC should be news rooms. If you don't know what that means, either get out of the way, or learn. Your job is to always be asking yourself Is This Actually News? Last night they had nothing. And they acted like idiots. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At one point Chris Hayes commented you know it's fun to actually not view voters in the aggregate. Yes Chris, we think, we have ideas, we see things you'll never see, and you could stop and figure out what's important about your new realization. That there are way more of us than you, and we're the real power in the country, not the politicians you fawn over, and the other journalists of course.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've said this many times. If you want to help yourselves and the country, move your newsroom to the midwest. Maybe you'll have to do all your interviews over the net. It's getting pretty good. But at least the moderators' perspective will be altered somewhat, will get out of that fetid putrid bubble you all live in. Important stuff is happening, and you're blowing it. It's time to shake things up in journalism. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; that Iowa melted down. It'll wake everyone up. Even if the caucus is a total loss, it's a small price to pay to get people to pay attention to the way we're using online systems in politics and journalism. Especially in 2020 where our systems are undefended against terrorism, it's a certainty we will be replaying this, on a much larger scale, at some time during the process.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why is this process so freaking long! The horserace provides good TV, I guess, if what you want to do is play video games during the broadcast (that's what I do), but we've got other more pressing business than the minutia that people think of as news in this period. It's in the boredom of the interminably long election that Hillary's Emails were invented. We would never have had time for Hunter Biden and Burisma. The length of the process is something the Repubs have mastered for their mischief. Let's not give them such a tempting target. First primary is in July, say, and it's five huge swing states. Then the rest. That's it. Then a convention and Election Day. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

I have a feeling a lot of people didn't hear this historic, passionate plea for America. The Repubs in Congress aren't listening, but we imho must. It's really right up there with JFK's inauguration speech in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy&quot;&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Schiff and the House Democrats for standing up for America.</description>

			<description>Complaining that Bloomberg is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbc-contributor-clashes-with-bernie-campaign-co-chair-nina-turner-after-she-blasts-bloomberg-as-an-oligarch/&quot;&gt;oligarch&lt;/a&gt; in the age of Citizens United is like (I was trying to think of an analogy and failed) ridiculous. Of course he's an oligarch. And his ads are good Democratic values ads. He knows how to market. Kick back and thank god someone does. (This was the beginning of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1224522337288171522&quot;&gt;long rant&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. Enjoy!)</description>

			<description>I used to call for presidential candidates to try to work with Repubs, but that's changed since Friday's vote re evidence for impeachment. They are complicit, as corrupt as the president. There is no working with any Republican who is in Congress at this time.</description>

			<description>Over on Facebook Terry Heaton &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/03/terry.png&quot;&gt;posted a screed&lt;/a&gt; in support of Jennifer Lopez in last night's SuperBowl halftime show. To me it was a big meh. I find those kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows#1960s&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; unimpressive, the music not interesting. I came to watch football, not dance. I'm not kidding. Even Prince, the Stones, Bruce, etc didn't get me off. I was in the kitchen during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrobe_malfunction&quot;&gt;wardrobe malfunction&lt;/a&gt;. But -- Terry's post is noteworthy because he ends it with this line: &quot;America is facing the destruction of our democracy, and we're worried about this?&quot; We should make a button out of that. Tatoo it on our forehead so we see it in the mirror. We need to be &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; to each other, find ways to combine our power, not minimize it. Let's go Mets! and thanks for listening.</description>

			<description>It turns out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150#issuecomment-581407743&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; of the problem that a user was experiencing with the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/privacybadger&quot;&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; from EFF. I gather it's something that a user can disable, so if you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; and you're running Privacy Badger, you should disable their distrust of scripting.com and then LO2 should work as it should.</description>

			<description>What's really sad is that the user doesn't get an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/03/privacyBadgerMessage.png&quot;&gt;error message&lt;/a&gt; that they can pass on to support so we can avoid having the user go to the JavaScript console (an unnatural act for most of our users) to find the error that's causing the app not to load.</description>
