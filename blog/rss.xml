			<description>An idea for the new Democratic majority in the House. Pass a bill that fixes all the problems in ObamaCare. Suggest the Senate could ratify it and the President could sign it. A victory for everyone. The Dems prove that leadership works better than obstruction.</description>

			<description>Sometimes I think my vision is failing but it's just a ripped contact lens. One of the easiest cures known to man -- replace the fucked up lens. Voila. Vision returns to normal.</description>

			<title>We won!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The top line of the news re yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/midterm-elections/2018/11/7/18070802/midterm-elections-results-2018-republicans-losses-trump-house-democrats-majority&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; in the US is that we won. The Constitution won. The US gets another chance. We don't get flushed down the autocracy  toilet, at least not yet. Now here are some bullet points.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A lot of people who voted for Trump in 2016 voted for a Democrat this year to represent them in the House. The entire House was up for election, so the results indicate the choice of all of America. Only 34 Senate seats were contested, and the nature of the Senate, where tiny North Dakota gets as much representation as California or New York, doesn't tell you so much about the collective mind of the people. And in the Senate the Dems were on the defense, Repubs on offense. What we can see from the results of this election is that if the mood of the electorate is constant, the Repubs will have a much harder time retaining control in 2020. And Trump, if he chooses to run again, will have a much harder time winning in 2020 than he did in 2016. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Journalists are reporting that Congress is divided now like the rest of the country. That's such bullshit. As if the government was designed to be controlled by one party with the Congress subservient to the executive branch. What they call &quot;division&quot; is actually democracy. We all get a voice in governing. In 2017 and 2018, the majority of the electorate was shut out of governing. We had no say. As a result the Repubs have run wild with corruption and really stupid decisions (heard of climate change, the Repubs don't believe in it, for example). Now we return to the normal process of governing, where one faction doesn't control the whole thing, and if we want to move, we have to compromise. Yes, that's been rare in the last decade, but a logjam is preferable to one party running rampant. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Imagine if it had gone the other way, and the Repubs had retained control of the House. Imagine the demons that would have been unleashed by that.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Oversight. I heard a reporter on NPR say that now there will be &quot;more oversight.&quot; I suppose technically that's true, but it doesn't really capture the essence. We're going from zero oversight to hopefully intelligent oversight. Imagine the Mafia taking over the government and the police and you have an idea of what the last two years have been like. Now we have a way of looking into the crimes of the Trumps, maybe because they know they'll be exposed they'll be a little less bold? Either way we'll get some ability to see behind the bullshit now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Who will lead the oversight? Very capable people. My own rep, Jerry Nadler will be chairman of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://judiciary.house.gov/&quot;&gt;Judiciary&lt;/a&gt; committee. Elijah Cummings will chair the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oversight.house.gov/&quot;&gt;Oversight&lt;/a&gt; committee. &lt;a href=&quot;https://intelligence.house.gov/&quot;&gt;Adam Schiff&lt;/a&gt; on Intelligence and Maxine Waters on &lt;a href=&quot;https://financialservices.house.gov/&quot;&gt;Financial Services&lt;/a&gt;.  All are a vast improvement over the hacks the Repubs put in those jobs. And I say that without a hint of partisanship. If any of the Repubs had had the courage to actually do their jobs in the last Congress, I would be singing their praises and the country wouldn't be in such a deep hole. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Most important -- the American people are not fascists. Yes there are some who hate Jews and people of color and Muslims and gays and people who don't think like them. Too many. But the majority of Americans are good, and eventually saw through all the confusion the Repubs throw at the process. I expect that more will see it that way in the coming years. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't know what a &quot;wave election&quot; is and I don't care. I just care that we came back from the edge yesterday and decided as a country to fight. That's as much good news as I could have hoped for, a very good outcome. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a Democrat or Republican. I voted Republican until 2004, when I saw where they were taking us and I became a committed member of the resistance. I couldn't believe we re-elected Bush. And all the events that followed. I could vote Republican again, or even better would love to be part of a new party formed with people who may disagree on all kinds of policy issues, but agree on regular order and the sanctity of the vote and the rule of law. A party that would never try to suppress people's vote, or create misery to try to win elections. A party with real respect for the people. From there we can debate and compromise, win some, lose some, and live our lives with respect for each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think my new iMac Pro is more sensitive about wifi connections than my previous iMac, where I could leave a Terminal window open to a server for &lt;i&gt;weeks&lt;/i&gt; and it would stay up. Now, typically, I have to restore the connection every the morning. The only variable that changed on my end is the computer and of course the OS.</description>

			<description>An idea for a simple web service. Watch your own Twitter account and keep an outline of all your posts, ready to be copy/pasted into your blog or emails or other writing. This didn't used to be interesting because of the 140 char limit, but 280 is enough to write down an idea. It's easier for me to jot down an idea on my phone in Twitter than in another app. And their API makes this even more useful.</description>

			<title>Fallout from the new watch</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: I wrote this narrative, then stumbled across a fix, at the end. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bought a new Apple Watch. So far it's just like the old one. I bought it for the health features. If it can give me a realtime EKG, that alone is worth the price. Heart rate, etc, all good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I had to update my iPhone to get it to talk to the new watch. And as usual the problems cascade from there. First my phone says I also need a new version of the Watch app. OK. Then the Watch app, first thing it wants to do is update the old watch. Nothing can convince it not to do this. Only other choice is to reset to factory defaults. It gets half-way through, and says oops you have to charge it up to 50 percent or no-go. Okay that takes about an hour. And that's far from the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now completely separate from the Watch and its software, most of the apps on my iPhone are gone. Ones I built the use of the phone around. &lt;i&gt;This kind of shit always happens with Apple updates. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get this. The apps are there. If I search it finds them. They just aren't on the desktop. I had about 5 pages of apps before the update. Now I have two pages and there's only one app on the second page. All kinds of apps are missing from the desktop. Apple apps. BigCo apps (Facebook, Twitter). Apps for managing various brands of headphones I have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then I stumbled across a fix. I deleted one of the apps, and the rest came back. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Dropbox is finished with its &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/02.html#a140427&quot;&gt;sync&lt;/a&gt;. The new iMac Pro desktop is up to date. This caused its own problems. I edit my blog in an outliner that saves to a Dropbox-sync'd folder. This way I can use the same editor on my laptop when I'm traveling. I reloaded the editor this morning, the month of November was gone. I guess overnight Dropbox replaced the new version with the old version. It has missed the last few days of my work. Luckily I was also writing the OPML to a server, so I had a backup copy. I could have always re-entered the text from the website, so it wasn't ever in danger of being lost. Not sure what the moral of the story is. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>A post from Facebook in 2014</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People are uncomfortable with male vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Be strong, be a man, man up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Be happy with what you have, but don't be too happy. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't mind being strong for others, being a source of protection, but inside I'm just like you. So are your sons and brothers and fathers and uncles.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have to find a good compromise. A way to be true to who we are, and have people's expectations of who we are come closer to the reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/293577557516323&quot;&gt;Original post 11/3/2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Twitter's new API-wall</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about Twitter is they'd let anyone create an &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.twitter.com/&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt;. This has made it possible to build platforms that users can run on their own servers, using Twitter as the identity system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well those days are over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now you have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/02/apply.png&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt; to become a developer. I am trying to complete my application. I have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+twitter+api&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; the Twitter API as long as they've had one. But I'm pretty sure I don't match their idea of what a developer is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Luckily GitHub has as liberal a policy re devs as Twitter used to, and I have been (coincidentally) tooling up for GitHub as a development platform pretty intensely for the last month or so. Good timing I guess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it's a sad moment. I'm guessing this is part of getting control over Russian bots, which is understandable. Maybe what we need is what GitHub is providing. There, the identity system isn't connected to a mass communication system as with Facebook and Twitter. Facebook effectively closed off their API a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: My application was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1058389061583417347&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I checked in with a friend from Berkeley yesterday about stuff I had been writing here. I felt yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/30/174911.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Lakoff, family and framing was kind of a breakthrough. Lakoff's strict father vs nuturing mother, along with my recent realization that we as a society exist in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/29/001342.html&quot;&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt; of abuse. She said something other people have said, she didn't come from an abusive family. I accept that. It's still true that abuse is the context of our lives. It's hidden. Kids are taught to cover for their parents. Yet abuse is viewed, in our discourse, as exceptional. Something that can be fixed by punishing a few people. It's not going to be that easy. Just look at how our political system has embraced not just a strict father, but an abusive one. People voted for him. Not because they're any of the things people say they are. They voted for him because he is, to them, comfortable and trustworthy. Now look at that and tell me abuse isn't the context we live in. It's meant to be a mathematical statement, btw. Not that we chose it, or deserve it. It is what it is.</description>

			<description>I finally found something to buy that I'm genuinely excited about. I keep a second monitor to the left of my main screen. I think of it as a rear-view-mirror in a car. It's where I keep the status readouts, hit counters, server monitors, etc. I watch TV on that monitor (via Spectrum's website). Anyway, the monitor has, until now, been an old Apple screen from 2006 or so. I had bought it to go with my old Mac Pro. That old monitor can't plug into my new iMac Pro. So then I thought, let's buy a new one. Of course monitors have gotten a lot better and cheaper since 2006. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IZBIMLK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;new one&lt;/a&gt; is going to be glorious, or so I think. Should arrive later today via Amazon. Watch this &lt;a href=&quot;#a165259&quot;&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>In April, I set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://newriver5.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;demo river&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting development system for people getting started in Node. They don't charge to run your application, but if it isn't accessed frequently they put it to sleep, and wake it up next time it's accessed. Just for fun I tried installing River5. It works! And even better, here we are six months later, and the app is still running, and doing a great job of getting the news. I would have thoughth it would have to do a scan for new news when I accessed it, but it's been reading news all night. There must be other people using it? Not sure. But it's good. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>An example of framing. People who are anti-abortion say they're &quot;pro-life.&quot; If you're pro-choice you could deny them their framing and call them anti-abortion. (It's more accurate since we're all pro-life. Even people who are pro-choice.) More &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
