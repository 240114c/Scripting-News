			<description>You can see in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/01/radio3List.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; when Facebook turned off the cross-posting API. It's a screen shot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; -- the tool I use for linkblogging. It's amazing this has gotten almost no coverage in the press. It's like a tunnel under the Hudson was terminated, where FB is New Jersey and everything else is Manhattan (or vice versa, it doesn't matter). Only this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/psa-cross-posting-tweets-to-facebook-no-longer-works-as-of-today/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch story&lt;/a&gt;. Update: And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.programmableweb.com/news/facebook-breaks-twitter-feature-changing-its-api/2018/08/01&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on ProgrammableWeb.</description>

			<description>A big downside of ceding economic leadership to China is that their norms of freedom will become the norms of the world. Once Google's search engine &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/&quot;&gt;censors&lt;/a&gt; access to the net in China, it's just a matter of time before they do it in the west too.</description>

			<description>When I moved to California from Madison in 1979, I put together a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf&quot;&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt;, in a manner of speaking, about the work I had been doing on an integrated outliner and database that I build into the UCSD P-System running on top of CP/M on a Cromemco machine. I called the product &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/highFiles.pdf&quot;&gt;HighFiles&lt;/a&gt;, for high level file system. That's how I thought of it. We found a copy of this document in my mom's house back in February. Finally got around to scanning it. It's a time capsule. Some ideas I didn't think I had that early, and some absolute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shaking%20my%20head&quot;&gt;SMH&lt;/a&gt; things, which I'm now putting on the record. I was only 24 back in 1979. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>
