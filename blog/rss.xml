			<description>A number of people in the town where I now live have blogs and do podcasts. It feels weird to me, so far from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Columbus+Cir,+New+York,+NY/@40.7678762,-74.1215993,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258f63c9804b5:0xacca5e3d4112d7eb!8m2!3d40.767848!4d-73.9815219&quot;&gt;center&lt;/a&gt; of civilization, I guess there's a bit of pride, but mostly bewilderment. Like the guy who creates a new computer system in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine&quot;&gt;Soul of  a New Machine&lt;/a&gt; and sees someone using it and thinks you can't use this stuff. Heh. I don't play much of a role in these things anymore. Not sure I'd want to actually, though I think the software most people use for blogging is nowhere near as good or complete as what we had in the early 00s. Just a little factoring and UI reorg would make things flow much better. Podcasting has become a huge undertaking for people, with seasons and episodes, sponsors.  It should be imho like leaving a voice mail to a few friends. Nice thing is today it can easily scale up to millions of friends. That wasn't true at the beginning.</description>

			<description>I had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/sunfrost-farms-woodstock&quot;&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; last week with a new local &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markzip&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; who reads this blog. He's a former DJ at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiowoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;WDST&lt;/a&gt;, and from that he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zipsziggurat.com/&quot;&gt;built&lt;/a&gt; a business selling music at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyrecordfairs.com/&quot;&gt;fairs&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast. He was in the business when Napster rolled through. We shared some interesting stories. I told him what I had been hearing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/local-news/woodstock-site-of-wdst-and-bearsville-theater-sold-to-company/article_24d75aa4-ce5f-11e9-bdd4-db5cb1e71857.html&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/09/06/bearsville-complex-has-a-new-owner/&quot;&gt;sale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bearsvillecenter.com/&quot;&gt;reboot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rhino.com/article/new-this-week-todd-rundgren-the-complete-bearsville-albums-collection&quot;&gt;Bearsville&lt;/a&gt; and Todd Rundgren's old studio and stage. British dude, his sports are rugby and soccer. Not much overlap with this NBA and MLB guy.</description>

			<description>I was hoping podcasting would be more spontaneous and casual, sort of like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O52jAYa4Pm8&quot;&gt;Talking Heads song&lt;/a&gt; that goes like this: &quot;When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed. Say something once, why say it again?&quot; Of course I don't live up to that rule on my own blog. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/kyrie-irvings-volatility-makes-nets-officials-queasy/&quot;&gt;reality of Kyrie&lt;/a&gt; is sinking in for the Nets. I didn't used to care about the Nets, and I still don't, but I wonder why Kyrie thought we would? Their story is only interesting because of the drama. I would have preferred if they grew slowly. New York is a dysfunctional NBA city, btw, in case it wasn't obvious.</description>

			<description>I've been working on an SQL-based RSS &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+river6&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;aggregator&lt;/a&gt; for a while. I just got it working with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/&quot;&gt;managed database&lt;/a&gt; on Digital Ocean. That's a big deal because I don't want to manage databases. Now I don't have to? So far I like it though there were too many hoops to jump through for the setup. A Hello World app for Node with step by step instructions would have helped. Good docs is the thing that sets Digital Ocean apart from AWS. This time I have to say they could be better.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bump&quot;&gt;Robert Occhialini&lt;/a&gt; is restoring his old blog and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bump/status/1189179783722217473&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that one of the only links from November 1997 that still works is the old &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html&quot;&gt;Frontier home page&lt;/a&gt;. That was a good page, a lot of love was poured into it. But there was a broken image, I was immediately sure of the cause. The original server, a Mac, had unicase filenames. It's now hosted on S3 which has case-sensitive file names. So what worked when it was originally posted, now is broken, when served through S3. I guess it must be hard or impossible for S3 to offer unicase for HTTP requests.</description>

			<title>'Lock Him Up' is very American</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of things I've always admired about Cubs fans is that when an opposing team hits a home run, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field&quot;&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt; protocol demands that the fan who caught the ball throw it back on the field. It's a sign of disrespect. Basically fuck you and your home run. In baseball, that's cool. And it is in politics too, to throw back at a president who crosses the line of propriety every waking moment, to throw back at him one of the most vile and disgusting campaign slogans ever, in any political system, anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And last night, the crowd at the World Series game in DC did something most of us would love to do if given the chance. With President Trump in attendance, being called out on the scoreboard, they first booed him and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=world+series+game+5+lock+him+up+2019&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news&amp;iar=news&quot;&gt;chanted&lt;/a&gt; Lock Him Up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a Mets fan of course I don't usually have a lot of sympathy for Nationals fans, but this is bigger than baseball. I love what they did.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lock Him Up should be the chant at every sports event until he is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning on MSNBC we get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-lock-him-up-chants-are-un-american-72161349993&quot;&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt; from Morning Joe and Mika saying you shouldn't do that. And then Senator Chris Coons from Delaware, a Democrat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/467698-democratic-senator-criticizes-crowd-booing-trump-the-office-of-the-president&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the same. Respect the office if you don't respect the person. Well fuck you. We've been very civil through this whole process, and we're fed up. If you respect the office so much, Coons, why do you stand by and let him shit all over it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These people have the wrong idea about who we are. We're not children who are misbehaving. We're the electorate of this country, the ones who elected them, and we're saying if you haven't had enough yet, we have. It's time to do what we sent you there to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much damage is being done to our country while pundits and Democrats worry about which side of the plate the napkin goes. When you get him out of &lt;i&gt;our White House, &lt;/i&gt;we'll stop calling for him to be locked up. Do your jobs and until you take care of this just shut up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that the pundits and pols are making such a big deal about this, it'll be interesting to see what happens Tuesday night in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reaction from pols and pundits reinforces that it would be a good idea to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/21/140215.html&quot;&gt;permanent citizen's occupation&lt;/a&gt; of DC. 100K people, always there, walking up and down the mall chanting &lt;i&gt;Lock Him Up&lt;/i&gt; until the Repubs and Dems and members of the Supreme Court get the idea that the people of the United States are fed up not just with him, but with you too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had a thought early in the Trump presidency that we should offer him a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Art-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0399594493&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt;. He could have $25 billion cash if he resigns immediately. That number goes down by a billion every month he stays. So he would have a very clear picture of how much the misery of being president was costing him. It would be good for us because it's a small amount of money, all things considered, and if we ever elect a president who would take the deal, we would &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; them to take the deal. I would say we could start there right now. Pelosi gets together with Moscow Mitch and visits the White House.</description>

			<description>I hear some Democrats are getting crazy about the choices we have for president. They're trying to think of someone to come in and save the day. They come up with the usuals, Bloomberg, Kerry, even HRC again. But what about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Inslee&quot;&gt;Jay Inslee&lt;/a&gt;, governor of Washington state? Really smart, thinks well on his feet, confident, has executive experience. Republicans would like him.

			<title>Oh Kyrie get over yourself</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/10/25/kyrie-irvings-boldest-knicks-shot-nets-going-to-take-over-the-entire-city/&quot;&gt;Kyrie Irving&lt;/a&gt; doesn't understand NY sports if he thinks the Nets are going to &quot;take over&quot; the city. He shouldn't say stuff like that if it's really his intention. More likely he'll be traded in two years to Chicago as a backup point guard. People will say, &quot;Remember Kyrie Irving? He had such a promising career. What happened to him?&quot; He should remember how NY chews up players who think they're bigger than the city. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let me explain. NY sports fans, except for Yankees fans who they may actually temporarily get a number of because all they care about is winning, suffer for very long periods waiting for their team to rebound. With the Knicks it seems to never happen. But we suffer anyway. We don't want the city to win Kyrie, we want &lt;i&gt;the Knicks&lt;/i&gt; to win. We're tired of people rubbing their shit all over the Knicks. If you want to be loved by the city, and that's where we begin, you have to understand this. We aren't a prize to be won, we're loyalty that must be earned. Over generations. I went to Knicks games with my grandfather. Not much chance my loyalty will ever switch, Kyrie, but if you want my respect, you shouldn't say stupid shit like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing you may not appreciate coming from New Jersey is just how huge the city is. One basketball player, no matter how great he is, cannot conquer the city. Even the Mets in 1969 didn't. For a few days everyone was happy, then life went on. And we don't like arrogant assholes. Unfortunately the Knicks are currently owned by one, but we hope that is just a temporary thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Over the decades I've spun out a number of individual developers from teams I lead. That started when I sold Living Videotext to Symantec in 1987. I left the company a few months after the deal closed. I wasn't smart or patient enough to try to fit into someone else's company, and I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; I really wanted to do. Here's the interesting thing. When I called back the developers I had left behind, and asked if they would collaborate on interop with my new product, they told me how they work for a big company now and can't collaborate with someone like me.

			<source:outline text="Over the decades I've spun out a number of individual developers from teams I lead. That started when I sold Living Videotext to Symantec in 1987. I left the company a few months after the deal closed. I wasn't smart or patient enough to try to fit into someone else's company, and I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; I really wanted to do. Here's the interesting thing. When I called back the developers I had left behind, and asked if they would collaborate on interop with my new product, they told me how they work for a big company now and can't collaborate with someone like me. Heh. I knew that they were working on a project with Apple called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock_(framework)&quot;&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, it happens all the time.

			<description>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterfurnace.com/literature/premier/sp1555.pdf&quot;&gt;geothermal&lt;/a&gt; heating and cooling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterfurnace.com/&quot;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt; that works well, is supposed to be efficient (I haven't used it enough to verify) but there is one thing that sucks about it. When it turns on there's a huge slamming sound. Like a garage door. You can't sleep through it. It's jarring even when you're awake. I get mixed opinions. Some say the loud sound is just the way it works, and others say it's wrong, they have used geothermal systems that worked just like any other forced air heating or cooling system. Anyway I have the problem solved for now, at least in October. I don't turn the heat on. I use a space heater at night, and keep the bedroom door closed. But we haven't had a frost yet. Then I'll &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/winter-storm/frozen-pipes.html&quot;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; another answer.</description>

			<description>I feel sorry for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Engel&quot;&gt;Richard Engel&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC.

Russia moving in to take over from the US is no accident, it was the plan. In America for some reason they don't want to incorporate the obvious fact that Trump works for Russia, not for the United States. Over and over, for years, they pretend they don't know this.

			<description>Reporting on the demonstration put on by Republican House members yesterday, CNN repeated the claim that Repubs were being denied entry to the Shiff hearings. This is why the Repubs do these stunts, because journalism doesn't report the news in a realistic way. The technically correct lead-in would be: &lt;i&gt;Repubs put on a dishonest demo, trying to attract naive press coverage.&lt;/i&gt; Now would be a good time to change the game with Repubs, because they don't have a choice but to accept reasonable rules re lies.</description>

			<description>I'm glad to hear that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1187374005906542592&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; has qualified for the next Democratic debate. I want a candidate that everyone can get behind and that includes Republicans and former Obama voters who voted for Trump. We need a president who wins in a landslide, takes both houses, and someone who knows how to get things done in our political system. When we've elected &quot;outsiders&quot; the results have never been good for us. But Klobuchar's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1187478894045257731&quot;&gt;confidence&lt;/a&gt; isn't there yet. Warren has it, as does Sanders, but neither has the ability to govern with the full support of most Americans. We have to think clearly about how our political system will work after Trump.</description>

			<description>We need a Wikipedia for news. A landing page for each story, with a summary, and pointer to coverage of all major news sites. As they all adopt paywalls I find it's hard to pick a good story to point to from pieces on my blog. Also I don't like pointing to news pages that are overloaded with crapware. Two bits of prior art. &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/&quot;&gt;Political Wire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt;. I like Political Wire's synopses, and Memeorandum's accumulation of links and tweets. Merge those two ideas, and cover more than politics, that's the basic idea. And also use relatively future-safe server tech.</description>

			<description>The Ukrainian government has more backbone and honor than the supposedly honest American press, who were happy to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/29/butHerEmailsYetAgain.png&quot;&gt;throw the election&lt;/a&gt; to Trump for a few bucks.</description>

			<description>After reading about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/191022/p100#a191022p100&quot;&gt;Taylor’s testimony&lt;/a&gt; it’s amazing that there are still people as competent, honest and brave in our government, esp one who was appointed by Pompeo. I was of the belief they had all been removed.</description>

			<description>I may have found a workaround for the problems with Dropbox, but there are still &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1186980696667103234&quot;&gt;outages at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; causing problems elsewhere in Dave's Server Land.

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html&quot;&gt;Dropbox situation&lt;/a&gt; has become more dire. I pretty much have to stop everything and reconceive how I work with my servers from my desktop. Something broke. I may have a workaround. The lesson is that when you depend on other people's tech, at some point it will fail, and then what will you do. It's hard to have a plan for this kind of outage.</description>

			<description>The Atlantic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/10/impeachment-trump-democrats/600448/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dems are not sure what to impeach Trump for. I can't read it because of their paywall, but it's an interesting subject. How about this -- negotiate it privately with McConnell. See if there's anything he could support.</description>

			<description>I think a blog should be like an old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Caen&quot;&gt;Herb Caen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfgate.com/herbcaen/&quot;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; in the SF Chronicle. A goings-on-around-town type flow of mostly gossip. Short items not essays. Caen's first columns were literally &lt;a href=&quot;https://s.hdnux.com/photos/22/45/75/4874108/3/920x920.jpg&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/a&gt;.  I wonder if there are online columnists who use this style. Send pointers if you know of any (I assume there are many).</description>

			<description>One of the best purchases I've ever made -- a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FXN3E74/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Brita water pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. It fits perfectly in the door of a refrigerator. Fill the top with water, put the pitcher in the fridge. It takes a few minutes to filter the water. Next time you want a glass of cold water, just open the fridge and pour a glass. It has no taste. I used to drink bottled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Poland-Springs-Bottled-16-9oz-Bottles/dp/B000CDHZEY/ref=sr_1_8?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrrXtBRCKARIsAMbU6bFGkQ7WYgMn0iV65rGZv2GbbLPiHjaxOhMqy5N7J0XH5J_RPQw0_TAaAgDNEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=282644276296&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023481&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t3&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=11878723364070780002&amp;hvtargid=kwd-325874732562&amp;hydadcr=4414_9619179&amp;keywords=poland+springs+bottled+water&amp;qid=1571692044&amp;s=grocery&amp;sr=1-8&quot;&gt;Poland Springs&lt;/a&gt; water, but I prefer this to the bottles. I still keep some bottled water around for guests.</description>

			<description>Have you noticed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Maddow&quot;&gt;Rachel Maddow&lt;/a&gt; talks about Trump having been impeached, in the past tense. I like it, and I also like that no one challenges her chutzpah. She sometimes says it as part of interviews, in front of guests.</description>
