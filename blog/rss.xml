			<description>Last night on @maddow we learned that the CDC is updating their website without announcements.  Maybe we should have some early warning systems on that -- I bet the search engines know when there's a change on the CDC site.   We could solve this problem.</description>

			<description>Every time I run &quot;npm install,&quot; it reminds me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request has been deprecated&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most ridiculous ideas I've heard.   It's as if the word &quot;the&quot; in the English language were deprecated. Anyway, I wonder if someone has submitted a package to NPM that perfectly emulates request. I predict it would be the most popular package ever.</description>

			<title>We create each other</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1998 I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/01/01/menStaySilent.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about gender and generalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We create each other and together we create the world we live in.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I read that &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigthink.com/sex-relationships/dating-a-psychopath.amp.html&quot;&gt;men with psychopathic traits&lt;/a&gt; are more desirable to women. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every trait in every man was put there by an adult, and a lot of those adults were women. I can't tell you how my personality was molded and shaped by the adult women in the world I grew up in, I wasn't really conscious when it happened, but I'm sure of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm a mirror of them, I am what they saw when they looked at me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read today, from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/annamasera/posts/10217478085568290&quot;&gt;wise woman&lt;/a&gt;, that we will be feeling the reverberations of this period in generations to come. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another wise woman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mayawiley/status/1254080040767229952&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, quoted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/411502-the-great-force-of-history-comes-from-the-fact-that&quot;&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúThe great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I work for Dropbox, cont'd</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning, still fucking around with Dropbox. These things usually end up costing a week of burnout. One of my servers is a place I leave apps I don't use much, but want to still be able to look at. And one or two that are mainstays. Let's say that server is named Alaska. A long time ago Dropbox stopped working on that machine. That made it hard but not impossible for me to update the apps. I have a utility that helps move files from S3 to folders on Alaska. But the data on Alaska is not backed up. So that's a permanent kind of burnout. There is stuff being generated on this server. It would be bad to lose it. Not being backed up. So now I'm trying to resolve that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I could use to help factor out Dropbox, for the backup side of things, is a headless &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/publicFolder/&quot;&gt;Public Folder&lt;/a&gt;. Putting that on the todo list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later: My server karma is low. I can't get Dropbox to install on a fresh Ubuntu server at Digital Ocean. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/169&quot;&gt;Have a look&lt;/a&gt; and tell me what to fix. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even later: I noticed the &quot;Alaska&quot; server (see above) is now updating via Dropbox. One of the million nudges must've worked. Amazing. I have no idea which magic incantation worked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Uncle Ken and Aunt Dorothy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I never really thought of her as an aunt, she and my uncle didn't get married until I was already a teen. I grew up with him, so she was his wife more than an aunt. Ken and Dorothy Kiesler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We called her Little Dot, she liked it, because my grandfather's wife, after he and my grandmother were divorced, was also named Dorothy Kiesler. She was Big Dot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, even more weird, Ken gave himself a name too -- The Great Va Va Voom, professional wrestler. His story was he'd go down to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/crescent-beach-st-augustine-2&quot;&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; near where they lived in Florida and pick up chicks with that line. &quot;Hello ma'am,&quot; he'd say, as the story goes, &quot;I am the The Great Va Va Voom, professional wrestler, at your service.&quot; Of course nothing like that actually ever happened. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ken had one of the very first blogs, along with Dan Gillmor at the SJ Mercury. He was living in Jamaica at the time. We even got him his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;own domain&lt;/a&gt;, which I still maintain for him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He and Dot were married for about 25 years, and in that time, the were together every day except two weeks every summer when Ken went to NYC. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this picture, I'd say Ken and Dot look like they're in their 30s or early 40s -- if so this picture would be from the mid-late 70s? All the cars in the picture were Ken's, and the boat. He loved to work on cars. He built the house they lived in, and a windmill, solar heat, pioneered growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cannareps.ca/sinsemilla-origins-of-modern-cannabis/&quot;&gt;seedless pot&lt;/a&gt;, all without being on the electric grid. They had no phone, and this was long before cell phones. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ken and Dorothy Kiesler at their house in Florida, mid-late 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were hippies, refugees from the East Village, living off the land in northeast Florida. I went there a lot when I was in college at Tulane and later Wisconsin. Ken and I used to hang out a lot, he was definitely family, but he was also a friend. Dot died in the late 80s, and Ken in 2003, both of them way too young.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crescent+Beach,+FL+32080/@29.7536312,-81.2730914,302m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e69977c882aea5:0xe61a1afbdfe01fae!8m2!3d29.76886!4d-81.2536786&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; their house was, but there was only a dirt road going in there back then, and no services. They owned 25 acres, most of it undeveloped. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.kinsahealth.com/products/kinsa-quickcare?__hstc=189353844.c9aa4b08387ebae2142dbe354583d557.1584992554446.1586723447049.1588000860851.4&amp;__hssc=189353844.2.1588000860851&amp;__hsfp=1613160091&quot;&gt;Kinsa thermometer&lt;/a&gt; on April 14, almost two weeks ago. I've gotten in the habit of taking my temperature at the beginning and end of every day. I feel like I'm doing my part to support an early warning system. I just noticed they have a way to export your data. I was hoping it would be a nice XML or JSON format, but it's a log file format. Not sorted by anything I can see. I don't have any code that can process this format. But it was there, and that's worth something. I'd give it a B-, but most apps don't give you a way to export your own data, and for that, A+. Also, they should change their store from saying it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/27/kinsaPreOrderNot.png&quot;&gt;pre-order&lt;/a&gt; -- there's nothing &lt;i&gt;pre&lt;/i&gt; about it. You can buy it. It takes a few weeks to get there because the product is so popular.</description>

			<description>I recently found out there was a season 3 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos_(season_3)&quot;&gt;Narcos&lt;/a&gt;. Wow. That goes on my list. Also, I thought this season was the last for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul_(season_5)&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine my surprise when I got to the end, and nothing was resolved. Okay, I'd better survive this virus thing so I can find out what happens to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalo_Salamanca&quot;&gt;Lalo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a32248797/better-call-saul-stars-why-kim-isnt-in-breaking-bad/&quot;&gt;Kim&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Dropbox, LO2 outage</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a pretty terrible &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/24/171231.html?title=dropboxIsKillingItself&quot;&gt;Dropbox outage&lt;/a&gt; here since Friday, but with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Stuck-on-quot-upgrading-dropbox-quot/m-p/414171/highlight/false#M92358&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt; from Daniel Bradley, I was able to get most of my servers connected to Dropbox again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just noticed that the server for &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; got completely trashed in the process. I have no idea how, but I had a backup from yesterday, which I am now restoring. It may take about an hour or so. Any work done between the outage and the restoration will be lost. Sorry. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to have to stop depending on Dropbox. Obviously the Linux version is not a priority for them, it's breaking a lot these days. I've been a Dropbox user since the beginning. But it's been obvious for a few years that this is no longer a good match. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: Well that was pretty good &lt;a href=&quot;#a182141&quot;&gt;outage&lt;/a&gt;-wise. Less than 15 minutes. But data &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; lost. It seems fortunate this happened after I added the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1586885920000&quot;&gt;backup&lt;/a&gt; command. No excuse for not having copies of your files. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I write posts to solicit info from my brain trust, the people who read my blog. Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/25/163108.html?title=whenWillThereBeAVaccine&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the non-inevitablity of a Covid-19 vaccine, and got two interesting responses. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From correspondent #1&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;HIV has a very high mutation rate, it's a constantly changing target, very hard to vaccinate. Fortunately this corona virus is highly conserved (stable), there are many stable proteins you can target. We don't see a reason why that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2012889?query=featured_coronavirus&quot;&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; would change as it's already spread around the world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From correspondent #2&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to offer a few reasons for limited, cautious optimism, and one reason for a little bit of pessimism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nobody ever &quot;gets better&quot; from HIV on their own. Our immune systems can't beat it. So it's hard to make a vaccine that teaches our immune systems how to beat it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We do get better from the flu on our own. But the problem is that the flu is a &quot;modular&quot; virus that can be recombined, so there's always a new version. So flu vaccines work, but there's a new vaccine every year.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Our bodies can beat the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. People usually get better in a few weeks, if they don't die.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Many people who caught the original SARS-CoV virus in 2003 still had antibodies ~10 years later.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The SARS viruses are unusually complex, and in order to replicate correctly, they have pretty good proofreading. So they mutate much more slowly than HIV or the flu.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But there's also one reason to worry:&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are four other coronaviruses that cause about 15% of cases of the common cold. We build immunity to these viruses but it usually doesn't last forever.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So as I understand it, the biggest question with SARS-CoV-2 isn't whether we can teach our bodies to beat it. It's how long our immune system will remember. And whether we can find a low-risk vaccine that doesn't cause other problems.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As always, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; readers are the smartest and best. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üöÄ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>NYC a long time ago</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A picture rescued from Facebook. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompkins_Square_Park&quot;&gt;Tompkins Square Park&lt;/a&gt; in NYC.&lt;br&gt;From left to right, my uncle, Ken Kiesler, his friend Sparky, my grandfather &lt;a href=&quot;http://rudykiesler.com/&quot;&gt;Rudy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;, and me. I'm guessing this is 1989 or 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Elizabeth Warren for VP</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Biden should pick &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; for VP.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She'd put Repubs on notice. Biden is a nice guy but Warren knows you suck. Good cop bad cop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A black woman? The best candidate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters&quot;&gt;Maxine Waters&lt;/a&gt;, isn't in contention.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's win, not just the election but the politcal war that will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I supported Biden over Warren after Klobuchar dropped out. I want a president that is uncontentious, for everyone. A unifier. It's the only way out of the paralysis imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I want everyone to understand the unity has as its foundation care for the American people. That's what Warren is for. No one can misunderstand what that choice means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>When will there be a vaccine?</title>

That would mean there would be no Covid-19 vaccine in 2056.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Something to think about and ponder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also there's another apocalypse lurking in the shadows, other than climate change. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/about/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html&quot;&gt;Antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yeah science is a bitch. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And now everyone is looking. And day after day of idiot lectures and babbles incoherently. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then he talks about injecting bleach in your veins. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How much more of this could we possibly take. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/24/171026.html?title=aMilestoneInAmericanJournalism&quot;&gt;the NYT can't see both sides&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Something broke there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>More men die from Covid than women. Older people and people with other problems like heart disease, diabetes, hypertension make up a large share of the deaths. From that, we conclude that people in these groups are more likely to die than not if they get the virus. But that's not a logical inference. I'd love to hear the numbers expressed the other way. If you have some or all of these conditions, and you get the disease, what's the probability that you will die.</description>

			<title>Dropbox is killing itself</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Dropbox on Linux appears to be killing itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I do a &quot;dropbox status&quot; from the command line, it says: &quot;Upgrading Dropbox...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It never stops trying to upgrade itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It isn't syncing while supposedly upgrading. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Upgrading+Dropbox...%22&amp;t=hy&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;searched&lt;/a&gt; and on various support boards that this has been happening for years for others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems I spend a week every few months nursing Dropbox back to health, usually by lopping off big pieces of my Dropbox archive. It might be time to try something new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A milestone in American journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The NYT isn't punting on whether drinking or injecting poison is bad for a human. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1253719616603541504&quot;&gt;taking a stand&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There aren't two sides to that, per the NYT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No he-said-she-said. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not subject to alternate facts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; agree to disagree. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am not being sarcastic. This is how bad it has been. They've accepted as reality lies that have cost us dearly. Two sides to ridiculous things that are not two-sided. Finally they have been pushed to the brink of their cowardice by a psychotic president who insists that ingesting random poisons could cure a person of the disease caused by the pandemic that is consuming our country. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NYT and Trump were in perfect sync on the possibility of this idea being true until now. Let's hope they come to their senses and start showing a bit of the courage and integrity that they take so much credit for having. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Times takes a stand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Walking on country roads</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In the country north of NYC where I now live, we're seeing an influx of city folk, staying at their summer homes or using AirBnB's or whatever. And of course they're getting out and walking on our beautiful roads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But some of them bring their aggressive city walking habits with them, something I'm very familiar with because I also know how to walk &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/11/27.html#a203503&quot;&gt;in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, learned the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are some common-sense rules for walking on country roads.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Wear a mask.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Walk on the side of the road, not in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Pick a side of the road to walk on and stick with it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're in a group of say four people, don't walk four-across. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Leave room for people to pass you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remember cars and bikes use country roads too. :-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If someone is walking faster, as they approach (assuming you hear them) slow down a little, or stop, to make the passing faster. Stay slow until they are a few yards ahead, so you minimize the breathing their exhaled viruses. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I offer this advice because a few people are walking like there is no pandemic and their breath is free of virus and they're assuming so is everyone else's. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Working my way through the last season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;. It's great, but the most striking thing are the ads. When the first show aired, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/23.html&quot;&gt;February 23&lt;/a&gt;, there was no awareness of the virus in advertising. As the season progressed, at times I forgot I was watching something from nine weeks ago. An ad for a bank that has turned itself into a coffee shop. Whoa that's optimistic, I thought to myself, and then realized this was the old reality. The full series makes a very interesting window into the transition our culture is making. I'm reminded of when my mom died, we didn't do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/04.html#a070909&quot;&gt;video walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; of the house we grew up in. Didn't think of it, because it seemed normal to be there, not realizing soon this would all be gone, and in the future it would be anything but normal. Now we're repeating it on a much much larger scale. When this show turns up on Netflix it won't have the ads, and we'll miss the transition, which is in every way as interesting as the show, which as I said is fantastic.</description>

			<description>Ever notice how I put images in the right margin of posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;? That tradition goes all the way back to the mid-90s. I'm always looking for evocative images that aren't too large, that have empty backgrounds. Imagine how happy I was when I discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psddd.co/free-web-font-people-silhouettes/&quot;&gt;Wee People font&lt;/a&gt;. A collection of silhouettes of people gesturing in easily identified ways. I admit I'm making this post extra long so there's room to put one of the images in the right margin. Please forgive me. Now I wonder which one I should use? Let's see. How about a person of indeterminate gender talking on a phone?</description>

			<title>More science in the news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Petitions don't work for politics, but they may work for media. If I started a petition to ask CNN and MSNBC to limit Trump coverage to 1 hour per night, would you sign it? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think MSNBC and CNN should stop focusing on Trump so much. There's so much news that we need to know. Wouldn't it be better to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Laurie_Garrett&quot;&gt;Laurie Garrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; on every night? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If science and medicine are so important, why not more science and medicine on TV. I've started watching CNN more because they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Gupta&quot;&gt;Sanjay Gupta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes we know Trump screwed up in the first part of 2020, but he's still screwing up. What should we do now? I know testing, testing, testing, but that's like saying baseball, baseball, baseball. The way we test, what we test for, that's something people should learn about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Coverage of the outbreaks should be like weather reporting. The more we know, and the more we see progress being made, the more hope can take over from fatalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see journalism as starting to separate from Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I predict that on the day he resigns in disgrace it will not be the #1 story of the day. Probably won't even be #2. That gives an idea of how much we have to change the focus to news that really matters not the latest fake controversy Trump offers us to distract from our future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was going to write a bit about Kobol vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/wheres-my-check-cobol-unemployment-and-taxes/&quot;&gt;COBOL&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient programming language which is in the news these days. Kobol is the homeworld of the Twelve Colonies in Battlestar Galactica. I've watched the full series twice. But the synopsis on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; is riveting. I often forget how simple and beautiful the overall structure of the plot is. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/21/bsgplot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spSpoiler&quot;&gt;BSG plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And of course the execution. I'd have to say, even though it has cheezy sets and special effects, it's pretty much a perfect multi-part scifi drama. I just watched The Expanse, which is also good, but BSG is still tops with me.</description>

			<description>I took a survey class in programming languages in grad school, and COBOL was of course one of them. It was in the mid-late 70s when people were still creating new systems in COBOL. It was one of the first attempts to make programming like English instead of like programming, so managers could do it, you wouldn't need programmers. To anyone who really knew about programming, it was obvious that this would not work. People would want features for which there were no human language equivalents, like looping and recursion, nesting, local variables, procedures, closures, objects, async, etc etc. We keep discovering new concepts for which you can't say &quot;this is just like..&quot; COBOL may have been the first programming language to reject programming, but it was not the last. Later attempts include Hypercard and AppleScript. I'm sure there were many others. I've always been most comfortable with Algol-like languages, C, Pascal, JavaScript. My own invented language, UserTalk, is Algol-like. There is a grammar somewhere for UserTalk. I'll find it later. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üöÄ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>The ebb and flow of lockdown</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The way we're going to fight the virus is like levels in video games. You don't get to move on to the next level until you've mastered the previous. And when you fall down, you go back to the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This narrative comes from listening to expert explainers on MSNBC last night, mainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/the-pandemics-path/&quot;&gt;Laurie Garrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;, who was also yesterday's guest on the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;Daily&lt;/a&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, establish strategic testing. Do statistical sampling to form virus outbreak &quot;weather reports,&quot; like tracking tornados. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you are in an area where there aren't active outbreaks, you can do a covid-aware resumption of business. Strict limits on size and density of gatherings, so new outbreaks, which will happen, are limited. Makes contact tracing possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Where there are outbreaks, do intense contact tracing. Full lockdown except for essential services. Locate people who are infected, and isolate with other spreaders, not with their families. Until the outbreak subsides, then go to 2. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The testing is never of the whole population, always sampled, and to support contact tracing. Testing forms the basis for the weather reports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are going to get very good at all this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NateSilver538&quot;&gt;Nate Silver&lt;/a&gt; can explain better and in more detail. This is similar to what they do at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/politics/&quot;&gt;538&lt;/a&gt; to predict election outcomes. It's also similar to what they do with TV program ratings for advertising, and gathering meteorological data to support weather forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Chuck Shotton suggested I look at the Node package &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/require-from-string&quot;&gt;require-from-string&lt;/a&gt; as a good basis for plugins for Node apps. I had done &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md&quot;&gt;something similar&lt;/a&gt; with plain old require. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/3e5454f2b7a10029dfc301d7deabb576&quot;&gt;Hello World app&lt;/a&gt; I wrote to get an idea how I might use it.</description>
