			<description>I think there should be a panel of tech security experts who keep track of security concerns in the 2018 election. Otherwise the press is going to mangle the story, the way they did with HRC's email server in the 2016 election.</description>

			<title>Silos vs decentralized networks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1028630757856751616&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Johannes Ernst is smart and brave. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://upon2020.com/blog/2018/08/why-decentralized-social-networking-never-makes-it-ever-heard-of-crossing-the-chasm/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; decentralized networks never make it, and there are reasons for this. I agree, in a way, but ultimately think his theory is wrong. Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+decentralized&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;decentralized&lt;/a&gt; networks have blossomed and survived, and imho will still be operating when the silos are gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Consider the case of RSS vs Twitter. When Twitter came along it grew fast, it overtook RSS. It didn't do away with RSS, because it's still here co-existing with Twitter. It still has advantages over Twitter. Richer data. Extensibility. Podcasting. Titles. Styling. Multiple links per item. No character limit. If RSS has so much going for it, why did Twitter surpass it? Not for any of the reasons Johannes cites. Imho it was because subscribing was done with a single click. That could have been done with RSS too, in fact we had it working in our own RSS network at UserLand, we called it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/macros/xmlCoffeeMug&quot;&gt;coffee mug&lt;/a&gt;. One click to subscribe. it could have become a universal one-click subscribe, if our competitors were willing to go along with UserLand's leadership, but they weren't. One  click to subscribe was an important survival trait in the Darwinian ecosystem of online social nets. Twitter had it, RSS didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Johannes mentions two other features: trending topics and search. I guess he's right about trending topics, but the feature has no value for me, it's there on the Twitter screen, but I never look at it. For search, it's been proven that search works well on distributed networks. Google is a good example. There's no reason an equivalent search function couldn't be created for blogs or feeds, in fact last week I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/09/141354.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about features that would make search much better for distributed systems. All are technologically possible and none are implemented on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will come a time when Twitter shuts down. But it's hard to imagine that day coming for the network of RSS feeds. It's been wishful thinking for TechCrunch and the VCs and BigCos they serve, a kind of wet dream that open systems will bend to the will of tech titans, that vast wealth is what makes the nets work, but it hasn't happened, even though they've been reporting its demise for a decade now. Really it has been that long! You can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/reader/about/&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; the beating heart of the RSS network, and it routes around the damage, quickly.  (A corollary to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Gilmore&quot;&gt;Gilmore's Law&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why Mastodon didn't use RSS, I think they should have. Then the power of the two open distirbuted nets would combine, there would be more interfaces, greater know-how among developers, and more choice for users. I have to dig into it. I think Johannes' theory depends on using Mastodon as the counter-example to Twitter, because while Mastodon is strong and growing, it hasn't withstood the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/30/rssOnTheDesktop15YearsLater.html&quot;&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; that RSS has. I suspect it will. And I also suspect it will still be running when Twitter is gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate his post, no sarcasm. It's great when we step outside the silos and use our own disparate tools to discourse about things that matter.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I got an email in the middle of the night asking if I had seen an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.harvard.edu/blog/2018/07/13/upcoming-changes/&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; from Berkman Center at Harvard that they will stop hosting blogs.harvard.edu. It's not clear what will happen to the archives. Let's have a discussion about this. That was the first academic blog hosting system anywhere. It was where we planned and reported on our Berkman Thursday meetups, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;. It's where the first podcasts were hosted. When we tried to figure out what makes a weblog a weblog, that's where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html&quot;&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; was posted. There's a lot of history there. I can understand turning off the creation of new posts, making the old blogs read-only, but as a university it seems to me that Harvard should have a strong interest in maintaining the archive, in case anyone in the future wants to study the role we played in starting up these (as it turns out) important human activities.</description>

			<description>I just looked for some of the old 2003-2004 sites, and they're already gone. Earlier this year we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/204408.html&quot;&gt;lost the handle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio-weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; weblogs because the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com/about.html&quot;&gt;new owner&lt;/a&gt; of weblogs.com was unwilling to maintain a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;DNS entry&lt;/a&gt; pointing to them. That and Google's marking HTTP sites as &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;not secure&lt;/a&gt; have been huge blows to the web as an archival medium. It's a good time to pause and reflect on the question of what was the value of all the work, and why bother continuing if the people who should care, a major university, a large research company and one of the largest tech companies, don't care about maintaining the web. What hope is there for it being maintained in the future?</description>

			<description>We had a thunderstorm in Manhattan last night. It woke me up and I was in a foul mood, as I sometimes am when I wake up in the middle of the night. The lightning and thunder scared me. First time that ever happened. My mind started playing games. I imagined the flash of lightning was a nuclear weapon detonating, and the thunder was the wave of destruction. It's a good approximation of the time it would take between the flash and death. Great move, I said to my mind. Now I'm even more scared and sad. Eventually I fell back asleep, but it wasn't a good sleep.</description>

			<description>Journalists think Twitter stands out as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://amp.poynter.org/news/whats-matter-twitter&quot;&gt;bad tech company&lt;/a&gt;, I think the opposite. Their unwillingness to follow the herd is a sign of hope that we may continue to use the net to speak freely, even if the majority wants us silenced. And what does it say about journalism that there are few if any dissenters? You see this regularly, they’re too scared for some reason to present all sides of a discussion. It’s amazing at times, the way they form herds.</description>

			<description>Writing in the age of silos. After their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/01.html#a022140&quot;&gt;August 1&lt;/a&gt; change, I can't cross-post to Facebook. So if I want to speak to people I know on Facebook, I have to write on Facebook. Today if I want to even post a link, I have to do it by hand. And Twitter, new forms of writing have developed there to work around the 280-char limit. Again, if I want to write for people I know there, I have to write it there. This is what always happens with corporate platforms, they become silos. Maybe they start with good intentions, on FB, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ogp.me/&quot;&gt;open graph&lt;/a&gt;, with Twitter their API, but over time, they evolve to become their own completely self-contained very unweblike worlds. You can see that evolution in action today, at a super-high pace. For me this is the Nth time around this loop, so I have an idea what to expect next.</description>

			<title>Smarter search for the open web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Three ideas for making the open web, and blogging, more valuable and interesting, by building a search engine for the next decade, not for two decades ago. Sorry Google, your search engine is showing serious signs of age and boredom. We can do so much better. Here are the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I just pointed to a post written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://davisshaver.com/&quot;&gt;Davis Shaver&lt;/a&gt;. A nice database would note that, and create a link between his blog and mine. I could ask for a list of all the blogs that I've pointed to, and that would become my blogroll. Lots more ideas after that esp if the blogs are willing to share data with the centralized resource.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You know how the index in the back of a book works? Topics, sub-topics, and lists of pages that those topics are discussed on. 99 percent of the searches I do on my own blog are really just navigations of this structure. Search engine technology is getting smart enough to recognize not just words but concepts. How about a service that sucked down all the content of my blog and created the back-of-book index of my writing. Realtime. Updated every time I post something new or modified an existing post. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A search engine that knows I'm a blogger and where my blog is, and uses all the info it can glean from that to give me more relevant searches. For example, when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Frontier&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for Frontier, esp if the first letter is capitalized, what kind of cockamamie search engine &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/09/searchForFrontier.png&quot;&gt;shows me&lt;/a&gt; the airline? I'm obviously referring to the scripting environment I developed and worked on for a couple of decades, and still to this day use every freaking day. Google started out ridiculously smart, but it never figured this part out (or #2 above). It's been stagnant for too long. They clearly need some competition. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, Google knows I'm the &quot;owner&quot; of this blog, they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/06/21/googleEmail.png&quot;&gt;threaten me&lt;/a&gt; as such. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>xkcd's &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/2030/&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; for today is right on. I’m a software developer and I concur. We throw out our base technology every few years and start over, leaving the stuff that’s already deployed hard to evolve or fix, and the latest stuff full of bugs, and long before it’s mature and reliable we do it all over again.</description>

			<description>I commented in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1027177850754027521&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter on the controversy re the recent hire by the NYT editorial board and sweeping comments she made previously about white men. I am responding to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/8/8/17661368/sarah-jeong-twitter-new-york-times-andrew-sullivan&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Ezra Klein in Vox. I waited a few days for the furor to die down, and to try to say thoughtfuly and carefully how I as a man feel about such statements. Klein had said, for the first time I can recall for a reporter, how he feels about these things. I'll let the comments speak for themselves now.</description>

			<description>The other day I spilled a bottle of water on my keyboard, and have been limping along waiting for a new keyboard to arrive. I am now using it. This time I decided not to opt for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DPF08E/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt; Apple keyboard, instead I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077926YZQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Macally keyboard&lt;/a&gt; which cost a fraction of what the Apple one did. So far it seems quite nice. My fingers need to set up in a different place, and the keyboard doesn't have lifters at the top to put it at an angle, but I'm already getting used to it. Unfortunately the modifier keys &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/08/kbControlPanel.png&quot;&gt;control panel&lt;/a&gt; isn't working, not sure why. Might have to reboot the system? I usually don't like doing that. And then as if by magic it started working! I like to map Control to Command and vice versa. My brain was trained by many years of using Windows, a long time ago.</description>

It's not at all surprising that when a tech company hijacks an incomprehensibly huge, world wide platform that's been growing uncontrollably for 25 years, they might overlook some huge applications thereof, and in plotting a transition break the installed base. It's completely foreseeable.

Which is why we don't let private companies hijack public resources if we have our heads screwed on straight, which we clearly do not. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 07 Aug 2018 18:28:09 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/07/mrWhiteBreakingBadActionFigure.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/08/07.html#a182809"/>

He's the only person in my family who would have posed for a picture that way.</description>

			<description>I fixed a serious startup bug in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/03/144422.html&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of LO2. Thanks to Steve Hooker for finding and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/91#issuecomment-410838712&quot;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; it. Now would be a great time for people to try the &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/testing/1.8.0/&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt;. I'd like to put it to bed and move on to other projects next week. Thanks! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Reporter vs Journalist</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've written here many times about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/03/whyBloggingIsAnAmateurThing.html&quot;&gt;distinction&lt;/a&gt; between the terms blogger and journalist. In a Twitter thread, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lorakolodny&quot;&gt;Lora Kolodny&lt;/a&gt; makes a distinction between &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lorakolodny/status/1026499041792647168&quot;&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lorakolodny/status/1026499347763027968&quot;&gt;reporter&lt;/a&gt;. I hadn't realized there might be a difference. Here's what she says.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journalist&lt;/i&gt; (besides sounding hi-falutin) includes people who aren't reporters. Editors, producers, photographers, columnists, podcasters, vloggers and bloggers may not all be doing the primary research or interviews for a piece, but are all responsible for accuracy of it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reporters&lt;/i&gt; do the primary fact finding, interviews, field work, etc. But by no means are reporters the only journalists. It's not a commutative property. If reporter then journalist. But not if journalist then reporter.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My own two cents. I'd love to reserve the term blogger for people who write about their own experiences, not for pay, the &quot;unedited voice of a person.&quot; I think of bloggers as sources in the journalism world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Succession</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spoilers ahead, you have been warned! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had been hearing good things about the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; so I chose it for my next binge. I made it all the way to the next to last episode about an hour before the finale aired last night, but waited till the morning to watch it. I wasn't prepared for how disturbing it would be. I wasn't expecting it to be so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think perhaps it was so disturbing because the Roy family reminds me of my own family. All the disconnects, vanity, foolish sense of self-importance. And the prohibition on every talking about it realistically. These were all big features of my upbringing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They really play with you. At times it's so funny, it seems like a comedy, but then, in the next episode, it knocks you down. That's what the finale was like. Complete knock down, with the tour de force in the very last scene. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best line delivered by the patriarch's latest wife to one of the adult children: &quot;He built you a playground and you think it's the world.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of self-awareness in the last episode, but mostly they avoid living their own lives, all of them, including the all-powerful father. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On reflection, the Roy family is not like my family, where the women fought, and the men, while they often roared, were mostly sidelined, not the main act. I guess when you participate in something so intensely for so many hours your subconscious starts accepting it as real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time recommending Succession. It's very well done. But hard to watch at times, it's so awkward and the people are such fools. And it's very disturbing, that gives it value, at least for me. As art, it's outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think it's time to start teaching regular people to do journalism. A civic thing, like jury duty. Every college grad should take a semester of journalism. It's a very important skill to at least appreciate, if not practice.</description>

			<description>I definitely don't want to be part of the debate about whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+racism&quot;&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt; can apply to white people. The dictionary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+racism&quot;&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt; seems to imply it can. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+sexism&quot;&gt;Sexism&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand gives preference to women, but doesn't disallow sexism with men as the target. There's a lot of ridiculous gymnastics used to justify some pretty awful things said that should simply be retracted and apologized for.  One thing is very clear, it's possible to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+abusive&quot;&gt;abusive&lt;/a&gt; without being either sexist or racist. And a lot of what passes for satire is imho abuse. We need a broad, simple, respectful, adult and professional code of conduct on Twitter, and we should have an amnesty for all past sins, and then set about solving problems working together, instead of having these ridiculous fights over who has the right to say what.</description>

			<description>It would be interesting, as an experiment, to see a Democrat run for governor or senator and directly ask for Republican votes. &quot;We're really all conservatives now, in that we'd like to turn the clock back to when the US was a world leader and respected itself.&quot;</description>

			<title>Little Outliner v1.8.0 testing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/testing/1.8.0/&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of LO2 is ready for testing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've completed most of the features planned for this release, so it's a good time for people who'd like to help to start using the new version. I've made a backup of all the outlines, in case there are any data-losing bugs in the software. I don't think there are, because I've used it myself fairly thoroughly, and there aren't many changes to the core outliner in this release. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you encounter any problems or have questions, please post an item in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/91&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; on the Scripting News repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick list of the new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hoisting. There are two new commands in the Outliner menu, Hoist and Dehoist, and two icons in the sidebar, the two pushpins. The commands and pushpins are enabled when the operations are possible. For example, you can only hoist if a headline has subs. You can only dehoist if something is hoisted. You can nest hoists. As far as I know there is no limit to the number of levels. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The crumbtrail. At the top of the outline display is the crumb trail that leads back to the summit from the location of the bar cursor. You can click on any of the links to move the cursor back to that spot. The navigation undoes hoists if necessary. It's a good way to keep track of your context while you're focusing on a specific part of your outline.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The SAVED/NOT SAVED indicator. LO2 automatically saves your work. You can keep track of that by watching this indicator, just above the tabs, in the right margin. You may find it reassuring to know that your work is saved. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgsMANmu9qo&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Integrated thesaurus. To start navigating the thesaurus, enter a word in a headline, click the suitcase icon and add a &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; attribute with the value word. Expand it the headline, and synonyms for the word, if any can be found, will fill in as subheads. Then you can expand any of its subheads to find synonyms. It is the basic functionality of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/&quot;&gt;thesaurus.land&lt;/a&gt; application, integrated in LO2.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Known problems&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are problems with hoisting in readonly outlines. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Conspiracy theories</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Stan Krute on Facebook wrote how astonished he is about conspiracy theories that real people believe in. I wrote a series of three comments, which I've included here, lightly edited.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My uncle, well educated, highly literate, creative, believed lots of conspiracy theories, and the people he hung out with did too. I believed a few myself when I was younger. So I have some familiarity with it. I think it’s a way of coping with the complexity and dishonesty of everything.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My parents too, when it came to Israel, had lots of what I considered irrational conspiracy like beliefs. Also very literate, highly educated, urban, liberal people.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Eventually as I grew older I got closer to the real power in the world, and understood that it’s just as confusing to the people at the top as it is to the people on the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
