			<description>We should make a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/virus/whatShouldBeClosed.opml&quot;&gt;list of activities&lt;/a&gt; that should come to a stop now. For example, movie theaters are done. In-person sports events. Offices, schools, mass transit.

			<description>Think about it this way. What if you got a 2-week advance notice that something really shitty was about to happen, and you actually know a lot about what will happen. I listened to a podcast with an expert on this stuff, and he said we got lucky this time. Imagine that. We got lucky, weird, but yes we did.</description>

			<description>This is how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mir_ocall/status/1237278605866151941&quot;&gt;Italian quarantine&lt;/a&gt; works. &quot;People can leave their homes to get to and from work, a health appointment, family necessity such as food shop. Otherwise stay inside. If kids are going stir crazy they can be taken for walk. But no gatherings of people.&quot;</description>

			<title>Morning tweets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our friends in Italy are telling us we should learn from their experience and use the couple of weeks extra time we have to prepare. They appear to be doing this in Washington state. But not so much here in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Those who survive the virus will have to live in its aftermath. The economy is going to stop like the economy in New Orleans did after Katrina. One of the big lessons of Katrina was that once stopped, it takes a long time for an economy to reboot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not blaming gov Cuomo. People have to be mobilized.  They're mobilized in Wash because they have the biggest outbreak in the US so far. And we are soft in the west, we can't imagine things being not-normal.   People in New Orleans however I'm sure are aware of the hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must play hold music make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc&quot;&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When last night's email went out, it sent Saturday's posts, not Sunday's. This is pretty hard to debug, I'd have to recreate the conditions of various databases at midnight last night. At first I thought the problem must be related to the Daylight Savings Time switch on Saturday night, but on second thought, how could it? It doesn't really seem likely. And the relevant machines auto-updated their clocks. So for now, I'm going to wait to see what happens tonight. If the right stuff goes out, then I'll just call it an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case&quot;&gt;edge case&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray&quot;&gt;cosmic rays&lt;/a&gt; (programmerese for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_God&quot;&gt;Act of God&lt;/a&gt;) and move on.</description>

			<description>Back in the world of the mundane, recall that I've had a problem with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html&quot;&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27/191010.html&quot;&gt;deliveries&lt;/a&gt; for a while, so I was amazed today when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/09/upsTruck.png&quot;&gt;UPS truck showed up&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>A simple idea. We need testing of the Covid-19 virus. More testing is better -- and sooner. The US government isn't moving fast enough. Maybe Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple could get together to help us get tested, and then help scientists learn as much about where we're at as soon as possible. We need a Manhattan project, and it seems the capabilities of the tech industry would be well-applied here.</description>

			<title>Notes on Covid-19</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;These ideas are going to seem horribly naive in a few days probably, but based on lots of reading and listening this is what I think. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until there is massive testing we can't know where the virus is. Assuming it's everywhere is better than assuming it's nowhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emergency.yale.edu/be-prepared/shelter-place&quot;&gt;Shelter in place&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;Self-quarantine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The reason to self-quarantine is two-fold. 1. To minimize the chance that you get the virus and 2. to slow its transmission. It uses our bodies to get to other bodies. If we don't have it, we can't transmit it. If we do, if we don't move around we can't transmit it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Only go out to get food and other supplies, and to work if you can. That's an ideal of course, not achievable in most countries, esp not the US, which doesn't have health care for all, or paid sick leave, or for that matter a functioning government.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hope that essential services can be maintained, electric, water, the supply chain for food, health care. Expect lots of outages. Hope is really all we have at this point when it comes to maintaining our way of life. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the government can't implement massive testing, we have to do it. We'll need excellent data management functions so we can do all kinds of queries on the data, to determine what comes next. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to say this, we should get Trump out of the loop of this, he's much more lethal than the virus. The government that comes after Trump, hopefully very soon, must implement a TARP-like program to vastly expand health care funding and funneling money to people who can't go to work because they have the virus, to help slow transmission. Also to parents who have to stay home to take care of kids who aren't going to school. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The rate cut by the Fed was insane btw, if we get out of this, we're going to need the ability to drop interest rates to stimulate the economy (experience from Katrina, a stopped economy is slow to restart). The rate cut can't do anything to stimulate an economy that is coming to a halt for non-market reasons. If people have more money in their pocket (they won't but if they did) they aren't going to go to Walmart to buy a new fridge and risk getting a virus that might kill them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Went grocery shopping today. Found it impossible not to put my fingers in my mouth when trying to open the plastic bags for fruit and produce. Touching all kinds of surfaces that probably are infected. The place had a Thanksgiving-like feel to it. Could just be a Friday thing in late winter. I've been stocking up on canned goods. I buy about twice as much as I need every week. Also noted there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/06/plentyOfToiletPaperInHannafords.png&quot;&gt;plenty of toilet paper&lt;/a&gt; on the shelves. Apparently people here aren't so scared of running out. The only thing that was in short supply was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/home&quot;&gt;Bread Alone&lt;/a&gt; bread, for some reason. I should've asked. It looks like they're not going to carry it in the future? That would be not good.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1235645351668764673&quot;&gt;Asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: I have a Mac and an iPhone. What's the best way to get a text file from my Mac onto my iPhone. Best == least work. Lots of answers. The thing I like about email the best is that the same approach works from a browser-based app like &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. I can add email capabilities there so I can make a list in the outliner and email it to my phone. That will be beautiful.</description>

			<description>We will look back at March 2020 as the good old days when the virus was more or less contained. Will we ever get back to this level again of containment?

			<title>Non-disclosure agreements</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was CEO of a small Silicon Valley company in the 1980s. Even back then, lawyers were advising companies to settle with employees who made claims, even when the company had done nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's why. Lawyers are expensive, as are trials, and some employees make a business of suing their employers, knowing that they will settle instead of contesting the claim because it's far less expensive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We only had one such claim, for age discrimination. I forget how much we paid, but it was a lot for a company our size. And it came with a mutual NDA. It wasn't to keep the employee from talking, it was to keep the company silent, because &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; were the ones who were harmed. After the suit was over and settled, I realized then why none of his references were willing to talk about him. He was going through the Valley, to companies who were hungry for skilled programmers, and willing to take a chance, with or without references. No doubt we weren't the last company to pay him off and accept an NDA. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, even if there is no NDA, the laws in California and New York heavily favor the employee. So the company isn't likely to say much about a former employee it had differences with, because it could very easily turn into an expensive lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just want to say NDAs are not nearly as simple as candidate Elizabeth Warren made them sound in the debates. I know from experience and I am not a lawyer, she is, and I'm sure she knows all about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I know this because on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2008/11/05.html&quot;&gt;the day after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2008/11/04.html&quot;&gt;Election Day in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, I felt like I had been liberated from a life of racism. How did he get me to feel that way?</description>

			<description>I'm still hoping for help testing the new version of LO2. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/156&quot;&gt;list of things you should try&lt;/a&gt;. By testing, you're helping me think about bigger changes to the software in the future. If we don't test new versions, as a community, I can't take risks of breaking stuff. That's how it works.</description>

I'm soooo glad they can't tell when they've been snoozed. Oops I'm probably making all my friends think it's them. Trust me, it's not you. We're cool. Namaste.</description>
