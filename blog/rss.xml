			<description>I want a bank/brokerage website that has an easy UI. I don't care about commissions. My auto insurance company website is fast and easy. This builds trust, believe it or not. Nothing is worse than a bank that can't run a proper website. It's 2018, some bank should excel by now.</description>

			<description>What I hate most about Chrome's &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;NOT SECURE&lt;/font&gt; message is that this is all they could think of to say about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my wonderful blog&lt;/a&gt;. A blog that predates Google itself by four years. It's got humor and sadness, fun and tech tips. Yet all they can say is yuck we don't like this site. We welcomed Google. Even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/01/10.html#yupTheUsersCared&quot;&gt;loved&lt;/a&gt; them. And this is what's become of them. Heartless and soulless. Bullies. No love.</description>

			<description>There's a new brand of bike sharing in NYC now. Yesterday I saw two bright red bikes, shaped like a Lime bike or CitiBike, with a plastic basket up front. Didn't have time to read the logo/branding. Both in Manhattan. Andy DeSoto &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kadesoto/status/1033354917656911872&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; they're Jump bikes. And guess what, they say on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jumpbikes.com/cities/new-york-city/&quot;&gt;their site&lt;/a&gt; they're available now in NYC. (But only in Staten Island and Westchester.)</description>

			<description>I've been saying this for &lt;i&gt;decades.&lt;/i&gt; Every brand should have an iconic image that bloggers can crib. What that means is this -- a product shot on a white or transparent background. Large enough for large product shots, and for right margin images, we can make them smaller. I wanted to put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jumpbikes.com/&quot;&gt;Jump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jumpbikes&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; in the right margin, but when I do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;biw=1383&amp;bih=1186&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=4mSBW9uWH8mc_Qa7r4vYBw&amp;q=jump+bike+share+red&amp;oq=jump+bike+share+red&amp;gs_l=img.3...7026.8128.0.8463.6.6.0.0.0.0.151.585.3j3.6.0....0...1c.1.64.img..2.1.67...0i24k1.0.pDhlh-JQAjE&quot;&gt;image search&lt;/a&gt;, all I see are bikes being ridden or parked with lots of not-easily cropped backgrounds. No free advertising for Jump.</description>

			<description>I have a friend who's an accomplished computer scientist, really smart and creative in that area. Also a good teacher. But in politics he's a snotty bastard, he uses logic that could never work in debugging code. I wonder how such contradictions happen? Really puzzling.</description>

			<description>I like inclusive movements. I don’t care how you got to the party. Whether you took the subway, walked, came by spaceship or were driven by your chauffeur. What’s important is you’re here. That's also the philosophy of America, btw.</description>

			<title>Facebook is broken, part #3929</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I visit the site, I get the same top message. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I go to the popup menu to say &quot;Don't show me this again&quot; they start me down the abusive-user path. Why do I want to block this user. I don't. What did they do? Nothing, you fucked up FB. So I skip it, and every time I come here I see the same damn image, a movie about cilantro.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like cilantro, but it isn't the center of my existence. Facebook, we can move on from this. You have a bug. Give me a way to say stop showing me this message and the user is doing nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;By lacking a way to tell you this, you're compounding the insult of the bug. &lt;i&gt;Your&lt;/i&gt; bug. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Some people don't seem to mind if you know they're mean or corrupt. I've had this experience a few times. I guess they feel I can't do them any harm, so why not share their depravity? Funny thing is, eventually they all come to care that I knew. One of the mysteries of life. Our dear president appears to be one of those people, on a grand scale. And his chickens may be coming home to roost.</description>

			<description>A NYC story you won't read on the op-ed page of the NYT. I'm in the fucking bike line, a cab is waiting, adjacent to the lane, for I don't know what, and just as I approach he starts to move across the lane. I yell five times WATCH OUT and he stops, and as I pass, I make eye contact and yell FUCK YOU BIKE LANE. In Madison or Palo Alto you'd say Yo how you doing, but in NYC the salutation is FUCK YOU. Everyone understands this except people visiting from Madison or Palo Alto of course. It's why I like NY so much. Fuck you, let's dispense with the niceties. He was probably a Yankees fan anyway.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I was automatically upgraded to the new version of Gmail in the browser. The only new feature that I can see is that there's a really stupid animation that makes me wait for Gmail's UI to show up. Mail is a very integral part of my work flow. If anything they should make it load &lt;i&gt;faster. &lt;/i&gt;Making the load slower is imho inexplicable and indefensible. Another beautiful feature, where the star used to appear is now a trash icon. I just deleted a message I wanted to star. Oh that really makes sense. (Sarcasm.) Now an adventure to figure out where the fuck they put deleted messages so I can undelete it. It was important (which is why I was trying to star it).</description>

			<description>I think a lot of newbie software designers don't get that their users incorporate the quirks of their products at the base of the spine, i.e. beyond conscious thought. I think &quot;star this mofo&quot; and my spine tells my fingers to do it. My mind forgets the process. Breaking this connection immediately makes you think about things you normally do automatically. When I write my book there will be a whole chapter on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/01/04/burningBrainCells.html&quot;&gt;Burning Brain Cells&lt;/a&gt; which is what I call this phenomenon.</description>

			<description>The last couple of days I did a bunch of farting around with programmatic access to GitHub via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolNightly/blob/master/oldschoolnightly.js&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt;. I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/READMEx.md&quot;&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt; that said it was done with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/english/&quot;&gt;English editor&lt;/a&gt;, a project I vaguely remembered. I did a little digging and found the software and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/48&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I wrote documenting the work. The idea is to use GitHub as a blogging database. So what I did was get an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;Medium-Editor&lt;/a&gt; to edit stuff on GitHub. Couple that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/githubpub&quot;&gt;GitHubPub&lt;/a&gt; that maps subdomains on locations within GitHub repos, and you've got a nice dynamic blogging system with almost $0 hosting costs. Oh if only I had the time to chase down all these &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_Rabbit_Hole&quot;&gt;rabbit holes&lt;/a&gt;. 🐇</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolNightly/blob/master/oldschoolnightly.js&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that backs up a bunch of files from my blog onto a GitHub repository every night. So in case my servers ever go offline, there's another copy of the content, kept current automatically, on GitHub. It's good starter code for your own backup app. I rewrote it in the last couple of days to also back up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/misc/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/rss.xml&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/podcatch/subscriptions.opml&quot;&gt;files&lt;/a&gt; that were being copied by another process running in Frontier.</description>

They raise the right issues. Can't we do better than just throwing away archives, esp from a project that yielded such good results. I'm also not sure what Berkman meant about the blogs being antiquated. They seem to be saying people would be better off writing on Facebook or Twitter. Blogs have significant advantages over writing for social networks. There are tradeoffs. Perhaps the server software hasn't been updated. That could be a problem. We can help with the decisions Harvard is making. But there has to be communication first.</description>

			<description>On the Mac we had a phonebook size doc called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Macintosh&quot;&gt;Inside Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;. It was divided into toolkits, which were analogous to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages&quot;&gt;packages&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of each chapter was the theory, tightly written and edited. You might have to read a couple of times before grokking. Then all the calls you could make against the objects. As a result devs not only understood how to program the platform, but also understood the theory. I realize now that we are missing the equivalent doc for the web. Of course it wouldn't be printed. As a result you fumble around in the dark on a lot of stuff, not really understanding why things are the way they are, what the designers were thinking, and then years later it dawns on you. It's not too late imho to fill in this missing piece.</description>

			<description>Thinking about where I am in re a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/21.html#a144138&quot;&gt;Linux version&lt;/a&gt; of Frontier. I just realized that my collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;GitHub projects&lt;/a&gt; amount to the built-in verb set of Frontier. There are big missing pieces, and they aren't tied together in an object database, but the functionality is there. I am often reminded of this, when writing a utility script that would take minutes in Frontier, and I'm already on Day Two in JavaScript.  For example, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/master/daveutils.js&quot;&gt;JS code&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveutils&quot;&gt;daveutils&lt;/a&gt; package. I even use the same names as in Frontier, but without the Frontier syntax.</description>

			<description>We, who accuse the Repubs of cowardice, are just as scared as they are. Or we'd start striking, with picket lines. Shut the economy down until Trump leaves. It may ultimately come to that, but who knows, by then it might be too late. It's not too late now.</description>

Trolls die in darkness. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am fed up with supposed members of The Resistance who RT the troll. You are every bit as bad as Fox News. If people stopped RTing him now, he'd lose his power. You can help by shaming people who RT him, no matter what their stated intention. I'm going a step further and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1032293670161211393&quot;&gt;namechecking&lt;/a&gt; them as I unfollow.

			<description>I was talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Wes Felter&lt;/a&gt; last night about a project I want to do. I want to get Frontier running more or less as-is on Linux. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22wes+felter%22&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=twitter&quot;&gt;Wes&lt;/a&gt; was an early &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wes+felter&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;UserLander&lt;/a&gt;, he got us started with Frontier as an HTTP server. He understood the product at the time in ways I didn't. What came from that? &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;website framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software#Manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; and lots of other stuff. We talked about how to get the project done, and he suggested doing video demos of the things that make Frontier unique. It's a really good idea. And kind of daunting. I'm thinking about how to get started. I think the first step is to think of a project I can do in steps, that touches on most aspects of the environment. Maybe a web site for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22bull+mancuso%22&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Bull Mancuso&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://kim.smallpict.com/&quot;&gt;Kim Parker&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloatware.org/&quot;&gt;Bloatware&lt;/a&gt; (two not-so-famous fake people I use for demos and docs). It would be more interesting if it turned out to be something useful that made sense to deploy in Frontier. I wouldn't mind setting up a server on Amazon running Windows just to get the app up and running. And then getting that app running in Frontier on Linux would be the home run.</description>

			<description>On Sunday I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1031889058451128325&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that librarians should run the web. I got a fair amount of snarky pushback on this. I didn't mean that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; should run the web. I meant that the web should be run by people who are librarians. That the first questions they would ask would be questions librarians would ask. I've seen decisions made &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/10.html#a123459&quot;&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt; that took no account of the web as an archival medium. As a result, links to unknown amounts of the web broke that wouldn't have, if librarians ran the web. That's the thought behind that idea. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+librarian&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;librarians&lt;/a&gt; I've known have been considerate, even loving people. I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about that. Now I get that (of course) some are jerks. How could it be otherwise?

			<description>Brent Simmons has been working on a Frontier port, for the modern Mac OS. He's naming the project &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2018/08/20/rainier_diary_9_the_renaming&quot;&gt;Ranier&lt;/a&gt;. I like it, esp because the last three letters are ier, which says the foundation originated in Frontier, but it also frees up Brent to follow the product where it wants to go. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Journalism has lots of problems, but the really big one is that distribution is a mess. There needs to be an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union&quot;&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; of news. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro&quot;&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;. It's no longer an idea for the future, it's a model that should have been implemented long ago, and we should be growing based on it.</description>

			<title>It's time to rebel</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If the news wants to be effective it should spend some amount of time not just describing our quagmire, but having realistic discussions for what we can do to dig out of it. There's no discussion of this on MSNBC as far as I know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Jonathan Chait &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/08/media-trump-russia-collusion-benefit-of-the-doubt.html&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt; why news won't factor in the corruption of the Trump govt, I think it's because if they did, they'd have to start leading the rebellion, or at least looking for people to interview who are ready to lead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience&quot;&gt;Civil disobedience&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike&quot;&gt;general strike&lt;/a&gt;. Boycotts and picket lines. Those are proper citizen responses to treason on the part of the president. These ideas should be present in the press coverage. But if you put off accepting as fact the corruption of the government, you don't have to cross that bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If you really want to blow someone’s mind, next time you agree with someone, tell them. If you were going to qualify it, don’t. And if you think of a snappy rejoinder, chuckle to yourself and don’t pass it on.</description>

			<description>It would be great to have a daily website that summarizes what's on each of the MSNBC shows, so I don't have to watch them. Each segment on each show. Any new information or ideas makes it in. Omit recitals of previous optics. I don't care what pundits think. Same for each of the Sunday morning shows. I just don't have the patience. If I had to list something I learned from any stretch of MSNBC-watching, I might learn one thing every week and that's it. Most of the stuff they report as news is what has appeared in my RSS river during the day. Please go ahead and put ads on the site. Or ask for donations via Patreon. It's worth a few bucks a month, also because it will force MSNBC to change, to stop being so repetitive, and to start taking a look at news more broadly than just how the legal case against Trump is proceeding or not. There is other stuff going on, and there are other ideas that need exploring. They are deep in a pointless rut.</description>

			<description>They should give Krugman’s mike to someone else. Same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/opinion/the-slippery-slope-of-complicity.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; every time for the last N years.

			<description>I haven’t heard from anyone at Berkman re the early blogs we hosted there that they have taken offline. I’m assuming at this point that we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/15/141004.html&quot;&gt;all the info&lt;/a&gt; we’re going to get. Take-away: I hoped academia would be how we could ultimately make the web long-lived and future-safe. Now this seems like a foolish dream.</description>

			<description>When I rent a car, one of the first things I do is pair my iPhone with it, so I can play podcasts over the car’s sound system. But it may be sharing my contacts with the car. Does the rental company download those when I return the car?</description>

			<description>I finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth a rewatch, to see how a person with huge money and a toxic character can destroy a community. In the end it is anything but a comedy. The last couple of episodes, when they wrap everything up, are really low quality. You see this happen sometimes in a great series. Everything but the writing is still great. They make up for the lack of coherence with music, to try to make the stupid shit they're doing seem dramatic, which just makes me turn away. I remember being angry that they didn't do a fourth season when the show was running. I have no such feeling now. I think they could have ended it without the last couple of episodes. Even so, it's a story for our times, in tech and politics, now one very rich and toxic person can spoil a flawed but vibrant community. Some rich people got rich by stinking up the room so thoroughly that people of integrity say &lt;i&gt;Go ahead you can have it. &lt;/i&gt;That's their business model. Look at the top names in tech history. At least 1 in 4 are like that, in my experience. And there are a few second-tier characters like that as well.</description>
