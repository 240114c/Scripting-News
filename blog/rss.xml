			<title>XML-RPC site transformation</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've started to do the transformation of the XML-RPC site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Starting today, the main site is &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;. It documents all the new stuff, and will be developed and maintained, according to any interest by the community and/or myself.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/spec.md&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; has been ported to the new site. It is not a revision, none of the content has changed. It's just in a different format on a different site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The original site has been preserved at &lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;1998.xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was started in 1998 and the main work was done by 2001. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; redirects to &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;xmlrpc.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The site is backed up by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for issues and support, and to download the JavaScript implementation which I have been working on over the last year or so. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the big new stuff in this release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The reference implementation is in JavaScript now, not Frontier.  There's a client/server &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/xmlrpc.js&quot;&gt;package for Node&lt;/a&gt;, and a client implementation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/client/xmlrpc.js&quot;&gt;browser-based JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is an alternate &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/docs/xml-rpc-in-json.md&quot;&gt;JSON syntax&lt;/a&gt; for XML-RPC.  I wanted to see for myself how the protocol would look in JSON. It looks good, of course the payload isn't something we look at very often. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A new XML-RPC &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcdebugger/&quot;&gt;debugger&lt;/a&gt;, so you can test your implementation from a browser-based app. The debugger works with either XML or JSON syntax. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcbrowserclient/&quot;&gt;validator&lt;/a&gt; has been ported to the web also.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are broken links. Any links to pages on the old site that haven't been ported to the new site, and that's most of them, will be broken. They pages are still on the 1998 site, and I have the Manila source code for the pages. I will try to link to the original pages so they show up in searches at their new addresses. And time-willing, I will render the content in the new form so the links aren't broken at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I am one of the four original developers of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I welcome new implementations in languages and environments that didn't exist 20 years ago, and using new best practices. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Questions or comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/142&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>On this day we learned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/12/27/2122211/apple-news-no-longer-supports-rss&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; apparently stopped allowing users to add their own &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds to their News platform. I guess this is inline with the way they vet apps for iPhones. Can't let any random ideas get to iPhone users. Best to be safe. Perhaps to keep China happy? Not kidding. Tech companies ultimately have to yield to authoritarian countries, where they keep strict control on what the people can read. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50902496&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; can now disconnect their country's net off the world wide net. Losing a news platform like this is dangerous to freedom, pretty much everywhere. Best not to trust them with our flow of information, so use another news platform on their phones, and use other non-Apple podcatchers.</description>

See where we put the place to enter a new post? Right in the middle of the top page. The easiest place to get back to. See the menu at the top of the page. It's the same menu on &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; page. It gets you to the full functionality which included (in 2002) an RSS feed reader. How did we get there? Factoring. Over and over. Until it was logically organized for the person who we were designing it for. Full functionality doesn't have to be a maze for users, if you put the effort in.</description>

			<title>Flow in WordPress for writers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I write about what's missing in blogging software, as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/24.html#a153850&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, someone tells me about Gutenberg, and how that's the solution to the problem I've identified.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've never used Gutenberg, so I want to keep an open mind, even though I'm pretty sure that Gutenberg, even if it's great, is not the answer to the problem I keep seeing with WordPress, have been seeing since its inception. The problem is flow. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have an idea for a post. How many steps is it before I'm writing what I'm thinking. The more steps, and the less memorable they are, the more likely it is that I will either forget the idea before I start writing, or decide not to detour because it takes too much time to record it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OK, that's the preamble, now let me record the steps that I have to take to create a new post in WordPress. I disclaim I am far from an everyday WordPress user. But I have posted a lot of stuff to various WordPress blogs over the years. I am not a neophyte. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm at the main page of my website, called Unberkeley. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/myBlogsEditorialPage.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Show me where it says New Post. It isn't there, even though this is almost always the first thing a writer wants to do when they come here.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I clicked on WP Admin, which turns out to be the correct guess. I must've been here before? Or maybe I'm just lucky. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/wpadminpage.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. (BTW, imho this is not the WP-Admin page, even though that's what they call it. That would be a page for a system manager, not a writer. No writer is going to seem themselves as an admin, nor should they. This betrays a perspective, imho an incorrect one for most people who use the product.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On this page is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/quickDraftForm.png&quot;&gt;Quick Draft section&lt;/a&gt;. I will enter the text of my post there and give it a title as the form requests I do. I like how the Content area expands to the size of the text I entered. Much better than adding a vertical scroll bar. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/quickDraftWithText.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the Quick Draft area before I click on Save Draft. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now my post is in the Your Recent Drafts list. Clearly it has not been posted, nor is there any indication of how to post it. I'm guessing I should click on its title and see what I can do from there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now I'm at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/editPostPage1.png&quot;&gt;Edit Post page&lt;/a&gt;. Imho this page should be directly linked in big bold letters from the home page of the editorial control panel. This page should be the easiest page to get to. This page also has the Publish button which I will now press.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I expected it'd take me to the published page and it would have a big Edit This Page button on it in case I see anything that needs fixing. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/28/editPostPage.png&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; it takes me instead. But there is a Permalink on the page. I'm going to try clicking that. And sure enough now I am at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/test-post/&quot;&gt;published post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you accept the premise that publishing a post is the Hello World of blogging software, as I believe based on 25 years experience, there is a method to straigntening this out. You go through the list above and start eliminating steps, moving the New Post functionality closer and closer to the top and making it more obvious in every step. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, there is a very small Edit link on the published page, presumably I see it because I'm the author and am logged in. Clicking on it takes me to a page I've not seen before. A much nicer-looking post-editing page. I think this should be the home page of the editing function. But even this isn't Gutenberg apparently. There's a prompt at the bottom of the page asking me to try the new block editor to level up your layout. If this is the elusive Gutenberg, they might say so. If you're going to use that as its name publicly the software should use it too. And for crying out loud there is nothing for me to click to try the new block editor. I can get Info or learn more. I just want to try it. Help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I click on the Learn more link and twice it confirms that I am ready to try Blocks. I have to convert the post it warns. OK, since it's just a test post, what the heck. First I have to page through a listicle-like tutorial. And when I get there damn if it doesn't look just like it did before. I don't know why this is so momentous. I'm going to come back to this in my next visit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Flow is the writer's problem for blogging. I have been working on this since I started in 1994. I solved the problem for myself in 1997, and ever since I've been working on solving it for everyone else. Had WordPress designers simply &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2002/01/10/dtwsEditBoxScreen.gif&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; at Radio UserLand, shipped in 2002, and copied its menu structure, they would have a much better flowing blog platform and a reader interface as a central part of the product. But since then Facebook and Twitter have matched or bettered Radio in flow. There's a new benchmark. WordPress appears oblivious. So no I don't think Gutenberg, which is a new text editor for WordPress, is the answer. It is the answer to other problems, how to mix text and other elements in a blog post. Certainly a good thing to do. But WordPress imho remains the klunky monolith that it always has been. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, you can do even better than moving the New Post command to the top of a klunky interface. You can move all the setup stuff off to the side and give the user a Facebook-like interface for writing posts. You could even make Gutenberg the default editor. The text editor imho was never the issue with WordPress -- for writers. Writers can make-do with almost anything there. But the flow from idea to idea is what writers really need. For that you should probably start with an outliner, study it, learn from it and adapt it to public writing. That's where imho the real juice is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But a good short step would be to build a Facebook-like interface for WordPress, working with the same database, so both the current and the writer's view work on the same data. Writers are important and for writers flow is everything, how easily can I get your software out of my way and flow my ideas into the minds of the readers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>During the 2016 election I watched reruns of The West Wing and found it relaxing, to be able to visualize a government run in a human and intelligent way. Last night, looking for something to watch, I spotted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/the-newsroom&quot;&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and thought I would give it a try. Perfect choice. Another Sorkin show, a bit dated, in terms of tech very dated, but who cares. It's a bunch of actors, some good and famous reading Sorkin dialog about how news would work if it worked well. I've just watched the first three episodes, it's an incredible antidote to the way news is these days. Highly recommended, and as I step through it I expect to have more to say. BTW, it's available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/The-Newsroom-Season-1/dp/B00CW8DRU8&quot;&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.</description>

			<description>A bingeing update. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/20/211446.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; on Apple, but when I picked it up again, starting with episode 4, I couldn't stand it. It was like a bad soap opera. One word: Insipid. Too bad because the actors are great and they had lots of money to do it right. The story is childish and the dialog is embarrassing. Those are also some of my criticisms of The Newsroom (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/27.html#a135542&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;) but there is substance in that show and the writing is pure Sorkin, so it's funny to think the actors are just saying what Sorkin told them to say. Like Leo and Bartlet, Josh and CJ. Except not them, other people. And lots of lessons about journalism. For example &lt;a href=&quot;http://pressthink.org/2019/12/the-christmas-eve-confessions-of-chuck-todd/&quot;&gt;Chuck Todd&lt;/a&gt; is lying when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-disinformation-spreads-according-to-chuck-todd-interview-929912/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; he didn't get that the Repubs were always lying on his air. How do I know? Because the fourth episode of The Newsroom is all about Repubs openly lying. And that was a non-journalist writing, at least &lt;i&gt;nine years ago.&lt;/i&gt; If Sorkin could figure it out, so could Chuck Todd. He's playing us, badly and we'd be foolish to accept him at face value.</description>

Now they're delivering packages to the local post office. The packages are clearly addressed to my home, not to a post office. This is kind of okay at least they're indoors and the postmaster there is okay with it, but they are dropping the packages off on the front desk after the post office is closed. Leaving them in the open is like leaving your wallet on the counter in the post office. People are honest, but that's too much of a temptation imho. At some point someone is going to take the packages before I can get to the PO.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've told the UPS people in Kingston this is not acceptable but they say it's the driver's call.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a comparison, I had a package delivered by Fedex a few weeks ago, when the road to the house was fairly covered in snow, and they just drove the truck to the house and made the delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is actually what they're &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to do, in other words and it's not unreasonable. The road is not on a hill, it's flat, and easy to drive on. I understand if there's a foot of snow, but so far that has never been the issue with UPS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>XML-RPC site restoration</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;For the time-being I've set aside the project to try to rebuild the original 1998 XML-RPC site from xmlRpc.root. I'm taking an inventory of what we have and what we are missing first. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of the docs we have.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/bootstrappingTheTwoWayWeb.html&quot;&gt;Bootstrapping the Two-Way-Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/mailList.html&quot;&gt;Mail lists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/alidl.html&quot;&gt;RFC: A Little IDL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/davesSoapJournalPart1.html&quot;&gt;Dave's SOAP Journal, part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/bdgChangeNotes.html&quot;&gt;Change notes -- 3/29/01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/news.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/stateApril2001.html&quot;&gt;The State of XML-RPC, April 2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/rpcInteropTests.html&quot;&gt;workspace.userlandSamples.rpcInteropTests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/xmlRpcMan.html&quot;&gt;The XML-RPC Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/weblogsCom.html&quot;&gt;Weblogs.Com XML-RPC interface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/currentTime.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for Current Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/callForEndorsements.html&quot;&gt;Call for Endorsements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/howTheWebBugSimulatorWorks.html&quot;&gt;How the Web Bug Simulator works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/metaWeblogApi.html&quot;&gt;RFC: MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/rebuttalToRest.html&quot;&gt;Rebuttal to REST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/weblogsComForRss.html&quot;&gt;Weblogs.Com for RSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/metaWeblogNewMediaObject.html&quot;&gt;RFC: metaWeblog.newMediaObject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/roundingMetaweblogApi.html&quot;&gt;RFC: Rounding out the MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/subsHarmonizer.html&quot;&gt;In progress: Subscriptions harmonizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/mttf.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for MailToTheFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/aggregatorApi.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for the NewsRiver aggregator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the ones we don't have yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/faq.html&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/feedback.html&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/validatorDocs.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC validation suite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/validator1Docs.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC validation suite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/manilaRpc.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for Manila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/manilaRpcSpec.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface for Manila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap11.html&quot;&gt;A Busy Developer's Guide to SOAP 1.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/theXmlRpcMan.html&quot;&gt;The XML-RPC Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/manila.html&quot;&gt;manila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/googleXmlRpcGateway.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC Gateway for the Google API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/googleGateway.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC Gateway for the Google API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are other stories on the sites, but these are the ones that have paths defined for them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure what the next steps are going to be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/13.html#When:9:07:42PM&quot;&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html&quot;&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. I knew the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/15.html&quot;&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; because I went to college &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/16.html#When:1:20:10PM&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. I think there will be a lot of Katrinas, I don't think anyone who knows disagrees. The city was devastated. It might have been technically possible to do something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center&quot;&gt;Rockefeller Center&lt;/a&gt; Christmas tree, in New Orleans, in the aftermath of Katrina, but no one would waste the effort and it would seem &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/09.html#a205150&quot;&gt;tone deaf&lt;/a&gt; a term people like these days. We're on the cusp of that. It still seems normal now to burn carbon like that, but in not much more time, we'll wonder how we ever took pleasure in such extremely negative images of how we destroyed our way of life. Another example. I was living in NYC during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy&quot;&gt;Sandy&lt;/a&gt;. I was 30 blocks north of the blackout line, on the good side. I had electricity, but everything south of 23rd St was blacked out for weeks. After a while I ventured on foot into the blacked out area.

The Republicans have this angst filled â€œdebateâ€œ and in the end they do the evil thing. It's a trick. They find they can get credit for being open-minded and fair without actually having to be open-minded and fair.</description>

			<description>I'm continuing to struggle getting the old XML-RPC Manila site to open and render in today's OPML Editor. I really want to get that site fully restored before moving on. I posted a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=footer#!msg/frontier-user/m9wdhmLRii8/nwUU7JRCCwAJ&quot;&gt;on the Frontier-user list&lt;/a&gt; where in 2015 they were talking about this stuff but never got to the resolution. When this is done I want to have an app you can run that converts a Manila site to a folder of HTML files. So we never forget how to do this again. I feel the weight of all the good work we did, and how embarrassed I am that we tried so hard to preserve things, and so far have utterly failed, at least in this one important example.</description>

			<description>I'm reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F&quot;&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&lt;/a&gt; by Phillip K Dick. A small part of the story is the basis for the movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner&quot;&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/a&gt;. A bounty hunter and artificial humans. There's a test that determines if someone is human or android, based on the ability to empathize. Androids don't empathize, humans do. It occurs to me that the online world we have created limits ourselves to androidly behavior. Empathy is not very common.</description>

			<description>I ordered a CD-ROM drive from Amazon, and am now reading backups from UserLand from April 2000. Should be interesting. I'm thinking about uploading the full unmodified archives. It includes a snapshot of all the Manila weblogs, from editthispage.com and weblogs.com. Problem is there are passwords in the files, almost 20-year-old passwords, but you know how that goes. What do you all think?</description>

			<description>One candidate could change everything by raising money to do good things for Americans right now, not after they get elected. The idea that value was flowing to the people not the owners of the media companies would inspire voters. It would inspire me. This would be bigger imho than Sanders and Warren not taking corporate donations. I think we'd welcome big corporate donations, as long as the money was flowing in a good way.</description>

			<description>What I want most for Christmas is to do a final build of the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC site&lt;/a&gt; as a static Manila site, so the 1998 version that's about to be retired is safely preserved for the future. The problem is outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/141&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I could have answered the question myself, in 2002.

			<description>Speaking of which there should be a place I can download a final release of Frontier from 2004 or so, with Manila baked in, and its full web interface.

			<title>A chicken or an egg?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something cute I did a few days ago. I wondered, if Twitter could handle the full text of blog posts as I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/17/151033.html&quot;&gt;advocating&lt;/a&gt;, how could it work. I came up with an approach, and implemented my side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the source of a recent post here, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/24/164526.html&quot;&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; you're reading right now, you'll &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/theMeta.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; a &quot;twitter:body&quot; meta element in the header. Its content attribute is a base64-encoded markdown version of the post. There's a minimal amount of HTML in the post for basic features that markdown can't do. It's something Twitter could experiment with right now, if there's a developer there who thinks this is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Of course this data is there for any other curious developer who wants to play with the idea. That's kind of how RSS got bootstrapped between 1997 and 1999. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Wanting to want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid I had so many material desires, so many things that cost money that wouldâ€™ve given me pleasure. Mostly stereo and sports equipment. I didnâ€™t have any money. Now I could buy anything that I want. But thereâ€™s nothing money can buy that I want.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As has been pointed out elsewhere there are exceptions to this rule. I want a hot tub. For whatever reason I can't seem to get the things I need together to get it installed. When I get one, I will say publicly, probably on my blog and elsewhere, that I've wanted my own hot tub since I left Calif in 2003 and that it's insane that something so good for the human body is so hard to get access to outside the home. There are, in Calif, hot tub places in every town, like bowling alleys. In the east, they just don't have them. Someone should go into that business, I bet it would boom, and would help people in the east relax (not sure if that'd be a good thing or not).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the rule. When I shop on Amazon I can't find anything I want the way I wanted things when I was a kid looking through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.searsarchives.com/catalogs/history.htm&quot;&gt;Sears catalog&lt;/a&gt;. But there &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; things I wanted like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Sign-Fiber-Tipped-Black-S520/dp/B00006IFJL/ref=asc_df_B00006IFJL/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=167123392997&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13295402309173569244&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-138272589675&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Pentel Sign Pens&lt;/a&gt;, but as soon as they got them on Amazon I basically bought a lifetime supply and gifted them to a few of my friends. Of course now my once gorgeous handwriting has devolved into barely readable scratches. I almost never write by hand, maybe to address an envelope, or write a greeting card. So even Pentel Sign Pens don't bring me joy. BTW, if you've never gotten a Pentel Sign Pen they truly are wonderful. Even for adults, but as a kid, they were magnificent. I wonder if kids today have to write by hand? Hmmm. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, when I got all the boxes out of storage from Berkeley I got to go through my childhood a bit. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/gradeSchoolNotebookPage.png&quot;&gt;first page&lt;/a&gt; of a notebook, either first or second grade, probably second. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a process at work here that I'm just beginning to understand. When I was a kid, I had a small immediate family and a very large secondary family. My paternal grandfather had twelve siblings and most of them had relocated to NYC during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II&quot;&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt;. So my mother had a huge number of cousins, and some of them were close. A bunch of them lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5736302,-73.8634738,3a,75y,77.25h,88.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZ0iOyYfCNhPDuAIv25OiaA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Rockaway&lt;/a&gt; where my grandparents lived. But that was 50 years ago. They're all gone now, and the bonds didn't extend into the next generation. So I have a very tiny remnant of a family now. I seek friendships that can take their place, but truth is they can't. I'd pay a lot if I could buy another weekend with the relatives who are gone, even the ones who drove me crazy, but alas that is not for sale anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Though I didn't realize it as I was writing this piece, it's one of the big threads of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/23.html#a120326&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A bunch of them lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5736302,-73.8634738,3a,75y,77.25h,88.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZ0iOyYfCNhPDuAIv25OiaA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Rockaway&lt;/a&gt; where my grandparents lived. But that was 50 years ago. They're all gone now, and the bonds didn't extend into the next generation. So I have a very tiny remnant of a family now. I seek friendships that can take their place, but truth is they can't. I'd pay a lot if I could buy another weekend with the relatives who are gone, even the ones who drove me crazy, but alas that is not for sale anywhere." created="Tue, 24 Dec 2019 15:27:41 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/24/151136.html#a152741"/>

			<description>Last night was the final episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. One word review -- masterful. Lots to think about. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/mr-robot-series-finale-recap-season-4-episode-12-and-13.html&quot;&gt;Vulture synopsis&lt;/a&gt; is great, obviously it's entirely spoilers, as is this post. The big question of this episode and the entire series it turns out is &lt;i&gt;Who Is The Real Elliot?&lt;/i&gt; For that I got the same answer Time had for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)&quot;&gt;POTY in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. We're all Elliot, having constructed more agreeable versions of ourselves to share with the world, hiding who we are many levels deep, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. It's recursive, Mr Robot says. You wake from one dream to find yourself in another and another. I imagine many people will dislike the end, the same way they didn't like the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the story is real, some of it matters, but in the end not much actually changed. Mr Robot asks us to look at ourselves and our families and friends, and how much of it is what we wish it were, vs how much is as it actually is. There isn't anything unique in this story, it's really the story of our lives, waking up from the dream we concocted to get through childhood. Endings to stories are hard, the art is in where they leave you and how much they change you, and the ending of Mr Robot scores high on all counts.</description>

			<description>How to make corned beef hash. It's incredibly simple. Boil some potatoes the night before. Drain the water, add a bit of vinegar, let sit, covered, overnight. In the morning, chop some corned beef, fry it alone (without potatoes). When nice and brown, put the beef on a plate, leaving the pan greased with fat from the beef. Chop an onion, fry it, then add some chopped potatoes. Then mix the two and fry together. You can add garlic if you like. Mix it up, then remove the hash and fry a couple of eggs in the same pan and serve them on top of the mound of CBH. There's really nothing to it but boiling and frying, but it's really tasty.</description>

			<title>Working with Manila</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the XML-RPC site work, I want to statically rebuild the site from the Frontier object database containing all the content as a Manila site. I have copies of manila.root and xmlRpc.root. I have gotten it to build a static site that appears ready to be built by the Frontier website framework. Now if I can only remember how to build one of those.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;at the docs&lt;/a&gt;, and for the life of me I can't find a simple explanation of how to actually build a site, which is odd because that's what the docs purport to be about. Back then we didn't do a Hello World for this problem, that helps to put the stuff you need to know first up front. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/menus/web.html&quot;&gt;Web menu&lt;/a&gt; is tantalizing but it doesn't appear to have a command that builds a whole site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>An odd thought. The Republicans are trying to eliminate rule of law. At the same time they're rushing to appoint judges. If they're successful, judges are just people, their opinions don't matter. Why do they care so much about judges then. Also, suppose the Supreme Court says his tax returns must be released. What does he do?</description>

			<description>The thing in tech that sucks the most. A product everyone uses won't add a feature that would open it up to new ideas by independent devs. So you have to reimplement the whole thing, and convert their user base, to try out a new idea. Which means the new idea never gets tried out. First experience was MS-DOS and its lack of a clipboard in 1985. The OS had to be scrapped, effectively, because it never adapted to the more-than-one-app-at-a-time model, even though developers were achieving great success with that model.</description>

			<description>I tried watching Sunday morning TV news, in a time when there's lots happening, lots of pieces in motion, and even though the stakes are high, it's really interesting in the way the NBA playoffs can be interesting. In the last week, we finished the first round, and now there are new matchups, and public opinion matters in a whole new way. And guess what, on CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC -- they keep saying the same tired and wrong things they were saying last week and the week before. It's just a horse race to them. Nothing matters but the election in November 2020.</description>

It certainly isn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=dead&quot;&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; Mr McKinley says it is. But I do appreciate the sentiment. He's right that people are crazy when they miss Google Reader, it's like missing the pet fox your friend let sleep in your hen house. Google was very bad news for RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I started thinking of other things Google Reader is like.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An oil spill by Exxon in virgin Alaskan wilderness. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A nuclear meltdown in the city you live in a suburb of.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A neighbor who runs a crack factory down the block from an elementary school.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I may add items to the list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's fun to hate Google Reader, but it's over my friend, and we are free to do whatever we like. Enjoy the holidays knowing that Google Reader is dead, RSS is fine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's that time of year</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to, every year, name a Blogger of the Year. I wanted to keep the idea alive, that amateur writing has a place on the web. The last couple of years my focus has been elsewhere, even though in 2017, I took a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;fresh approach&lt;/a&gt; to my own blog, with imho excellent results. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a choice for this year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have a favorite blogger, perhaps a blog that goes with a favorite podcast, please add a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1208429729113612288&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's to another great year in 2020, and remember it's even worse than it appears. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was driving around this afternoon, and there were school buses everywhere. Why are the school buses out on a weekend I wondered. Drove past the school, huge numbers of buses and cars and people. Then it hit me. It's Friday! Oy.</description>

			<description>My priorities for the next government include. 1. Incorporate the Voting Rights Act into the Consitution, including references to specific former-slave states that need to be monitored in perpetuity, it never expires. They've proven that no amount of time is enough, as soon as the Court declared the VRA unnecessary, they reverted to their pre-VRA approach. 2. Prohibit gerrymandering in the Constitution. 3. Prohibit corporate contributions to campaigns and make PACs illegal. Individual citizens can contribute, with limits. Get big money out of our elections. Our elections have to mean something.</description>

			<description>We didn't finish &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era&quot;&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt; after the Civil War. I think that's the bug that needs to be fixed. Maybe we need to add a dozen more free states, so we can fix the Senate and Electoral College so long-dead slave owners don't run the country. It's really ridiculous. It's kind of loopy that the first impeachment, of Andrew Johnson, was because he undid Reconstruction, allowing the former slave-owning states to bring back &quot;slavery lite&quot; -- aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws&quot;&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
