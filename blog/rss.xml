			<description>Pretty much everything in the news that draws attention away from the danger of the virus is imho off-topic, maybe even unethical. Your readers are in danger. Many don't know it. Find ways to make them understand.</description>

			<description>An observation about servers on Node.js. Node is optimized for servers that handle millions of requests an hour -- to run services like Google and Facebook. Billions of users. But Node is most often used by services with far fewer users. Tradeoffs are everything in software. There should be popular server software, based on JavaScript, that creates more reliable, debuggable, easier to write servers, for the loads most people really have.</description>

			<description>Cuomo is going to make mistakes. At least he's managing the state's response to the virus. Other states can't say they have a governor doing that. And the country doesn't have a president. Also, be careful what you call a mistake with the benefit of hindsight.</description>

			<title>Examples of #savemylife journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spoke for an hour yesterday with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nakedjen.com/&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; in Salt Lake City. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic there is very different from how it is where I live. Even though I moved to the country, I still live very much in the influence of NYC, which has suffered greatly. Massachusetts is less than an hour away by car, has been hit hard too. But in the mountain west, where Jen lives, a Republican territory, they &lt;i&gt;aren't&lt;/i&gt; hunkered down like we are. Jen and her family of course are. They're smart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My conclusion has been this: we're going to have to hit the wall a couple more times before everyone understands how frightfully scary and unknown this virus is. It would help if the US government were leading, but that wouldn't be enough. People who were terrified by 9/11 certainly have the capacity to understand the danger of the virus, they just haven't seen it yet. They will, I'm sure of it, because there's no other way out of the conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think everyone should read three bits of writing before they risk their lives or those of others before trying to resume their former lives. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/opinion/coronavirus-young-people.html&quot;&gt;Mara Gay's first person account&lt;/a&gt; of getting and &quot;surviving&quot; the virus in the NYT. She's young, fit, got the disease in mid-April, and it's destroyed her health. That's not too strong a word based on her account. People may not know this isn't binary, you don't just live or die. Some people survive and have lingering incapacity. How long does it last? &lt;i&gt;No one knows. &lt;/i&gt;We are exploring uncharted territory in the US because other countries halted the pandemic before they got to the stage we're at. I hope she fully recovers. I'm worried that she won't. She tells a powerful story. Uses her position on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/opinion/editorialboard.html&quot;&gt;Editorial Board&lt;/a&gt; of the Times in a noble way, in a blogger's way, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of bloggers, you should also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zeldman.com/2020/05/16/its-a-good-day/&quot;&gt;Zeldman's account&lt;/a&gt; of getting Covid-19 in mid-February and still is incapacitated. His daughter has it too. He's going through the same thing, though he's considerably older than Gay. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A random thought. We're hearing about younger people, some very young, who are having horrific experiences. Why aren't we hearing these stories from older people? Possibly the older people don't survive to become incapacitated. Maybe Covid-19 is long-term a young person's disease after all. Remember it isn't binary. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more must-read piece -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/amid-the-coronavirus-crisis-a-regimen-for-reentry&quot;&gt;Atul Gawande's checklist&lt;/a&gt; of how medical personnel in Boston are avoiding getting the infection. It's not any one thing, they do it by carefully incorporating the techniques the CDC recommended before they were silenced by the US government, the ones followed by the winners, South Korea, Taiwan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/02/145311.html?title=coronavirusInVietnam&quot;&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, China. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All three pieces fall strongly into the category of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt; journalism. Rather than inciting fear, Gawande shows us how to calmly and systematically increase our odds of not getting the disease. If I could make reading these pieces a requirement to continue reading my blog, I would. I want the smartest readers. Being smart is an investment, you learn what others are learning and think and do what you have to to protect yourself and others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Stay safe and wash your hands! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/17/cuomoPodcastImage.png&quot;&gt;new graphic&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo Briefing Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I thought about putting some text on it, but decided a simple color picture of the governor was sufficient. If people want to give it a try, send me your version. I'm totally open to improvements. BTW &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/04/cuomoBriefing.png&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the original version.</description>

Instead of writing the first draft of history, tell me how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Bike ride notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Huge number of sirens near my house in the country earlier this afternoon. Really frightening and weird. Later on my daily ride, I figured out what it was. There were signs on the road about a birthday celebration. Obviously all the emergency vehicles were wishing the person a happy birthday. It was a huge demonstration. I speak from having lived in midtown Manhattan, how surprising to hear something so loud, like that in the country. When I was trying to figure out what it was earlier the only thing I could think of was that there had been a terrorist attack, a very large one. But here? In the middle of nowhere? It's not a good thing to disturb the peace like that, especially in such a peaceful place.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4ev-H_XBQQ&quot;&gt;ride&lt;/a&gt; today I came across a lot of walkers and riders, I was the &lt;i&gt;only one&lt;/i&gt; wearing a mask. That's not a good feeling, gotta say -- I did my part to protect them, but they didn't reciprocate. Not one person wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In news everything is a race between two political parties. The reds and the blues. There are other perspectives, for example I have the perspective of a citizen: voter, taxpayer, juror, soldier (according to the president), and now -- possibly infected, transmitting, part of a death toll. Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/politics/coronavirus-whistleblower-testimony/index.html&quot;&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bright&quot;&gt;Rick Bright&lt;/a&gt; wasn't just a scandal, as much of journalism characterized it, it was also a clear statement that the US government isn't doing anything to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Trump's promise about the vaccine recalls promises about his tax returns. The end of the year is also after the election. At that point, either way, he'll have no need to follow-through on this, as with the tax returns. He'll say he never thought there was going to be a vaccine.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/contagion&quot;&gt;Contagion&lt;/a&gt; is on HBO. The first half is a pretty good dramatization of Covid, then it goes off the rails.

			<title>Unmasked on the Rail Trail</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went for a ride yesterday along the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ashokanrailtrail.com/&quot;&gt;Ashokan Rail Trail&lt;/a&gt;, a very nice bike and walking trail, alongside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashokan_Reservoir&quot;&gt;Ashokan Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, which, believe it or not, is part of NYC. 1/6 of the water for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_water_supply_system&quot;&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; comes from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/101552.html&quot;&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; of water. Pretty sure the rail trail is also NYC property.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people were not wearing masks and of those that were, many had them around their neck. I was wearing a mask, I actually like the warmth and moisture. I also like the civics of it. But it pisses me off when people don't reciprocate. It means their viruses are spewing all over everyone else, including me, and possibly into my body, and might possibly cause me to get sick or worse.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;s&gt;asshole&lt;/s&gt; cyclist passed me on his bike on the way back, no mask, and he slowed down in front of me, so I was getting all of his virus in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake&quot;&gt;wake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/05/masks-covid-19-infections-would-plummet-new-study-says&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that if everyone in America wore a mask it would stop the virus cold. Who needs a vaccine. We just need people to stop being such intellectual dorks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you are not wearing a mask when you go out, you can get off my porch right now!   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/12/08/what-its-like-to-walk-the-new-ashokan-rail-trail/&quot;&gt;ART&lt;/a&gt; is the kind of amenity you'd expect in Boulder not the Catskills. Let the record show that as our civilization crumbled we were just beginning to do nice things for ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This trail is just 15 minutes from where I live. I have a nice bike rack on my car, so it's easy for me to get there. That said, I think the riding where I live is better. I live in paradise even compared to another nearby paradise. And most of the people around here wear masks and they keep them on their faces!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sign on the Ashokan Rail Trail.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdEHzFiKrSw&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ashokan+Reservoir/@41.9664626,-74.3219922,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89dd024fe33ca6dd:0x8b66e1238c3c2a81!8m2!3d41.9784966!4d-74.1650991&quot;&gt;reservoir&lt;/a&gt; taken from the rail trail yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Back in February, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/17/150159.html?title=whatIsScroll&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.com/&quot;&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. I have more to say about it, quite a bit, but here's the top-level -- why don't the publications sign up already? There are quite a few that I am interested in, but don't want a relationship with. If I want to watch a movie or TV show I don't have to give my credit card info to each studio, I wait until the program shows up on Netflix. I buy lots of stuff on Amazon, but they don't actually manufacture anything. That's what Scroll would like to be -- a distributor for news. It makes a lot of sense. We're always hearing tales of woe, how are the pubs going to make money, how they need money from the tech companies and governments. How about getting money from readers? If they listened to the readers they would tell them what I'm saying. Make it easier for me to pay you. Scroll has stepped up, why not just say yes. If the situation really is so dire, maybe it's the answer?</description>

			<description>From time to time people ask how I do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email distribution&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News. I looked at the various services that do this, but they all had lock-in in the center of their business model. I already have a way to write my blog. So that meant that they had to publish from my site's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, and none of them do that. Since I'm a developer, I wrote my own mail-sending software. I have made bits of the software open source, but it's not something that an end-user could use. I can't productize everything I write, and typically when I do, very few people use it, so I just made it for myself, and at least I know the user is happy, and will give me good feedback and bug reports. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Maybe it's because I'm a former entrepreneur that I see &lt;i&gt;tons&lt;/i&gt; of ways to do this.   Biden, for example, could give Fauci a pulpit. I've tried this idea out of people inside the Democratic Party, they say this just isn't done. And that's a reason not to do something? Bill Gates could do it. He's entrepreneurial. It doesn't have to be Fauci himself, any affable avuncular scientist who tells the truth. As Trump fades into oblivion we should fill the airwaves with facts.

			<title>&lt;i&gt;ALEXA!&lt;/i&gt;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I use my kitchen Alexa only to listen to WNYC. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Usually I say &lt;i&gt;Alexa WNYC&lt;/i&gt; and it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I have to say it slowly and loudly, being sure there’s no other sound. It takes 3 or more tries.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But when I say &lt;i&gt;Alexa stop&lt;/i&gt; it works every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another idea: A special deal for bloggers. People can read the stories if they come from my blog. The NYT used to do this. I felt like we had risen above crass commercialism, and were focused on informing people. Here come the lectures on how I don't understand news!</description>

			<description>How about a twist on that. Any paying user gets to forward stories from the site a certain number of times? Not sure about that. It's always so irritating when a friend RTs a story from the WSJ. It just doesn't make sense for me to subscribe. I did at one time, so I know what they do. I just am not that active in business these days. But sometimes they get a great story. Maybe what we need are peering arrangements of some kind. You get 50 free articles from the WSJ with a NYT subscription, and vice versa. Maybe those two pubs don't do it. But maybe say Mother Jones and National Review. Kind of like William F. Buckley &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2016/10/3/13081784/best-of-enemies-gore-vidal-william-buckley-pbs&quot;&gt;debating&lt;/a&gt; Gore Vidal?</description>

			<title>The NYT (still) needs fresh air</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/28.html#a215257&quot;&gt;high hopes&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt;, former editor-in-chief of Buzzfeed News, was hired as the NYT's media columnist. I first became familiar with his work when Buzzfeed got a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier&quot;&gt;Steele dossier&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; it with the public, causing an uproar in the press that it had not been vetted and should not have been published. I listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/pages/12818.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with him and New Yorker editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Remnick&quot;&gt;David Remnick&lt;/a&gt;, and cheered in a post &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/28/errOnTheSideOfDisclosure.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His position: The readers are smart. If we tell them it hasn't been vetted, they will add the same grain of salt a good reporter will. The contents of the dossier concerns them, they have every right to see it, since it was influencing politics and journalism. Outrageously, the press and Washington insiders had copies of the dossier for a long time, and had not released it. Meanwhile dumps of Clinton's emails were appearing, unvetted, almost daily. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/28/errOnTheSideOfDisclosure.html&quot;&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt; Smith and Buzzfeed for siding with the people. I have found this trust of readers to be very rare in journalism. Most journalists hold readers in great contempt if they think of us at all. Smith's philosophy was in sync with the blogger's view. And I was glad to see it in a respected mainstream publication -- Buzzfeed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when Smith went to the Times, I looked forward to finally having some pushback on their editorial page, which never allows dissent from the orthodoxy of the most prestigious of news orgs. &lt;i&gt;We Know Best&lt;/i&gt; could be their motto. &lt;i&gt;We'll Tell You What To Think, &lt;/i&gt;might be the tagline. This has gotten us into huge trouble over the years, for example with the buildup to the Iraq War, where they carried Bush Administration lies, unopposed, never retracted or apologized-for. Then in the 2016 election the fabricated story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; was born in the pages of the NYT, constantly repeated and amplified. You could legitimately blame the horrors of the Trump Admninistration, which are still reaching new heights, on the Times. Again, no mea culpa, and more importantly, no pushback from the op-ed pages. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another subject where piety has had no dissent on the editorial page is the idea that the tech industry stole their business and therefore owes them money. This is often repeated, never rebutted and is completely corrupt. As Bob Bierman said so well in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobbierman/status/1259809847698227201&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; this morning, in rebuttal to Smith's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/200510/p72#a200510p72&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/business/media/big-tech-has-crushed-the-news-business-thats-about-to-change.html&quot;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Respectfully, nothing was stopping a newspaper from starting a simple classifieds site, a micro-blogging site or a community where people could talk to each other.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That is such a key point. I've been banging this drum since the inception of the web. Compete! Open the pages of your news product to the people. I called this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;Sources Go Direct&lt;/a&gt;. I had a specific proposal for the Times in 2002, let the contributors be vetted by NYT reporters. Put their blogs on a separate domain with a big disclaimer. But when sources post there, you have quotes for future NYT articles. And stars will rise, and more important, your inbred ideas will be challenged under your masthead, something the Times needs, and more important, something the world needs. Had the Times done this there might not have been a Facebook, or they might not have played such an important role in the distribution of news.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Times has become too powerful and too unopposed. And now they want to cement this victory by drawing money from the tech companies, or to be paid money from taxes. The answer has to be no. First try to compete, and then try again and again until you get it right. Tech still doesn't do news well. There's a new world still to be explored, try to create a great news product out of the net, jump in and stop pretending news works as it did before it went electronic. And get some fresh blood on the op-ed pages. Let's get some real criticism of the Times there, at least. We don't need royalty in the White House and we certainly don't need it in journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
