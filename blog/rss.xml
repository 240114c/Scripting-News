			<description>I foresee a day when we'll have writing collectives on the web. Small groups of people striving for excellence in thought and expression, as a collection. I already know two people I'd like to write with.</description>

			<description>When the Democrats debate tonight, I hope they remember there are people listening. Try to make us see how things would be different and better if you were president. I really don't care if you can show one of your rivals to be wrong.</description>

			<title>Navigating the archive</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A reader asks how to find posts from previous months. I explained.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've used a lot of different content management systems over the years, so the archives work differently. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example, this is the archive page for September of 2018.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/&quot;&gt;http://scripting.com/2018/09/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Some are in this form, for example July 2012.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2012/07.html&quot;&gt;http://scripting.com/2012/07.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For most months it's one or the other.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I figured out why the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/12/122844.html&quot;&gt;Breaking Bad movie&lt;/a&gt; is so unsatisfying. I watched it, I liked it, but it didn't get me excited and interested like the series did. I decided to re-watch the last season to see what the difference was. There are many great things about the show. The use of music, the weird camera shots that are integrated with the plot. It's artistically ecelectic in so many ways. But it's also &lt;i&gt;slow. &lt;/i&gt;Things develop very very slowly. But there's no space in a 2-hour single-episode show to develop the puzzling intrigue of the series. No time to spread out, relax, take your time, go slow. So not much happens, and then it's over. It's not really Breaking Bad, it's a 2-hour movie with the characters of Breaking Bad. That was the same problem with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood:_The_Movie&quot;&gt;Deadwood movie&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing that could work is another 10-episode season, played out over 10 weeks.</description>

			<description>And Succession. It had one of the all-time great season finales last night. No spoilers here, except to point to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9E1eBLqWc&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that HBO produced that summarizes the deliciousness of the end, do not watch it if you haven't seen the whole season. It really would spoil it.</description>

			<title>Customized searching</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been emailing with my old friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/IntroducingDaveCarlick.html&quot;&gt;Dave Carlick&lt;/a&gt; about customized searching. I've also been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/09/143957.html&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about it here. I'm not sure I've made my point, but now I have an excellent example that might shed some light. Dave, take note.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I just searched Google for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot; old+school&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It came back with pointers to a 2003 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_(film)&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;. A Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/OldSchoolMovie/&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old-school&quot;&gt;dictionary&lt;/a&gt; definition. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=old%20school&quot;&gt;urban dictionary&lt;/a&gt; version. And on and on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But I have a product named &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;. I've written about it on my blog a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+&quot; old+school&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;bunch&lt;/a&gt; of times. If Google knew I was the author of this blog, it would also know that when I search for Old School, I want to see my product first, because in all likelihood that's what I'm looking for. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what I mean about associating the searcher with the searcher's blog. Think of it as SEO for a person. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's another one. I just searched for Dave Carlick. Google asks if I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/14/didIMeanCarlock.png&quot;&gt;meant&lt;/a&gt; Dave Carlock. That's crazy. I've been friends with Dave Carlick for 30-plus years. If it read my blog it would know that. It's so wrong. In fact, if I type Carlock it should know I meant Carlick. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Google is so crazy that when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Dave+Carlick+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=Dave+Carlick+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l2.1191j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;restict the search&lt;/a&gt; to my site, it still asks if I meant Carlock, even though there are references to Carlick &lt;i&gt;on the site I'm searching&lt;/i&gt; going back to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/IntroducingDaveCarlick.html&quot;&gt;1990s&lt;/a&gt;. And the only refs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTwZ7Hn9FWhmqTjXuOfyD9HmpV29Q:1571062782317&amp;q=Dave+Carlock+site:scripting.com&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif6Lz4-JvlAhXlmeAKHQcNByEQBQguKAA&amp;biw=1390&amp;bih=1182&quot;&gt;Carlock&lt;/a&gt; are this post.

			<title>Stories on GitHub</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I tried out an idea. It's a little Node app that runs on the same server as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; that builds this blog. Every minute it looks at today's posts, for those that have titles (like the post your'e reading now), it checks if it changed, and if so it renders it as Markdown and uploads it to GitHub in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/stories/&quot;&gt;calendar-based structure&lt;/a&gt;, along-side all the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;parts&lt;/a&gt; of the blog I maintain automatically on GitHub.  I like using GitHub this way, I have a feeling it'd make a good shared object database.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been hand-generating links to the GitHub version to get you all thinking about this idea, like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;As an experiment this story is archived &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/stories/2019/10/14/a130849.md&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did this based on an assumption that I would be able to figure out a way to make it possible for any of my posts to become a sub-project on GitHub. I'm not saying any of them &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; become projects, only now it would be possible. I thought this might work well with the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email distribution system&lt;/a&gt; which has stimulated so much discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how this is going to work, or if it will work, I'm just trying an idea out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Pro tip for podcasters. In your RSS feed, each &amp;lt;item&gt; should set the &amp;lt;link&gt; element to point at the landing page for the episode. Otherwise the only way to share your podcast is with a link to the MP3 which isn't good for you or them. You can see dozens of these items in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/podc/&quot;&gt;podc&lt;/a&gt; account on Twitter.</description>

			<description>A lot of other people, including Republicans, have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/warrens-same-sex-marriage-quip-captures-what-some-find-exciting--and-others-distressing--about-her/2019/10/11/f3e15a14-ec34-11e9-85c0-85a098e47b37_story.html?fbclid=IwAR0XG4_2Vt6Oi6JRsYbLTTwo2dQAy2HgtaGu_UN4UYzo4h-VbbJ7qfAxYmk&quot;&gt;picked up&lt;/a&gt; on Elizabeth Warren's unfortunate &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/12.html#a125744&quot;&gt;putdown&lt;/a&gt; of people who think that marriage is between one woman and one man. We have to have a serious talk about this, because it reveals a side of Warren that is divisive and unacceptable. I'm sick of electing presidents who divide us into evil and not-evil. It's &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; sickness of our country. Honestly I don't care about marriage, anyone's marriage. I think marriage is an awful institution. It wrecked the family I grew up in. So no one has the high ground here as far as I'm concerned. And while I think Warren is the best candidate we have now, I think she needs to do some soul searching on this. If she is elected, it would be tragic if she does the same kind of BS that the Republicans do, and tries to make some Americans outcasts. After all, the question she was asked was about other people's &lt;i&gt;beliefs, &lt;/i&gt;not their actions. And as president, her job would be to safeguard their rights, along with those of people she agrees with. As faculty at Harvard Law School I would think she would be steeped in that understanding, that it would run in her blood. The Constitution isn't just for people we agree with.</description>

			<title>Politics has a long way to go</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I put the name of a company in a tweet with a problem with their product, in 2019 there's a pretty good chance a support rep will respond and try to help. The quality of the help varies, but they do try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But in all the years I've been blogging, or tweeting, or whatever, the only response I've gotten from a political campaign was to add me to their donor list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened with Obama, Hillary Clinton.  It was really humiliating because in both cases, I passionately wanted them to win, but not just the way Obama did, rather in a way that would lead to effective permanent organization of the electorate using networks. Every emailed request for money reminded me of what they thought of me. Give us money. Give us money. And give us money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So far Warren has just ignored what I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Elizabeth+Warren%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, even though imho it's been good advice. I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/13.html#a135827&quot;&gt;today's piece&lt;/a&gt;, especially, is make-or-break for her campaign. To be doing so well up to this point and have the problem show up this early, is scary. I'm not sure that even if she wins, it'll be any better than Trump. That's how serious it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Politics is like public radio. They say they're doing it for the people but in the end what they want is donations. At some point we'll have a campaign that embraces the people, and learns how to use networks to organize us. But it hasn't happened yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As an experiment this story is archived &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/stories/2019/10/13/a150753.md&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's Trump v the Constitution</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;News reports everything as Democrats vs Republicans. This makes me angry, because some things, like the president ignoring the Constitution, are not partisan issues. Yes, the Democrats are on the right side of this one, but so are honorable Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I used to call for tech boot camps for reporters, to help them get the basic facts right, and avoiding But Her Emails type tragedies. It seems they need legal boot camps too, so they can understand (and report) better on how our constitutional government works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As an experiment this story is archived &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/stories/2019/10/13/a134309.md&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Running Unix apps in background</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;For an application I'm developing I need to run it in the background, yet easily stop and relaunch it. So this is what I do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At the command line type &lt;i&gt;nohup node app.js &amp;&lt;/i&gt; and press Return. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can see the output of the app by pressing Ctl-C then &lt;i&gt;tail -f nohup.out&lt;/i&gt;. It creates this file in the directory the app was run from.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To kill the node process and any other node processes it might have launched, enter &lt;i&gt;killall -i node&lt;/i&gt;. The -i flag means that it will confirm before killing each process.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I put these notes in my blog so I can find them again, easily, and don't have to figure it out ever time. Also so people who know more than I do about this topic can tell me better ways to do this. :orange:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As an experiment, I'm mirroring this post over &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/stories/2019/10/12/a140257.md&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>El Camino was unnecessary</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Of course I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie&quot;&gt;El Camino&lt;/a&gt;, the new Breaking Bad movie on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81078819&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn't really a movie or an episode of Breaking Bad. It was more like a few scenes from a Breaking Bad episode with brief appearances by many of the characters from the series, looking much older than they did at the end of the last episode (which aired six years ago).   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a lot like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/deadwood-the-movie&quot;&gt;Deadwood movie&lt;/a&gt;, a series that was cut short and should have been allowed to finish. The real &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota#19th_century&quot;&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of Deadwood had a climax that was never part of the TV series. The movie was basically plotless, it was a series of cameos by the stars of the original series, the actors looking much older, in some cases not recognizable, saying a few things, not to be seen again. For a show that had such gravitas, was so daring and unprecedented, it was a kind of humiliation. Yet it got good reviews. I don't understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert -- yes there are spoilers below. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nothing much happens in El Camino. As we know from the end of the series, the protagonist, Jesse Pinkman, survives and escapes. He hooks up with his old friends, remembers some scenes from the past, has to solve a problem, kills a few people and rides off into the sunset. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay it was fun to watch, but I hoped for much more. If you loved Breaking Bad as I did, you should watch it. But all this show does, imho, is set the stage for yet another pointless encore. There's a lot to be said for an edgy show like Breaking Bad leaving you at the edge without telling you what happens next.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Amazon Fire Cube :-1:</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/08.html#a135920&quot;&gt;excited&lt;/a&gt; to get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KGVB6D6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Fire Cube&lt;/a&gt;, but after a short installation and exploration, I realized it was nowhere near as good as it has to be to earn a place in my living room. I'm going to return it and instead buy a current Apple TV. I'll report on that later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Re the Cube, it has to compete with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+roku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; user interface that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;baked into&lt;/a&gt; my TCL screen. It clearly has this ambition, when it sets itself up, it remarkably figures out how to turn on and off the TV and my Onkyo receiver. I think this is a combination of better standards and testing. Impressive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But when their desktop appears, it's a confusing mess, and in every way assumes what you want is Amazon Prime Video, even though it has Netflix and other apps. They clearly are biased. Understandable, but not functional. I come to them from a world where they don't control me, so it's a turnoff. I'm just as likely to watch something on HBO Go or Netflix as on Prime. Their desktop should be more agnostic. It's okay to put your app first in the list, but really that's as far as it should go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if the Spectrum app for Fire worked better than the Roku one, but I couldn't figure out through their app store interface how to search for an app by name. That's ridiculous. They understand the importance of search in other places, but not here? I couldn't figure out which class of app a cable provider would fall under. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I tried the Alexa functionality. It's weird that it must have talked to the other two Alexas in my house to figure out how to connect over my wifi. I never had to enter a password. This spooked me. This Alexa works differently and it's hard of hearing! I couldn't figure out how to get it to stop without unplugging it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they must have special problems with an environment where other speakers are present, but they weren't making any sound when I was trying to communicate with it. And the Alexa in the kitchen sometimes heard and responded to my queries, so it's pretty clear that having two Alexas in adjacent rooms isn't going to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I then went back to Roku's desktop and breathed a sigh of relief, and decided the Fire Cube sucks. I don't want it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It clearly has this ambition, when it sets itself up, it remarkably figures out how to turn on and off the TV and my Onkyo receiver. I think this is a combination of better standards and testing.

				<source:outline text="But when their desktop appears, it's a confusing mess, and in every way assumes what you want is Amazon Prime Video, even though it has Netflix and other apps. They clearly are biased. Understandable, but not functional. I come to them from a world where they don't control me, so it's a turnoff. I'm just as likely to watch something on HBO Go or Netflix as on Prime. Their desktop should be more agnostic. It's okay to put your app first in the list, but really that's as far as it should go." created="Fri, 11 Oct 2019 14:13:56 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/10/11/141248.html#a141356"/>

			<title>Blogs are little things</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had a long-term problem with comments on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. If I have open comments then I have to moderate them. It helps to have clearly published &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which I do, that eliminates most of the emotional reactions, but some still get through, and people can hold grudges for a long time. I don't like editing other people. I already do more of this kind of work than I want to. My goal is to get rid of all of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I first started out I had a pretty optimal system. The posts went out via email to small groups of subscribers. You could respond, and I would see your response and so would the others in your group. Sometimes interesting discussions would take place. For some reason very little flaming. I lurked. When someone wrote a piece I thought should get on the record, I'd forward it to an email address that was monitored by a script I wrote, which would then add it to the current &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/mail/default.html&quot;&gt;mail page&lt;/a&gt;. It wouldn't publish until I had a chance to hand-edit the text. It was work, and I remember not liking it, but there were some real classics among the mail page posts, so I did the work, for a couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could re-implement the Mail Pages, but it's not something I want to do, and it would be harder today, given the way email worked then and now. It's gotten more complex. I also had a scriptable email app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(email_client)&quot;&gt;Eurdora&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to write the whole thing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; which was really good at driving scriptable Mac apps. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so now here we are in 2019, and I have an excellent use-case. I wrote a short &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/08.html#a140651&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Medicare, asking for input, and have gotten back some wonderful responses. One in particular was beautifully written, long, detailed and obviously based on a lot of experience. As I read such an email I ache a little. &quot;This should be on the web,&quot; I think to myself. Finally when I get to the end I respond with praise, and a request that they post it to their blog. I put it that way because 1. maybe they have a blog or 2. maybe this will get them to start one. But the most likely response is a story about how they have a blog, but haven't posted to it in a long time and they feel guilty, so presumably they don't want to go there for some reason? I don't really get it, because I know what a blog is, behind the scenes. It isn't a place. It's just a few files on a server, very small files, and a few database entries perhaps. The reason companies like Automattic and Google host blogs for free is that's how much it costs to host one a blog. It really is of no consequence.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You imagine that your blog is lonely and angry that you're not visiting, but that's  purely a figment of your imagination. The blog doesn't exist in any &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=corporeal&quot;&gt;corporeal&lt;/a&gt; sense. It has no thoughts or feelings. I doesn't give a shit if you live or die, because it doesn't have an ego, it doesn't care about &lt;i&gt;anything. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of creating a blog as you would think of writing on a page in a notepad. Or scribbling on the back of an envelope and handing it to someone. It takes two minutes at most to create a blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/create-blog/&quot;&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. And from then on, you have a &quot;place&quot; to post emails you that are post-worthy (I will tell you if they are). Then you can send me a link and I can put it on my linkblog page, and send it to my Twitter followers, and people who read me on RSS, and in the nightly email. It might be more flow than you'd get from posting it on Medium, for example. And if I asked you to post it, that's almost a guarantee that I will circulate the link.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have created lots of one-off blogs and I'd do it again in a heartbeat, esp if it meant we could make the world a better place, or at least more informed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Should we think of Twitter as part of the open web for the purpose of linking? I ask because I found that something I pointed to, and embedded in my blog, that I felt was historic, was on an account that Twitter suspended. The tweet was no longer available. I understand why Twitter needs to suspend accounts, but do they have to get rid of all the previous posts? Does Twitter care about the web? Do they want to be part of it?</description>

			<description>I had to do a lot of driving today and listened to two Daily podcasts back to back, which should be listened to together, imho. The first was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/podcasts/the-daily/impeachment-inquiry-democrats-republicans-kavanaugh.html&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of the Republican strategist who managed the Kavanaugh confirmation and who is now leading the impeachment defense for Repubs. It was infuriating, esp the way the Times reported it. In the second podcast they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/podcasts/the-daily/house-democrats-elissa-slotkin.html&quot;&gt;followed&lt;/a&gt; one of the pivotal Democratic reps, from Michigan, as she met with constituents at two town halls. The hot topic was impeachment. What was so fascinating is that you can hear, quite clearly, the result of the propoganda from the subject of the first podcast that is &lt;s&gt;informing&lt;/s&gt; enraging the anti-impeachment voters. The rep was admirable, made me proud to be an American, a contrast to the first, who made me feel there's no hope for our country.</description>

			<description>When the Repubs say that impeachment is just a way to undo the 2016 election, they overlook the 2018 election, which was most definitely an attempt, by the voters, to undo the mistake of 2016. The only reason the House can contemplate impeaching Trump is that there is a Democratic majority. That happened in 2018.</description>

			<description>I just re-read George Orwell's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm&quot;&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/a&gt;. I had read it when I was in grade school. It's worth reading again in the age of Trump, because he's using the propoganda techniques of Animal Farm.</description>

			<description>If you love &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+sucession&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; and are all caught up, I highly recommend going back and watching season 1 again. So much of what happens and what's said went over my head the first time. And there are forward references you couldn't have caught the first time through. Watch it with captioning on, that helps too.  Also it's a comedy with the skeleton of a tragedy. I found myself laughing out loud at times as if it were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qvXvDfGnh8&quot;&gt;Monty Python&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜†&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Rambling about search</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if anyone has Wikipedia as their default search page. It just occurred to me, with Google searches getting more cluttered with garbage all the time, if Wikipedia might not be a better choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Brooklyn+Nets&quot;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; for Brooklyn Nets, and here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;. Which gets you a better set of links to topics related to the team? I guess the problem is there are no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Brooklyn+Nets&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNSE5Kh8llhcwE0qiVXY-kOCFflhgA:1570632411345&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiur83XtY_lAhUFmeAKHQe_CtEQ_AUIEigB&amp;biw=1491&amp;bih=1044&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Brooklyn+Nets&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNSvPhpiJUug7r-OEOCG7s8v5pJzsw:1570632442181&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPu6fmtY_lAhXNVt8KHQpyDXIQ_AUIDSgE&amp;biw=1491&amp;bih=1044&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Brooklyn+Nets&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNQaQdHDQ3rbD6fMW6sKZug8sLNgnQ:1570632455181&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO6cDstY_lAhUonuAKHdc5DiwQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1491&amp;bih=1044&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; options on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I probably should just start using &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Brooklyn+Nets&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;. It's very similar to Google, but not as insane, and they claim to not share your search habits with any other companies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You know what would really get me to switch? Customization. If I could tell it where my blog is, so it will default to showing me what I had written about a topic at the top of the search, or offer a tab that allowed me to quickly review my own writing. I could see that changing the nature of everything I do on the web, it would also be an incentive to people to leave the silos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd also like a pref that lets me ask it to always show me the Wikipedia page first. Other people might prefer a Twitter account first, or news about the topic. Google makes all these choices for you. But I'm a sentient user, I was using computers for decades before Google even existed. I know how to program, and yet, I can't use that skill on the most extensive information source ever produced by humans -- the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I ordered a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KGVB6D6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Amazon Fire Cube&lt;/a&gt;. I have a relatively old Apple TV, and was looking to upgrade because of a problem I'm having with the Roku version of the Spectrum app. I'm 99% sure the problem is with Spectrum, whose support people point the finger at Roku, which I think is BS. I considered buying a new Apple TV, but I've been using Alexa more and  more, and I find I miss it on my TV-watching system in the living room. This tells you something about how Amazon is moving to dominate TV. People think Trump is the new boss, but I'm pretty sure it's Bezos. Imagine if they bought Roku, which is the OS of my TCL television. Imagine if the OS goes down another level and takes Spectrum out of the software-development business (and I assume Verizon et al) which would be a blessing. They really don't do this very well. The wild card, the one company that could redefine news is Twitter, as I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder if anyone in the future-of-news world has comments?</description>

			<description>A long &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21178885#21179244&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Hacker News about yesterday's anniversary. One commenter said &quot;I feel bad for Dave. He was so early to the table on so many occasions yet he was left behind and never really made it big monetarily. He is the definition of missing the boat.&quot; I replied &quot;Please don't feel bad. I was never trying to make a lot of money from the web. I had lots of opportunities to sell out. I did that once, in the 80s, and that has funded my creative work ever since. Money isn't that useful, I learned, pretty early-on. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about that recently.&quot; I'd add that I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; disappointed that when the VCs started RSS companies and then podcast companies, they did it with other people, with imho predictably bad results. That was disappointing, but what the hell, no one made any money from those things, and I get to enjoy the podcasts and feeds as much as anyone. And for that I'm grateful. I also wish people like Zuckerberg cared more about the ecosystem, but he and I look at the world differently.</description>

			<description>I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, which I'm sure if you read this blog, you now know and wish I'd stop mentioning. Heh. One more time. I was 39 years old then, an age that to me now seems impossibly young, but to me at the time, felt really &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; old. I'm 25 years older now, 64, and in the US a lot of shit happens at 65, most important to me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Medicare&amp;t=hz&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently at that point, the cost of my health insurance will go down dramatically, and the coverage will go up dramatically. Not that I feel I'm wanting any medical care now that I can't get, and I can certainly afford the payments. Anyway this an awkard moment because I have no idea what the fuck Medicare actually is. I go to the websites and they tell me how much I have to learn, but they don't teach it. I am highly motivated to learn, but I'd love to have a user interface that was like GEICO's website for buying auto insurance, or the Digital Ocean page for sizing your applet. I'd like to just check off some boxes, and see the numbers change. If I want to spend $500 per month I could have this coverage, or that, or something else. It seems enough people go through this that it's worth a little investment?</description>
