			<description>&lt;s&gt;What I want most -- a list of people who were at BloggerCon I. I'm always surprised by people who were there that I have no recollection of. For me it was a whirlwind, huge fun of course, but few distinct memories.&lt;/s&gt;</description>

			<description>Terry Heaton sent a note yesterday reminding me that the original BloggerCon was held in October 2003, in other words, exactly 15 years ago this month. We missed the actual days, which I can infer from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/10.html&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; was October &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/04.html&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/05.html&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately the first archive.org &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040818060437/http://www.bloggercon.org:80/&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of the BloggerCon home page was in 2004, when were getting ready for BloggerCon III at Stanford. I'm going to keep looking on my servers and backups for data about the first BloggerCon. I'm going to archive that as I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.userland.com/&quot;&gt;archiving&lt;/a&gt; the old userland.com websites last month.</description>

			<description>I switched away from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2018/10/17/knicks-put-on-a-show-and-open-season-with-hawks-destruction/&quot;&gt;Knicks&lt;/a&gt; season opener to watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/25011260/fan-interferes-attempt-boston-red-sox-mookie-betts-catch-ball&quot;&gt;ALCS playoffs&lt;/a&gt; for a few minutes. When I came back the Knicks had set a record for the most points in a 2nd quarter by any Knicks team. Yes the Hawks suck. But still.. Could this Knicks team be a winner? Failing that could they at least be fun? It's been so long, 2012 to be specific, since the Knicks were fun to be a fan of. Meanwhile over in Houston, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texas-sports-nation/rockets/article/3-pointers-Takeaways-from-the-Rockets-loss-to-13316609.php&quot;&gt;Rockets&lt;/a&gt; have the Curse of Carmelo. I feel sorry for the old man. I really do. He was the heart of the Knicks for so long. Hate to see him become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_(sports)&quot;&gt;journeyman&lt;/a&gt;, the way he made &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/12/19/whatIfTheKnicksHadKeptJeremyLin.html&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt; leave home. I guess &lt;i&gt;what goes around comes around&lt;/i&gt; applies. Funny coincidence, Lin, who now comes off the bench for the Hawks, played in last night's game at the Garden. He was a bit rusty at first, but the old magic is still there, you can see it.</description>

			<title>Louis CK and the Daily</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The question of what to do with Louis CK was featured &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/podcasts/the-daily/louis-ck-comedy-cellar-metoo.html?action=click&amp;module=audio-series-bar&amp;region=header&amp;pgtype=Article&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; on the Daily podcast. It's a good thing to talk about, and it should be looked at from all sides, esp ones that haven't been challenged yet. It's especially important to challenge people who say LCK should never work again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They mention the example of Mel Gibson's anti-semitism. I was a fan, but I couldn't understand how Hollywood could ever let him work again after what he did. So I've had the same &quot;nuke him&quot; impulse around another issue. Mel Gibson is making movies. I don't think people are more or less expressive of their anti-semitism because he is. I've gotten over it, I won't go to see his movies. I still object to him as a celebrity, I can never think of him without thinking how he feels about Jews. I don't want to laugh at his jokes. But that's me. He gets to exist, and practice his art. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Noam Dworman, the owner of the Comedy Cellar club in NY made the only important point in all of this. He doesn't object to other owners refusing to let LCK perform on their stages, as long as no one tries to force him to ban him as well. I'm pretty sure this is one of those moral questions that doesn't actually have an answer. Maybe all artists that are great must also be flawed human beings. Maybe the reason why Louis CK is so good is that he is so bad? Maybe he can keep it under control as long as exposure is the penalty although in his case I could see where he might like being exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't have the answer, but on the other hand I don't think anyone else does either. I think that's what the owner of the club was trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But we know they’re actors, and the actors are actual people, pretending to be machines that look human. It creates an interesting conflict that they explore from every angle.</description>

			<title>Humans aren't really toxic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been wanting to discuss the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=toxic+masculinity&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;male toxicity&lt;/a&gt;. What does it mean? And why only male toxicity? Why aren't women given the same awful label? I likened it to the use of the word &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt; to apply to things that were never alive. Seems like a misuse of the term, an impossibility. I saw one person &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rickhood/status/1052521774653558784&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina was a toxic male, without explaining how or why or what it means. We're just supposed to know? I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052524370302779392&quot;&gt;don't&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I engaged on Twitter with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foosel&quot;&gt;Gina Häußge&lt;/a&gt; who used the term in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/foosel/status/1052477246634696705&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about a series of lovely old LEGO ads, one which &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/17/legoad.png&quot;&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; a girl and her LEGO creation. As a tech creative person myself, I am so proud of that little girl for following her path to geekosity. The smile on her face tells the story. Whatever this is, it's mine. That's the geek ethos imho. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think we should stop applying a word like toxic to people. It's not far from calling people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maryanngeorgantopoulos/trump-immigrants-vermin-infest&quot;&gt;vermin&lt;/a&gt;. It's dehumanizing. A prerequisite for violence. Find another way to say what you're trying to say or refine it so it's closer to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I don't think there's any way to measure the quantity of abuse one gender does to the other. It's all a soup -- we create each other. I inherited toxicity from both of my parents, and they from theirs, male and female, all the way back. We create each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We may not achieve some ideal we have for each other. A lot of our grievances come from that. I watch people online who are so good at finding fault in others, but never see the obvious opportunities &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; have to solve the problems themselves. If you regret other people aren't working together, the best approach is to start working with other people yourself. Take the advice you so want to give to others to your own heart, and then act on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This isn't new wisdom. Humans spend their whole lives figuring this out. It's why functional families are so nurturing, if we could only find one! Accept what we have and do your part to make the present and future better. That's about as good as it gets imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I saw one person &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rickhood/status/1052521774653558784&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina was a toxic male, without explaining how or why or what it means. We're just supposed to know?

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052224515932073990&quot;&gt;weird idea&lt;/a&gt; I proposed to one of my favorite political analysts. Why can't journalism raise issues? They don't have to let politicians drive this. Don't the voters have issues that need airing? What about the people who wrote the Constitution who expected Congress to act as a check on the Executive branch? Why do we have to sit on the sidelines and accept the crap they hand us. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052317163778990081&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; is doing it. Jeez. You'd think they wrote off the intellect and seriousness of the electorate. Time to change the way we do things. Journalism could be where the change starts. Of course they would have to listen, for a new idea to penetrate. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Goes back to when I lived in the middle of the golf course at the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sharon+Park+Dr,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.4248451,-122.2205468,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa4e515ff326d:0xc832d9097802f942!8m2!3d37.4244532!4d-122.2083052&quot;&gt;Sharon Park Drive&lt;/a&gt; in Menlo Park. Don did the INIT for &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/TNM_Userland_IAC_Toolkit_for_programmers_1991_20170830_0072/page/n0&quot;&gt;UserLand IAC Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=UserLand+IAC+Toolkit&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;was&lt;/a&gt; the precursor for the Apple Event Manager and ultimately XML-RPC and SOAP. Don is thinking about blogs these days, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/donpark/status/1051533792324636673&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; something &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/donpark/status/1051544612911738880&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday about blogrolls. He says wtf happened. There is no good discovery mechanism for blogs. I agree. Don had some immediate ideas, so I offered to start a thread on it, so maybe we could come up with some experiments we could do to see if maybe we couldn't bootstrap something now. That's what the previous post, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/15.html#a141922&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt; is about.</description>

			<title>Another tweet that's a blog post</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/13/tweetAsBlogPost.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1051109183389601792&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Here's the text, so search engines can find it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I used to speak freely on my blog in the early days, that was the thrill of it, and I still do speak more freely there, but it feels like very few people read what I write there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But I'm scared to speak freely here (on Twitter). Not because of bots-as-trolls, rather not wanting to be attacked by &quot;the left.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I find this interesting, because I vote totally lefty these days. I give to Democratic candidates. I promote them to the best of my ability.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But even so, my ideas would evoke a mob reaction from my allies. They have in the past,. It's a big punishment for speaking your mind. So I hold back.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We've invented something that looks like speech, but it's more of a way for mobs to organize. And the term mob, which I hate that the Repubs are using, so effectively, actually is the right word.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if there isn't some way to get through to our allies witout evoking their rage, that sometimes, maybe all the time, the rage works against our cause. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It would be better to hear what people think, rather than shouting them down and intimidating them into silence. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remember even if you can't hear them, they can still vote. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Our big sin, which we will keep paying for, is that we fought two wars without a draft and while lowering taxes not raising them. War must cause pain at home. One way or another you eventually have to feel it.</description>

			<description>If you asked my father what Dave's favorite music is, he would have told you what his favorite music is, and (importantly) he'd think he's answering the question. If you ask someone why Dave works so hard, he'll tell you what he aspires to. He might say Dave does it to get rich. That wouldn't tell you anything about Dave, but it likely tells you something about him. This is important to understanding disputes, and is why listening is so important. For example, the US thought North Vietnam was fighting because they were part of a global communist alliance to defeat the west. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory&quot;&gt;Domino Theory&lt;/a&gt;. Because we were at war against that. The Vietnamese were actually fighting a war of independence, and were puzzled why the US, a former colony that fought for its independence, was fighting them. Moral of the story: Unless you ask, you probably don't know why someone is doing what they do.</description>

			<title>Conferences and unconferences</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't like conferences that are all about the speakers, esp if I don't know who they are. When you put people on stage speaking, they have had so much time to prepare, they have slides for everything they thought of while they were preparing, and sometimes that was months. So it takes forever for them to get to the point. Or they don't do much prep, and they just play back the pitch they made to VCs or play the deck they used on their press tour.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or they're blowhard CEOs, so full of themselves they hardly know anyone else is there. I once heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison&quot;&gt;Larry Ellison&lt;/a&gt; speak at a tech industry conference where he thought he was talking to an Oracle User Group! At least we got to hear what he says to them (it was mostly press, financial types and his competitors). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across a different format in the 00s that we called an &lt;i&gt;unconference,&lt;/i&gt; a name that has since been usurped by a different format. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;our format&lt;/a&gt;, it's a discussion group with a leader at the front who interviews the room. It has to be someone who knows who's there, and has an idea for a story, and has a hardass attitude about people droning, repeating, and self-serving. With someone who knows what they're doing, it's something to behold. Everyone is on their toes, involved. And you can be called on, so you can't afford to lose track of what's going on in the room. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find professors and reporters make good moderators. The more opinionated they are the better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/newsgeist?lang=en&quot;&gt;Newsgeist&lt;/a&gt; conference I went to a couple of years ago actually carries on that tradition, in some of the sessions. I wonder why? Maybe it's because &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; is involved, and he was a big fan of the format back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What made me think of this is I've been getting email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://poptech.org/&quot;&gt;Poptech&lt;/a&gt;, a conference in Maine in early November. It's totally about the speakers. Kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences&quot;&gt;TED&lt;/a&gt;ish (though it's not a copy, it's a contemorary). I didn't know any of the speakers. I'm pretty sure I don't know any of the attendees. Why spend $2000 for that? Not that I didn't consider it, I did. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The political extremes get all the press, but most Americans are ready to compromise. Weary of the never-ending conflict.

			<description>Any time someone is inviting me to be enraged online, I'm suspicious that I'm being manipulated. My standard practice is to unfollow the person who sent them to me. They may mean well, but they're being used. I don't need your rage, I have plenty of my own. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Interesting Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1049960588896595973&quot;&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; with Davis Shaver re what's going on in the WordPress community. I don't have time to write about it now, but it sounds like what I experienced in the Frontier community leading up to my leaving in 2002. I will say this, that you can't forget that it's software you'd developing, and not the community. That's where the focus has to be. Otherwise you explode. No one person can be the focal point of a development community, and if it's a blogging community it's 100000 times worse! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>There’s this great line at the end of an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order&quot;&gt;Law &amp; Order&lt;/a&gt;. Jack McCoy says the person who was convicted got a tough sentence. The DA, an old man, says when he gets out he’ll be 35. “I’d take it,” he said.

			<description>I found a perfect use-case for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp&quot;&gt;CSS variables&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; hard-codes the size of &amp;lt;h4&gt; elements at 17.5 pixels. In the editor I'm developing, the default size is 18px. I find it's the most readable size for editing. Anyway, when you put a small head in the text using &amp;lt;h4&gt; the text is actually &lt;i&gt;smaller&lt;/i&gt; than the surrounding text. Not good. Enter CSS variables. Declare --normal-font-size as 18px, override Bootstrap's idea of the size of &amp;lt;h4&gt;, and use the same variable in defining the size of all the other text. That way the relationship is clear in the code, and if we ever want to change the size of normal text, it's easy to do. This is progress. Code just got more maintainable. 👍</description>

There are 34 total candidates. The normal 33 plus the special election for Al Franken's seat in Minnesota.  So if you wanted to give $25 to each, it would cost $850.</description>

			<title>Being picky is for losers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I find people who are willing to trade off moral superiority against losing the election, still, given all that's happening, the most depressing thing about American politics. No one cares about your &quot;point&quot; -- we're trying to get back on course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thinking of an analogy. Suppose you're taking a car trip and your navigator decides to take you over a bridge that's washed out because it's shorter than the detour that isn't washed out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to give up one thing to get the thing you really need.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Manchin voted for Kavanaugh. His opponent will for sure vote with McConnell on everything. Manchin would not have been the deciding vote if it came down to that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a real joy in giving up on perfection. Now you can get something done.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>#metoo as a political issue</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A longtime friend was taken down by #metoo. Lost everything. The screed against him, posted on Medium, when edited down to real, not imagined, accusations was that when he was drunk he felt the breasts of a woman who was also drunk, in public, at a party at a tech conference.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He admitted it, and apologized, even though because he is an alchoholic, he had no memory of it. I thought the accusation should have been made without a lot of the imagined offenses, very clearly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't one of the famous targets of #metoo, he was just quietly deleted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No, I don't think it was fair, but that isn't the point of my story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted a note of love and support for my friend on Facebook, and almost immediately the threats of accusations against me came both publicly and privately. Nothing that amounted to anything, but it made it clear I'd better shut up, or else I'll be joining my friend in oblivion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was terribly sick in 2002, he was one of three friends who stood by me. He came to visit regularly while I was recuperating. He always listens when I have something to say. He's a good friend. He also can be a total jerk. I've seen that too. He got drunk on a lot of bullshit, not just alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since then the #metoo parade has passed him by. I'm sure very few people remember what happened to him. But he can't get back on his feet. He's in AA now. He's become a house husband, taking care of the kids while his wife works. I'm sure some people take pleasure in this, feel it's only fair that a man's life be destroyed this way, because so much terrible stuff has happened to women.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally I get to the point of the story..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you're right, in some moral way, maybe men do deserve this. But while my friend's life has been destroyed, he can still vote. His friends can vote. I won't vote Republican because of this, but I would like the Democrats to start worrying about this too, not seeing it as so one-sided, that all women are right and fair, always, and would never accuse a man of doing something he didn't actually do. Or wouldn't embellish it to make it more dramatic. Or use an accusation to get even for some other perceived offense. Or maybe for no reason at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Women are people, as humanly flawed as men. Give them a way to hurt other people, and they will use it. The idea that a woman would never make an accusation unless they knew it was true is incorrect. So we need to do better than simply &quot;believe the woman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, there was abuse in my family when I was growing up. So I know how it ruins lives. I've written about it on my blog. There's a lot more I could write if I had the courage to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Because there is unfairness in the #metoo movement, because it silences a legitimate point of view, it gives the Republicans something to campaign on that resonates. We have a problem. Much more than Kavanaugh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="A longtime friend was taken down by #metoo. Lost everything. The screed against him, posted on Medium, when edited down to real, not imagined, accusations was that when he was drunk he felt the breasts of a woman who was also drunk, in public, at a party at a tech conference." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:02:32 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150232"/>
				<source:outline text="He admitted it, and apologized, even though because he is an alchoholic, he had no memory of it. I thought the accusation should have been made without a lot of the imagined offenses, very clearly." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:03:17 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150317"/>
				<source:outline text="He wasn't one of the famous targets of #metoo, he was just quietly deleted." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 17:41:25 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a174125"/>
				<source:outline text="No, I don't think it was fair, but that isn't the point of my story." permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="I posted a note of love and support for my friend on Facebook, and almost immediately the threats of accusations against me came both publicly and privately. Nothing that amounted to anything, but it made it clear I'd better shut up, or else I'll be joining my friend in oblivion." permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="When I was terribly sick in 2002, he was one of three friends who stood by me. He came to visit regularly while I was recuperating. He always listens when I have something to say. He's a good friend. He also can be a total jerk. I've seen that too. He got drunk on a lot of bullshit, not just alcohol." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:04:35 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150435"/>
				<source:outline text="Since then the #metoo parade has passed him by. I'm sure very few people remember what happened to him. But he can't get back on his feet. He's in AA now. He's become a house husband, taking care of the kids while his wife works. I'm sure some people take pleasure in this, feel it's only fair that a man's life be destroyed this way, because so much terrible stuff has happened to women." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:04:50 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150450"/>

				<source:outline text="Maybe you're right, in some moral way, maybe men do deserve this. But while my friend's life has been destroyed, he can still vote. His friends can vote. I won't vote Republican because of this, but I would like the Democrats to start worrying about this too, not seeing it as so one-sided, that all women are right and fair, always, and would never accuse a man of doing something he didn't actually do. Or wouldn't embellish it to make it more dramatic. Or use an accusation to get even for some other perceived offense. Or maybe for no reason at all." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:05:12 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150512"/>
				<source:outline text="Women are people, as humanly flawed as men. Give them a way to hurt other people, and they will use it. The idea that a woman would never make an accusation unless they knew it was true is incorrect. So we need to do better than simply &quot;believe the woman.&quot;" created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:06:22 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150622"/>
				<source:outline text="BTW, there was abuse in my family when I was growing up. So I know how it ruins lives. I've written about it on my blog. There's a lot more I could write if I had the courage to do so." created="Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:07:13 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/08/150222.html#a150713"/>
