			<description>Here's a new version of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc#readme&quot;&gt;XML-RPC for JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc#readme&quot;&gt;client and server&lt;/a&gt; for Node, and a client for the browser. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/xmlrpcdebugger/&quot;&gt;debugger&lt;/a&gt; you can enter a call in, see what goes over the wire and what comes back. If you're using XML-RPC in JavaScript, please consider using this package and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/9&quot;&gt;give feedback&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a current implementation for any environment, please post a note here. In my next pass I plan to make the &lt;a href=&quot;http://reboot.xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;rebooting page&lt;/a&gt; into the home page for the XML-RPC &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I just got a question from a user about how to get the OPML source text from an outline you're editing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. Two steps. 1. In the File menu, choose &lt;i&gt;View OPML.&lt;/i&gt; 2. In your browser's File menu, choose &lt;i&gt;Save Page As.&lt;/i&gt; That's it. You now have a local copy of the file.</description>

			<description>This week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/podcasts/1619-black-american-music-appropriation.html&quot;&gt;1619 podcast&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic. It's the story of American music. I laughed and cried, and get goosebumps thinking how great America is, thanks to slaves and ex-slaves and children of slaves.</description>

			<description>We were able to boot up podcasting from Harvard with $0 in funding. That's something we can replicate. So ask the Media Lab if their goal is to create new media, or spend lots of money. Because they are mutually exclusive things imho. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I once went to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brockman_(literary_agent)&quot;&gt;Brockman&lt;/a&gt; dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;http://henryshunan.com/&quot;&gt;Henry's Hunan&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. It was loud and people moved around between tables. Henry's is not a snazzy joint, which made this event fairly un-Brockman. John Markoff and John Perry Barlow were there, with about 30 others. I hung out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Parker&quot;&gt;Sean Parker&lt;/a&gt;, the future president of Facebook, who had just finished with Napster. I was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/12/17/whatIfTheRiaaHadEmbracedNapster.html&quot;&gt;big fan&lt;/a&gt; of Napster, thought the music industry should have kept it running forever, if they had, they'd own Spotify, basically. Napster proved there was huge potential in networking music. It was inevitable, always, that music would go the way it has.</description>

			<description>Like everyone else, it seems, I am now obsessing over the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/succession/season-2&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;. It's my new family, and it's of course so much like my real family. I haven't watched Sunday's episode yet. After that I think I'm going to watch the Netflix series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80178151&quot;&gt;The Spy&lt;/a&gt;, though I'm not sure I'm ready to accept Sacha Baron Cohen as a serious actor.</description>

			<description>Google is being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/190909/p19#a190909p19&quot;&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/09/texas-attorney-general-leads-google-antitrust-probe.html&quot;&gt;antitrust&lt;/a&gt; by 48 state attorneys general plus DC and Puerto Rico. That's good. I hope they look into their control of the web. It's even tighter than Microsoft's was in the 90s, which got them into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1995/08/22/121895.html?pageNumber=53&quot;&gt;consent decree&lt;/a&gt; with the DoJ. Google is doing it with far less visibility, so they're getting away with more. The web is public domain. They appear to have no fear of being stopped, and that's a bad thing. I've written it up in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;white paper-like doc&lt;/a&gt;. I've been beating this drum because it's so important that we preserve the resource. We'll never be able to rebuild it if they succeed in taking it over the open web.</description>

			<description>Sometimes I can be very wrong. In 2001 I thought &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/07/06/theMicroChannelArchitectur.html#3&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; was going to take over the world with Passport, .NET and HailStorm. Not sure what happened to Passport, their identity system, it's probably the legacy format of their current online systems, or long-ago deprecated. .NET is doing fine, but in no way dominating the world. And HailStorm was pure vaporware. A dream built out of hubris not software. I'm not even sure what it was supposed to be. The world did need a storage system (still does) attached to an open identity system, by a simple but powerful scripting environment, but in 2001, not from Microsoft. No one trusted them. BigCo's don't appreciate how much trust comes into it, they must think developers &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+&quot; locked+in+the+trunk&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;locked in the trunk&lt;/a&gt; while they drive the car. Heh. No.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tone-deaf&quot;&gt;Tone-deaf&lt;/a&gt; means something in music, but in politics it's bullshit. There are lots of points of view. Saying something is tone-deaf means you don't agree. Why can't you just say it that way? Why do you have to insult the person? To me it says you're not really confident in your own beliefs. In speech the only thing that's really tone-deaf is saying some else is tone-deaf.</description>

			<description>Blocking people from reading things posted publicly is weird. You can always get around it by viewing the same page in a different browser or an incognito tab. Something is public or not. If it's public it seems everyone should just be able to read it without phony barriers.</description>

			<description>One of the great things about having the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email service&lt;/a&gt; in place is that I'm hearing from friends who are now reading my blog, maybe for the first time. Anyway I heard from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon&quot;&gt;Chris Lydon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/03/07/scott-love-the.html&quot;&gt;Scott Love&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/08/144021.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's piece&lt;/a&gt; about the hero-making of big-dollar academic institutions for the reputational rehabilitation of billionaires. I've collaborated with both &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)&quot;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, on successful projects, decades apart. They know what can be accomplished with very little money. The money can buy you the illusion of creativity, the actual creativity is invisible to the eye, but is reflected in the product of the work. There's an inverse relationship often between appearances and what comes out the other end of the innovation assembly line.</description>

			<description>Joi Ito is here to stay on the web. How do I know? Earlier today I was searching for a reference to my longtime friend Scott Love. Scott worked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt;, the outliner and presentations company I started in the 80s. He went on to write his own outliner. Joi used it. How do I know? Joi is a blogger. He wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/03/07/scott-love-the.html&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, the way bloggers do. He told you how he heard about it, what it was like talking with Scott, and what the product was like. His body of work is there and useful.</description>

			<description>I'm starting to catch up on binge-watching. I saved the whole of season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt; to watch in a binge. It was good. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdZTGj3xag0&quot;&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/a&gt;, omg. I won't spoil it, but she plays a character from my neighborhood growing up. Something bad happened in her life, and we'll never know what role she played in it. The story is just as gripping as the previous season, and the acting superb. In other binges, I've started to work on season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;, just watched the first episode. I'm going to savor this show. One of the characters reminds me of Jason Calacanis for some reason. Just as the main character of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despicable_Me&quot;&gt;Despicable Me&lt;/a&gt;, Gru, reminds me of Mike Arrington, even though he looks nothing like him. But I digress. I still have to do something about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black&quot;&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;. I stopped watching toward the beginning of Season 5. I have no idea how to get back up to speed. Same with the third season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Counterpart&lt;/a&gt; -- both of which were very entertaining, but complex. Getting back up to speed in multi-season shows is hard. It might be a good idea to have a digest, maybe in written form, to help you get rebooted in these shows.</description>

			<title>The heroes machine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where are we left after Joi Ito &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/190907/p8#a190907p8&quot;&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; yesterday from positions at MIT, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/knightfdn/status/1170465388372594693&quot;&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/macfound/status/1170443088055144448&quot;&gt;MacArthur&lt;/a&gt; Foundations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NYTimesPR/status/1170461340768645120&quot;&gt;the NY Times&lt;/a&gt; and Harvard?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The scandal exposes how money is used by the very rich to help erase reputations they got as they got so rich.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's why I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/01.html#a115048&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; a week ago that the last thing I want to see is a Netflix series on the life of Bill Gates. I know the things he did to make his money. I didn't begrudge him his initial victory. He was tougher and smarter and took bigger risks than his competitors. He stared down IBM, when they deserted him, and won. That's a story that should be told, because winning there, the way he did, was heroic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What Gates did after he achieved dominance is where it was no longer a matter of skill and determination. It was the old layer of technology trying to prevent the new layer from booting up. As the web was growing, when the people behind it were academics with little funding and inexperienced Silicon Valley startups, he tried to kill it. And he didn't give up. It was Bill Gates vs the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The future needed our protection, but the press and government, and yes -- institutions like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab&quot;&gt;MIT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brockman_(literary_agent)&quot;&gt;Brockman&lt;/a&gt; -- they feed off the vast fortunes people like Gates accumulate. To them it's their blood, they operate a huge PR machine and a vanity press for billionaires, and unless the ones that make the huge money need redemption to become saints, like latter-day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2013/08/01/207272849/how-andrew-carnegie-turned-his-fortune-into-a-library-legacy&quot;&gt;Carnegies&lt;/a&gt;, they won't get to be the heroes that reputation launderers like Negroponte and Joi Ito create.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is too dirty that their help can't be bought to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And what suffers? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article232636792.html&quot;&gt;young&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CarlosLozadaWP/status/1170677124333785089&quot;&gt;future&lt;/a&gt;. That is way too big a price to help Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates and probably many many others, try to make themselves the heroes of our age. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My prescription? An austerity program at places like Harvard and MIT. Create new media and see how &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; money you can spend doing it. Join the open source development world. Let us help you. Stop worshipping the billionaires, they don't know how to get us out of the corner we're in as a civilization and honestly it doesn't seem that they want to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="What Gates did after he achieved dominance is where it was no longer a matter of skill and determination. It was the old layer of technology trying to prevent the new layer from booting up.

			<description>Ultimately, imho -- the people who rise to the top of academic institutions are the ones who make donors feel good. The challenge is to use your agreeable nature to protect and promote innovators who generally rub donors the wrong way.

			<title>The motivation for persists</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Phil Windley, a developer friend from Utah, asks via email about the motivation for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/persists&quot;&gt;persists package&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was writing a bit of example code for another package I am working on. I iterated over it, factoring and simplifying until it was really easy to see what's going on. I pride myself on really easy to follow example code, because it's what I most need when I'm trying to figure out a new package, I figure it'll help others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to add a small feature that required a tiny bit of persistent data, a serialnum. Of course this comes up all the time, I have a standard practice for it. But in this example, the persistence code &lt;i&gt;doubled the size&lt;/i&gt; of the demo, and hid the elegance and simplicity of the code I was trying to demo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Frontier, of course, saving a scalar with persistence is simply a matter of assigning a value to it. The kernel takes care of everything else. All the years I've been working in JavaScript, I've been searching for that simplicity. The language is so hackable I figured there must be a way. And when they added the Proxy feature, it did become possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what persists is. It makes persistent values almost as simple as Frontier. The point is simplicity and factoring overhead from your mainline code into a package. And that's a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To really bring it home, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/examples/mailservice/mailservice.js&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt; I was talking about, after I used persists. And here are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/commit/38504e097ec2df29b2c242bac3d452ae23a808d2#diff-69efe25839c01bf1a31a1d98f9f793d9&quot;&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt;. And btw, I have an even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html&quot;&gt;simpler approach&lt;/a&gt;, but I can't do it unless I can change the JavaScript language spec, which probably isn't going to happen. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🙏&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you have questions about persists, this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/persists/issues/1&quot;&gt;good place&lt;/a&gt; to post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think I've got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/persists&quot;&gt;persists&lt;/a&gt; wrapped up pretty well. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/persists#readme&quot;&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/persists#a-simple-app&quot;&gt;simple app&lt;/a&gt;, and I walk through it explaining what it does. And a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/persists/blob/master/examples/lotsofobjects.js&quot;&gt;complex app&lt;/a&gt;. Finally solved the puzzle, how to get object database-like persistence using native JavaScript objects, using JavaScript object syntax. The key idea is that the objects are shared between the levels. One level takes care of persistence, the higher level keeps track of its data and doesn't care how it persists. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/15/0640.html&quot;&gt;pestering&lt;/a&gt; friends about this for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+persistent+javascript&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awbjs&quot;&gt;Allen WB&lt;/a&gt; said look at proxies. It took a few years, but I got there.</description>

			<description>It's remarkable how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614264/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joi-ito-nicholas-negroponte-funding-sex-abuse/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; the MIT Media Lab is in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/190905/p22#a190905p22&quot;&gt;obsession&lt;/a&gt; with money from billionaires. An organization at MIT focused on tech and media could do a lot of good, for very little money, by sending technologists into the world with a mission to create great open tech for the people. Instead the focus is on what percent of the world's billionaires you're on a first-name basis with, laundering their reputations by accepting their money. The work they do at the Media Lab is almost incidental. I understand why normal people feel so much disdain for the elite, because the dishonesty shines through, even if the details remain hidden.

			<description>The other day I wrote about an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/04/141020.html&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; for persistent objects in JavaScript. It was dream of course because it requires a change in the language. So then I wanted to see how much of it you could implement with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy&quot;&gt;Proxy&lt;/a&gt; feature, which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/122&quot;&gt;explored&lt;/a&gt; with Ted Howard thirty days ago, and it turns out -- quite a bit!

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://deadspin.com/mets-ninth-inning-bullpen-implosion-special-even-by-met-1837857317?scrollnorefresh=1&quot;&gt;The Mets lost&lt;/a&gt; last night in an unbelievable way. I watched most of the game, switching back and forth between it and MSNBC. I started to go to bed after the Mets batted in the ninth, I thought for sure the game was over, merely a formality to get the last three batters out. The Mets &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/mlb/game?gameId=401076805&quot;&gt;were ahead&lt;/a&gt; 10-4. The home team, the Nationals were defeated, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/04/turner.png&quot;&gt;humiliatingly stupid way&lt;/a&gt;, not just hitting, ptiching and base-running. Well by the time I got upstairs, with the game on my iPhone, I couldn't believe the score. Runners on second and third, tying run at the plate, one out. I thought well either they win or lose, I'm going to wash up, take my vitamins, brush my teeth, etc. Just as I was grabbing the toothbrush, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/video/edwin-diaz-in-play-run-s-to-kurt-suzuki&quot;&gt;walk-off home run&lt;/a&gt;. I decided then and there that this was the end of the Mets season. It was a nice run, August was great, but there's no way a team comes back from this. Not even the Mets.</description>
