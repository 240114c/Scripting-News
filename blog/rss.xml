			<description>You know that old story about how first they came for the immigrants, but I wasn't an immigrant so I didn't worry about it? That's a good way to view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/abortion-law-alabama.html&quot;&gt;news from Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, imho.</description>

			<description>Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;http://howardweaver.com/styled-12/index.html&quot;&gt;Howard Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, a long-time friend, journalist, asked &quot;What is an open identity server?&quot; I was able to answer the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1128674591201689602&quot;&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Briefly it's the part of Twitter that knows you're @howardweaver and I'm @davewiner. I need that in my software too. Rather than build my own, and make users establish a new &quot;identity&quot; for my apps, e.g. -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;,  I just use Twitter's. That's the open part.</description>

			<description>I used to sit in my hot tub in Calif, looking up at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_oak&quot;&gt;live oak trees&lt;/a&gt;, and tried to convince myself that I owned them. I said to one tree, &quot;I own you.&quot; The tree laughed: &quot;You just got here. I have been here a hundred years, and I will be here hundreds more after you're gone.&quot;</description>

			<description>One of my reasons for moving to the country was to have a real kitchen and to re-learn basic cooking. I used to love preparing meals. Last night I hit a milestone. A very simple dish, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/15/dinner.png&quot;&gt;broccoli, carrots&lt;/a&gt; -- cooked lightly, then lightly covered in olive oil, soy sauce and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha_sauce&quot;&gt;Sriracha&lt;/a&gt;, over rice. Just perfect. Previous iterations were basically edible. Working my way up to a full dinner for guests, maybe by Thanksgiving. But for now I'm happy to be eating well. Living in NYC made it too easy to order delicious food that was too greasy and too much and made me unhappy.</description>

			<description>I'm watching the HBO miniseries &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/a&gt;. The USSR had a lid on leaks, but the world was figuring out what was going on because the radiation spread far outside the USSR. There was huge fear that this was the end of everything. I don't recall how we survived.</description>

			<description>I made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread&quot;&gt;davefeedread&lt;/a&gt; package a little more robust. Under some circumstances the lower-level feedparser package will return a length for an enclosure of &quot;None&quot;. This is not what my apps were expecting and as a result we missed a bunch of podcasts due to errors. Zero is much easier to handle, and there really is no correct value if the length is omitted, since it is required by RSS 2.0. But what can you do -- this is the real world, and it happens. Examples -- Radio Lab, Here's the Thing. I added a simple workaround. If the value is None, we set it to 0. Result: More podcasts to listen to. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Twitter is a great open identity server. I use it in all my apps. If they added simple storage, we'd be looking at a new world of networked apps. This was Jack Dorsey's original idea for Twitter as a platform, btw.</description>

			<description>You have no idea how strange it was to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1122702732090138625&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt; in a comedy skit on Samantha Bee's show. If you had asked me to predict the probability that I would see that in my lifetime, I would have said infinitesimal, such a small number it's impossible to measure. Life is strange. And when people say things like &quot;We all know X&quot; -- remember this story. You never really know for sure what can happen.</description>

			<description>I watched last night's Game of Thrones instead of Game 7 of the playoff series between Toronto and Philadelphia. No regrets, I had more invested in the GoT story than the story of either of the NBA teams, though I do have a thing for the Sixers and respect the hell out of the Raptors. When I came out from GoT the first thing I checked was the NBA schedule, and I could see that Toronto had won. But, like everyone else, I was struck to learn &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; they won. So many stories in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/13/waitingForTheResult.png&quot;&gt;fantastic photo&lt;/a&gt;, taken while the stars of the both teams wait to see if the at-the-buzzer &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kawhis-buzzer-beater-might-be-felt-around-the-league/&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; would go in. It would bounce four times before they knew the result. So much pent up energy in this, one of the greatest sports pictures of all time. Wonderful.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/024939.html&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; was in my dreams last night. I remember one part. She's in the other room lying down reading, something she did a lot, and for some reason I called her on the phone. We hadn't spoken in a long time. She said &quot;an angel is calling&quot; in a very sentimental way. She never said stuff like that. This morning I wonder maybe I was the one who died? Happy Mother's Day mom, where ever you are, or where ever I am. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

She said &quot;an angel is calling&quot; in a very sentimental way. She never said stuff like that. This morning I wonder maybe I was the one who died?

If you roll your mouse over &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/12/permalink.png&quot;&gt;the time&lt;/a&gt;, next to the author's name, you'll see it's a link.

That means you can point to a comment the same way you'd point to a blog post. It will continue to work even after there's a rollover of the chat stream (a fresh start that I'll do periodically). However story pages will not survive moderation, so this isn't a place to write a blog post.

			<title>My Facebook Manifesto</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're getting the downside of networking and not enough of the upside because progress is stalled due to Facebook's dominance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they had created a thriving ecosystem not underneath them but alongside them, no one would be talking about about breaking it up, it would already be in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everyone who's ever pursued a monopoly in tech should see (now) why it's a dead end. And people who in their hearts felt the web should stay open, you were right, it's the only sustainable option.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's easy and economical for Zuck to give up his monopoly and it doesn't require divestiture or breaking up. And it's necessary to get the web growing again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Key point: We have to have more than Zuck's mind working on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Ask the big search engines to add another &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/11/searchCategories.png&quot;&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; to search -- Podcasts.

			<description>I haven't listened to a podcast in two weeks, not even the Daily podcast. I plan to come back. But right now I'm reading an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker&quot;&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; about Robert Moses and how power works. I had read it a long time ago, before I knew much about power myself. It's interesting in new ways at the other end of my life. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>In 1985, Apple did something bold and brave with the Mac, they included &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleTalk#AppleTalk&quot;&gt;networking&lt;/a&gt; with every Mac they made. This meant that if the APIs were easy for developers to adopt, to build on, the Mac would have gotten a huge wave of Mac-only networking software. There's no doubt that in my mind that the web would have booted up on the Mac, possibly years before it did on the NeXT platform. But the Apple networking APIs were impenetrable, so only a few developers, who probably secretly got help from Apple, or who were especially good at reverse-engineering APIs, managed to break through. Too bad, because when the web finally came along in the early 90s it didn't have a GUI, it wasn't WYSIWYG, and since this was the basis of Mac software, it's why Apple was slow to adapt to the web, even if their developers, now liberated from Apple's lock-in, rushed to adapt and led the early web. Apple definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing&quot;&gt;benefited&lt;/a&gt; from their decision to build-in networking, but they could have hosted the web, and we all would have gotten the benefit of the Mac user interface. The web would be very different, and imho much better. This should be a lesson for Facebook. If they bend down to be &lt;i&gt;part of the web&lt;/i&gt; instead of casting the web aside, long-term they'll own a huge share of the growth that comes from lots of independent developers working alongside them.</description>

			<description>Things have really changed politically in our country, but it doesn't &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; that way. Maybe each of us should take responsibility for changing something really big about ourselves, how we present ourselves to the world, to mark the change so we all feel it more.</description>

For example, in T&amp;B there are people and animals, as in Bojack, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/plantAsACharacter.png&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; also have intelligence and speak and have legs and can walk and go places (and are teenagers). Also they include little bits of non-animated &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/humanInTuca.png&quot;&gt;human stuff&lt;/a&gt; in it. And the snarky Easter eggs are even better. But it's also got a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli&quot;&gt;Studio Ghibli&lt;/a&gt; in it and trippy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away&quot;&gt;Spirted Away&lt;/a&gt; type stuff.

Also they include little bits of non-animated &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/humanInTuca.png&quot;&gt;human stuff&lt;/a&gt; in it. And the snarky Easter eggs are even better. But it's also got a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli&quot;&gt;Studio Ghibli&lt;/a&gt; in it and trippy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away&quot;&gt;Spirted Away&lt;/a&gt; type stuff. I love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://deadline.com/2019/05/tiffany-haddish-ali-wong-tuca-and-bertie-interview-tribeca-1202605920/&quot;&gt;actors&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I've been saying this for many years -- I wish as part of the publicity materials for shows, movies, even products, they produced standalone images that have a transparent background, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/bojack.png&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for Bojack. I love putting them in the right margin when I'm writing about your product. It's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; for you.</description>

			<description>I use Facebook the same way I use Exxon. I need their product to get where I want to go. I don’t like what the products do to the ecosystem or the crazy attitude of the people who run the companies. But I don’t have any power over that.</description>

			<description>At least we know one leading Democrat won't compromise. Elizabeth Warren said it so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/05/07/warren_defends_call_to_impeach_trump_no_political_convenience_exception_to_the_constitution.html&quot;&gt;clearly&lt;/a&gt; last night on MSNBC. Our moment of compromise will come when we are forced to take a loyalty oath to Trump. You may be sure you won't do it, but in the moment you will have a conundrum as to whether or not you sign the pledge.</description>

			<description>New &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=chat&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; feature. Ted posted a chat message yesterday that I didn't see for many hours. Not good. Disqus used to send me an email message when a new comment is posted. So I added that feature here. I now get an email when a message is posted. So I should be responding more quickly, if I have a response that is. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman&quot;&gt;Paul Krugman&lt;/a&gt; has been writing for decades about how Repubs are wrong and hypocritical about economics. He's very persuasive and of course I totally agree. Now the Dems have been wrong too, also for decades, about not standing up to the Repubs breaking our system of government. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-obama-wall-street-torture.html&quot;&gt;every step&lt;/a&gt; they choose to ignore and overlook instead of investigating and fighting. It happened regarding torture in Iraq, the financial crisis, the Merrick Garland nomination, etc. It'd be interesting if Krugman could write one of his famous pieces about the Dems. Repubs aren't listening to him, but Democrats are. There is no option now but to stand up for the Constitution, or there will be no election to win in 2020. They can't put it off any longer, this is the end of Congress if they don't. Someone outside of government who people listen to, needs to say this.</description>

			<title>Feedback for WAMC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have something to say about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wamc.org/&quot;&gt;WAMC&lt;/a&gt;. Every time I tune in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wamc.org/topic/alan-chartock-message-president&quot;&gt;Alan Chartock&lt;/a&gt; is talking. He's their expert on everything, but all he says are platitudes. The first time he got my ire up he said &quot;Everyone knows that X&quot; and it pissed me off because X is not true (imho). He likes Joe Biden and Israel. He talks and talks and no one interrupts him, no wonder -- he owns the station (or so it seems).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to listen to NPR to retain my sanity in the morning over coffee while getting my mind organized for the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't believe everyone doesn't hate him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Someone tell him to chill out please. Or retire. Yeah that would do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: There was a Law &amp; Order &lt;a href=&quot;https://lawandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Seed&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; where it turned out that a fertility doctor had been impregnating patients with his own sperm. There was a small army of his children in NYC. Not sure if it was based on a true story. Anyway that's what it's like.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Living in Manhattan, with no car, I got used to FreshDirect where you order groceries via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://freshdirect.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and they deliver what you ordered the next day. You develop a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/07/freshDirectList.png&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of items you buy regularly, and shopping is a matter of reviewing that list, and re-ordering the things you need more of. Very efficient, and I rarely forgot basic items, because they floated to the top of the list. Now I'm shopping in grocery stores, basically walking around through their warehouse in realspace, doing the job FD employees do in NY, and while I like the experience in general, I often forget to restock things I've run out of. Which makes me wonder why stores don't adopt the FreshDirect user interface, let me shop for basic stuff from home via the web, even if they can't deliver.</description>

			<description>My friend NakedJen who to me is the Mother of Dragons, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/11/16/nakedjensBlissBag&quot;&gt;magical person&lt;/a&gt; who can do the stuff only Daenerys Stormborn can do (and more), is now watching Game of Thrones, finally. She's in season 1. I can't say any more (here) because I know she reads this blog. I envy her, I would love to never have watched the first few seasons so it could all be new again.

When you get to the bottom of the screen the cursor moves to an object that is not visible. I want to scroll the window vertically to make the cursor object fully visible. If you look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/playingcards/code.js&quot;&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see a routine named  &lt;i&gt;scrollToMakeVisible. &lt;/i&gt;The goal is to fill in the body of that routine. I've opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/116&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.</description>

It means an end to co-equal branches. It's a license for the executive to do whatever it wants. I wonder if people who think there's a good outcome possible from non-impeachment have thought this through. Trump may or may not be a bumbling fool with evil intent. But it's not hard to imagine a more competent fascist taking his place, and then what.</description>

			<description>I find GORKA! fascinating because of his utter depravity and smarminess and the fact that some people obviously feel he is educated and sophisticated. I like GORKA! even better when he is being humiliated &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/existentialfish/status/1125414269179310082&quot;&gt;to his face&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I tried cross-posting but it doesn't work. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/09/04/endingAnExperiment.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; it up. The problem is that the silos don't support cross-posting in any direction. They really want to be worlds unto themselves. The web, as far as they're concerned, isn't worth supporting, even though they couldn't exist without it.</description>

			<title>What pisses me off</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You know what pisses me off. A guy writing the best political blog out there, on Facebook. So after I read his piece and think &quot;everyone should see this&quot; I can't send the link outside of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have this incredible thing called the web and we don't use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same thing when a person I admire and who is doing great stuff to help keep the web open, writes her latest report on Medium, where it is already behind a paywall and will likely disappear the day Medium runs out of ideas how to monetize news.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
