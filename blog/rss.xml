			<description>In school, it was puzzling to learn about the rise of Hitler. Why didn't the people rise to stop it? We're living the answer now. They didn't believe what was happening. They thought the nightmare would end without them having to do anything. That's the mistake we're making too.</description>

			<description>I watched Maddow last night, saw it with new eyes. What Trump said isn't outrageous, it's the present, it's the truth, it's the future. It doesn't matter what the FBI thinks.</description>

			<description>Google treats the web as if it were its own private platform. Chrome is always generating new errors. Okay they don't like the way software I wrote five years ago works. I need a browser I can recommend that thinks the open web is not a corporate platform. Not Mozilla, btw, they generally do what Google says.</description>

			<description>At the Great Democratic Debate, one of the candidates should suggest they draw straws. Everyone who picks a short straw withdraws from the race, then and there, and endorses the candidate with the long straw. That would be the Democrats finally waking the fuck up and leading.</description>

			<description>I started watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_They_See_Us&quot;&gt;When They See Us&lt;/a&gt; three times. I'll get through it. But it is so anger-making to watch how the cops treated the kids and their parents. If you believe we can depend on the basic goodness of people, well, clearly we can't.</description>

			<description>The news should reflect what's obvious about what the next steps are for our increasingly authoritarian government. Project out from here. When do the loyalty oaths start for government employees? Members of Congress.? The courts? Teachers? You and me. When do the concentration camps for American citizens start? We need a thread that isn't looking backward as the news mostly is, but is focused on the present and near-future. That would help people see why impeachment is so important. Didn't they see it coming? Answer: They &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_wise_monkeys&quot;&gt;didn't want&lt;/a&gt; to look.</description>

			<description>You know the old idea of visualizing the audience as naked to overcome stage fright, analogously consider that every bit of hate you get on Twitter comes from an algorithm, a few lines of code and records in a database, not from your mommy or daddy, or even the police. You are not actually being threatened, even though it may feel that you are.</description>

			<description>One thing I learned from being an entrepreneur and software developer is that you have to listen. Put aside any anger or fear coming from the person with the idea, sometimes the best ideas come with angst. Journalism circles the wagons, listens only to ideas of the sort &quot;Oh woe is me, we have been unfairly treated by tech, give us your money, or else.&quot; I've been hearing this since shortly after the web came about. Oddly the people who turned me on to the web were journalists They were excited about this great news distribution technology. That's the right way imho to look at it. The money is there. Look at all the money Facebook and Google make. A big secret of business is so obvious people sometimes miss it. If you are being hurt by a competitor, think about doing what they do. It's hard to listen to them, but then no one is entitled to tune out while their livelihood is undermined.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/gentleman-jack-season-1-finale-recap-episode-8.html&quot;&gt;season finale&lt;/a&gt; of Gentleman Jack was just lovely. Not too perfect, because there are big clouds on the horizon, but a sweet ending. Most people I know didn't see it, but it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/a&gt;, both from HBO are the highlights of the year. And of course I'm going to binge season 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/big-little-lies/season-2-everything-you-need-to-know-cast&quot;&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt;, when it's done, no matter what. Adding Meryl Streep to the already estimable ensemble is too much to miss.</description>

			<description>I signed up for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/package-registry&quot;&gt;GitHub Package Registry&lt;/a&gt; beta, but wasn't selected as one of the lucky few. I do most of my server development these days in Node, and am of course using NPM. Sometimes it gets flaky, and I keep thinking there's more it can do. Am intrigued with the idea of an integrated package manager and GIT repository. If you have any experience wiht the new GHPR beta, write a post &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/119&quot;&gt;somewhere&lt;/a&gt; and send me a link. I'm really curious.</description>

Make new laws that make lock-in illegal for dominant tech platforms. We've learned this over and over. Tech stagnates while platforms dominate, then there's an explosive new platform, the incumbent tries to kill it, and that slows things down again. Tech has an undeserved reputation for moving quickly. Actually it tears itself apart frequently, the periods where progress can be made are too short, and always comes with backward motion. Other technologies don't this. You can create a treatment for one disease without starting an epidemic of another. You can add air conditioning to bowling alleys without coming up with new rules to the game.</description>

			<title>Elizabeth Warren, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been emailing with longtime friend and open web advocate &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jonudell.net/&quot;&gt;Jon Udell&lt;/a&gt; about my campaign to convince &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; to post her position papers on the open web. Of all the presidential candidates Warren is, imho, the one who would most likely support the open web, and getting her campaign on board would help raise the issue for other American political leaders. I admit I am using the political campaign of 2020 to try to make the survival of the open web a more visible issue. I think it's important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what Jon &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/09/whatJonSaid.png&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, and the questions he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I agree Warren should be on the open web. Now I'm trying to sort out exactly what I think that means nowadays, given the option to use one or another service behind your own domain name. If the campaign asked my advice, what would it be? That's what I'm asking myself. What would yours be? You've said what not to do. But what should they do?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here is the basic criteria: Her position papers should survive the failure of a single company. Currently, Warren's presence, and the presence of many other political leaders, is dependent on the survival of Medium. That's the most important point of failure. It's one thing if we lose Warren's writing, that would be bad enough, but the idea of losing all the political writing, that's an unacceptable risk. It's bad tech, and bad politics, which are increasingly becoming the same thing. And for elected officials it might be illegal. In any case it's exactly what got the Clinton campaign in so much trouble in 2016, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So at a minimum, the Warren position papers should be hosted on a domain that Warren owns. They should have a near-perfect archive, and be ready to redirect to the archive when there's an outage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Jon: I gather from your previous email that Medium offers part of this service. That's a surprise to me. I know they did at one time, but I also heard stories about them canceling the feature, and thereby taking content offline. At least there's confusion as to whether they offer the feature, but here's the really important thing -- they can change their policy at any time, and they &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; changed policies, and business models, many times. So there's no argument possible that Medium has allowed for survival of writing they host beyond their own existence, when there's no guarantee that they, or their survivors would be bound by that commitment. In tech we have lots of experience with companies going back on their promises, esp when they get in trouble and have to refinance. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Probably the best place to host her position papers is on elizabethwarren.com, a site they already own. I understand why they wouldn't want to mess with their fund-raising site, if so create a sub-domain. If they're posting their position papers there, then they should use that URL in their promotions, and then as far as I'm concerned, the problem is solved. They are no longer sending a message to users that Medium is a safe place to post, they're not helping to make Medium &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail&quot;&gt;too big to fail&lt;/a&gt;, which right now, they certainly are. A crash of Medium would be a shock to the web the way the crash of Lehman Brothers was to the financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/forTheRecordBlogging/&quot;&gt;For-the-Record Blogging&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that outlines a strong solution to this problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been thinking lately that when you win an NBA championship, you automatically lose your top two players. There's a new lottery, redistributes the power players around the league, breaks up dynasties. So if Toronto wins, Kawhi will &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to leave, possibly to go to Minnesota or Atlanta. The reason is that dynasties are not only boring they are unsportsmanlike, imho.</description>

			<description>In case you were &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1137350917102231554&quot;&gt;wondering&lt;/a&gt;, the pragmatic cost of an unimpeached criminal in the White House is that there's no reason for him not to continue breaking the law, breaking more laws, ignoring Congress, and the courts, purging disloyal people in the DOJ, FBI, intelligence services, and even cancelling the election which the Dems are counting on winning. You have to put up the barrier as soon as you can, because all the time you wait they become less potent. By the time you realize you should have done it, that you &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to do it, given how things have been going, it'll be too late. He'll just have you arrested for being disloyal. Maybe he's already threatening to do that behind the scenes.</description>

			<description>I'm working on River6, as I reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/04.html#a151733&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. One of the things included with this project is a new river browser, the JavaScript code that runs on the client. There are a few new features here and there, but mostly it's just reorganized and debugged, and hopefully easier to work on. Today I decided to do something bold, I removed all the layers of CSS that define how a river looks. Starting with a clean slate. It had been written by several different people at different times, and in the interim my understanding of how to write modular CSS has come a long way. It was too hard to change things. I wanted to put this note here for this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/08/riverWithoutCss.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; to show what a river looks like without any CSS at all. Not pretty!</description>

There's Trump, the ultimate PHB making a grand royal proclamation, which ultimately forces a fork in Android, so the Chinese add even more malware to the world.

I saw him at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jerrygarciasbrokendownpalaces.blogspot.com/2011/09/academy-of-music-126-e-14th-street-new.html&quot;&gt;Palladium&lt;/a&gt; on 14th St in NYC in 1973 or so. I couldn't figure out what kind of person he was. He was dressed in a long robe, holding a staff like a god, masked, and had huge colorful feathers coming out of the top of his head. Sang all the Dr John hits. He got me interested in New Orleans, where I ended up going to college. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wafb.com/2019/06/06/new-orleans-iconic-musician-dr-john-has-died/&quot;&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; yesterday at 77. His music lives on.</description>

I couldn't figure out what kind of person he was. He was dressed in a long robe, holding a staff like a god, masked, and had huge colorful feathers coming out of the top of his head. Sang all the Dr John hits. He got me interested in New Orleans, where I ended up going to college. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wafb.com/2019/06/06/new-orleans-iconic-musician-dr-john-has-died/&quot;&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; yesterday at 77.

			<title>Why Elizabeth Warren should be on the open web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It bothers me, of course, that Elizabeth Warren, &lt;a href=&quot;https://elizabethwarren.com/&quot;&gt;candidate&lt;/a&gt; for president, is posting her position papers on Medium. I wrote a tweet yesterday, and cross-posted it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/04.html#a174639&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, saying as much. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cbasturea&quot;&gt;Constantin Basturea&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime reader of this blog, did a bit of research and found the Twitter accounts of the people who run the Warren web presence, suggesting I contact them. At first I thought, they won't know who I am, and they might not care about the open web. But then I thought, why wouldn't they care?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of parallels in the ways big tech companies and banks regard their customers, and Warren has been such a pioneer in the reform of banks. It's a bad environmental decision, imho, for Warren to go with Medium, when the open web is just as easy, the results are as good, and the writing more likely to persist. It's worth a careful explanation of why the open web is a better choice for a thoughtful and futuristic campaign like Warren's. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Writing for the record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Senator Warren posts a position paper, it's a matter of public record. It's important that it be accessible for the indefinite future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If she was elected, her consituents would want to see what she promised during the campaign, in her own words, to see how it matches up with her policies as an elected official.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if she isn't elected, it's still good to keep the ideas accessible. The problems probably won't go away, and her proposals might be useful to a future candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Preserving ideas is something the web can be good at, but we have to make the right choices.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Medium is not a good choice for creating a public record.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium could go out of business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Medium went out of business everything published there would go away. This has happened many times in tech, it's the norm. Even successful companies, such as Google, sometimes walk away from existing sites because they weren't profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium does not have a stable business model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their software is good, easy to use, and the resulting pages are easy to read. But this is the only thing that has been stable about Medium since its inception in 2012, as they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/the-long-complicated-and-extremely-frustrating-history-of-medium-2012-present/&quot;&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=0Ob3XLOzO5Hr_QbByIaQBQ&amp;q=medium+pivots+ev+williams&amp;oq=medium+pivots+ev+williams&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.12..35i39.1587.1587..5947...0.0..0.125.206.1j1......0....2j1..gws-wiz.....0.rK_ZPDUKiEA&quot;&gt;pivot&lt;/a&gt; trying to find a profitable business model.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium has a paywall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear whether Warren's posts are behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall&quot;&gt;paywall&lt;/a&gt;, because their policies are not clear, and they change. Sometimes I hit a wall reading a random friend's post on Medium. The paywall is not only an irritant, but it limits access to people who have a credit card and are able to pay Medium for access. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set an example for others&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People look at Medium and if they've been around a while, the questions above all come up, but then they see that a great progressive like Senator Warren is using Medium, so it must be okay. This is not good leadership, especially when setting up and running a blog in 2019 is so inexpensive and easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My politics happen to align pretty well with Warren's, but even if I were a conservative Republican, I'd want to help get Senator Warren on the open web, because it's that important to have a serious presidential campaign take a leadership position on the independence of people who write on the open web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/09/143335.html&quot;&gt;follow-up&lt;/a&gt; to this post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been working on the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html&quot;&gt;River&lt;/a&gt; product. This time I'm using a MySQL database. Three tables -- feeds, items and subscriptions. The folder structure is exactly as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/09/0995.html&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt;, except there is no data folder (the data is in the database). I am still a relative newbie in SQL databases, but I think this model works. I'm documenting as much as I can and of course I will release the Node.js source. I hope it serves as a basis for distributing RSS intelligence around the net. Last time around (Google Reader) we centralized. That was a mistake. If enough people run instances of this database we'll have a less interruptable base of functionality. I want to try out more new ideas as well. We've been really stuck for a long time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If journalism had the ability to look at itself critically, the way it looks at Facebook, they would find a smoking gun in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464&quot;&gt;Les Moonves quote&lt;/a&gt; from 2016. You could argue whether Facebook knew it was profiting from Trump trolling, but there's absolutely no doubt that journalism was. We need a Mueller report on this too. Any journalism outfit could do it, btw. They have access to all the sources. There should be a Pulitzer in it. But of course none of them will do it. it would require an integrity they don't have.</description>

			<title>How Old School works</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My longtime friend Stan Krute sent an email asking how I do my blog. Rather than do a one-off email, I am going to explain it via blog post, so it's documented publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the spring of 2017, I wrote a piece of software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;. It's a Node.js server app that is configured via a big JSON file. It handles incoming REST-style messages telling it to build blogs that it knows about via the JSON file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I write the blog content with an outliner, and the result is a big OPML file. The server software (Old School) knows where to look for the OPML file, via the config.json file. You can use any outliner to edit the content as long as it produces an OPML file as output. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I archive the content of the blog in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see how the content works, going back to May 2017. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &amp;lt;head&gt; elements of the OPML file also configure Old School and it contains information other applications might find useful. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for Old School on my blog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even though Old School is undocumented and unsupported, I did provide an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog/tree/master/examples/helloworld&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt;. Never know when I will need to install a second instance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The outliner I use is called Electric Outliner. I've never shipped it, and don't have any plans to. I got tired of supporting &quot;products&quot; that few if any people use. This, and Old School were the first two products I made just for myself. It's cool, because the users of the product really respect &lt;i&gt;the hell&lt;/i&gt; out of the developer, and the developer knows the users will understand the software even with no docs. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; -- it's very similar to EO, in fact the core outliner is the same code. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I want to attach a video to a post, I add an attribute called &lt;i&gt;urlvideo, &lt;/i&gt;which points to a YouTube file. The runtime of the blog, a browser-based JavaScript app, looks for these attributes when the page is loaded, and builds the necessary structures. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Similarly for &lt;i&gt;urltweet, &lt;/i&gt;which points to a tweet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you put an attribute named &lt;i&gt;flNumberedSubs&lt;/i&gt; on a headline, Old School generates an &amp;lt;ol&gt; element. &lt;i&gt;flBulletedSubs&lt;/i&gt; generates an &amp;lt;ul&gt; element.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you put an attribute named &lt;i&gt;image&lt;/i&gt; on an element, its value should be the address of an image, i.e. something that can be put in the src attribute of an &amp;lt;img&gt; element. Old School adds it to the output with a CSS style of float: right. That's how I create right-margin images that I love so much. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That reminds me, you can use emoji &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;short codes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Old School also supports a glossary, a CMS idea that goes back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/claydataglossary.html&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;. It's a simple two-column table represented in an outline. It does string substitutions of the top-level string with its sub-head's value. The glossary I use for Scripting News is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/misc/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt; in the repo. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about this, post a comment in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/117&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
