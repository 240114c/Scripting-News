			<title>Server outage report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;1:42PM Eastern: I've received several notes from users of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; that the app isn't responding. I looked into it and found that the server it's running on has a full disk. Log files overflowing. Still haven't got a systematic way to deal with that. I just removed all the old log files and now the server has a lot of free space. It'll take a few minutes for everything to come back online, hopefully. Will report here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2:45PM: I think I have the server put back together after the outage. If you have any trouble running &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/104&quot;&gt;report it here&lt;/a&gt;. If you can, open the JavaScript console and look for error messages in red and include what you see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It's interesting to me, as an observer, to see Automattic go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://davisshaver.com/2018/12/04/why-last-nights-surprise-announcement-of-wordpress-5-0-was-a-concerning-decision-by-matt-mullenweg/&quot;&gt;kinds of pains&lt;/a&gt; we went through years ago when releasing major versions of Frontier. It happened in 1998 when we released the first version that ran on Windows in addition to the Mac. And again when we shipped Radio UserLand with integrated blogging and RSS. These should have been times of celebration, and in earlier efforts before we did all our work on the net, they would have. I am impressed with the way the users express their concerns, because (I'm guessing) they have businesses with customers who are going  to be confused. And the angst is probably amplified because the leader of the WordPress community is so accessible. That was the conclusion I came to about the trouble we got for shipping. There's always a reaction among users and developers on new platform releases. Imagine if Steve Jobs had been as accessible as Matt Mullenweg when Apple shipped a version of Mac OS that breaks apps. But he wasn't. In general the leaders of these efforts are insulated through layers and layers. It takes guts for Matt to put himself out there. And at the same time, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1069930276829179904&quot;&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; of his users are legit.</description>

			<title>New stuff to Like</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Changes to Likes&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblikes.org/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; to tie all this stuff together and a new domain, weblikes.org.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/client/&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt; is nice, but it was complex. We needed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/helloworld/&quot;&gt;Hello World app&lt;/a&gt;, so now there is one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples/helloWorld&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; provided, of course. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now that there are two example apps, the repository needed a new organization. There's now an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples&quot;&gt;examples folder&lt;/a&gt; at the top level, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/api&quot;&gt;JavaScript API&lt;/a&gt; is in its own folder. Code to include it must change as well. This is exemplified in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;New options for the JavaScript API: 1. You can omit the word &quot;likes,&quot; as we do on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, and 2. Have the Like bits appended instead of prepended. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/blob/master/examples/helloWorld/code.js&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; in the Hello World app to see how they're set.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Various CSS edits that allow the environment defaults to rule the rendering of Likes as opposed to having the values hard-coded in the CSS for likes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were breaking changes in this release. if you've already deployed, sorry. I haven't heard from anyone who has. If you're depending on this toolkit, great. (No sarcasm.) Please provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/issues/1&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; on the changes and make suggestions or just say hi. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Idea for a SNL skit. Trump, played by Alec Baldwin, sits behind the desk in the Oval Office. Aides around him. He cracks self-deprecating jokes. Praises Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Calls Melania and tells her he loves her. Fires his children. Signs resignation letter.</description>
