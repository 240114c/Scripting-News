			<description>Bill Gates' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&amp;v=W5g4sPi1wd4&quot;&gt;biggest failure&lt;/a&gt; in his words is that Microsoft didn't make Android. Hat's off to him. Most great men when looking back on their careers tend to be less specific in their regrets. But imho he's thinking too small. I think his biggest failure was to miss that at the point Windows became the default platform, the role of Microsoft fundamentally changed, and he fought that and that crippled his company and the market. He couldn't make Android at Microsoft any more than GM could make a Tesla. So imho his biggest mistake was not buying a big stake in Google when they were in the garage. And anything else that looked promising. Also it wouldn't surprise me if he read this. One of his strengths as a leader in the PC business was that he engaged with criticism, and learned from it. Most people in his position failed at that, and that's why he won so big, imho.</description>

			<description>What would you think if in Nazi Germany they had polled Germans on whether they approved of concentration camps? Pause for a moment and realize they are almost certainly doing that now in the US.</description>

			<description>My friend Phil Windley posted a stunning &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/23/utah.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of the mountains in Utah on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BzB8AIjh_0E/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. Breath-taking. My first reaction was &quot;America is beautiful.&quot; Not Utah. i thought about that for a bit. Phil had been traveling in Italy and Switzerland, posting pictures of stunningly beautiful places, most of which could not exist in America. because their civilization is older. Of course Utah is a Republican state. Then I thought why doesn't America market itself to Americans. The whole thing, not just pro-this or anti-that. The things that are indivisible. Like the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. That's America, not Republican.</description>

			<description>An idea for a destination resort. Buy some land in the mountains, build an old-style summer camp but for adults. Sleep on bunks, but they’re nice bunks. Everyone eats together. Arts and Crafts, you go on canoeing trips, softball, hikes, campfires, you can smoke weed and have sex, but you have to keep it wholesome, no orgies, this is summer camp (or maybe you had orgies in summer camp). You get to take a kitten home. And of course the lanyard and pottery you make.</description>

			<description>If you're thinking about doing another format for web syndication, don't. There already are &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/927/&quot;&gt;too many&lt;/a&gt;. In fact if you can think of a way to have &lt;i&gt;fewer&lt;/i&gt; web syndication formats, you'd be doing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitzvah&quot;&gt;mitzvah&lt;/a&gt;. One of the fallacies of tech is that anyone is waiting for you to revinvent something that works, no matter how much people appear to be clamoring for it. I've learned over the years that asking, even begging for a feature or product or incompatible format is not an indication that once available people will actually use it. But developers will have to decide whether to support it, and making developers lives more complicated, esp ones who are working for free, is greedy, selfish and not appreciated. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Everything is a lush verdant green and the sky is full of fog and mist, and the pictures are often stunning, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/21/meadow.png&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;, of a meadow near where I live. No filters, no editing, taken with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-iphone-xs-max-review/&quot;&gt;iPhone XS Max&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>When you buy something online that there is no Consumer Reports or Wirecutter review of, how do you decide what to get? There are a lot of what appear to be review sites on the web, but I guess they're all ads for what they recommend. I don't think the search engines have gotten around to this yet. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=best+bike+cover&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=best+bike+cover&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2868j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;best bike cover.&quot; Which if any of them are serious criticism by people who know the area.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/1141712628928176128&quot;&gt;Mathew Ingram reminds us&lt;/a&gt; that two years ago Twitter said they would revamp their verification program, but they're still doing it on an ad hoc basis. Maybe they should do what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://moversguide.usps.com/mgo/disclaimer&quot;&gt;US Post Office&lt;/a&gt; does when you register a change of address. They charge $1 on your credit card. That in turn gets them your real name and address. That's the information they needed, and it's verified to the extent that the credit card company can verify it, and it seems that's also the information that Twitter needs, at least for people. Not so sure about companies.</description>

			<description>If I were in charge of a search engine, I'd notice if someone does a lot of searches on a specific site, and increase the rank for that site in subsequent searches by that person. It's 2019. It seems search should be at least that smart by now.</description>

			<description>Sometimes I unfollow people on Twitter if I feel there's no chance of me being heard if I respond to what they said, esp if I often want to respond, not in the negative (that's another reason to unfollow) but to add a perspective or offer additional info. It's hard to explain, perhaps, without giving an example, and I don't want to do that because I have nothing against the person I'm unfollowing, it's just that their Twitter presence has gotten so big, or perhaps they've muted me, for whatever reason they don't seem to be able to hear me. I seem to only do this with people who I at one time considered a friend. I guess there is a state of friendship that could be described as &quot;on pause&quot; or &quot;in waiting.&quot; That's why I unfollow.  Until today I couldn't put into words why I was unfollowing, but now I can so here they are. :heh:</description>

There's a lot you can do with it. For example, the native file format of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; is OPML. So it's really good for editing subscription lists for feed readers. And editing blogrolls. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://storage.littleoutliner.com/users/davewiner/listicles/listicle1.html&quot;&gt;listicle&lt;/a&gt; tool takes OPML files as input. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/18.html#a164307&quot;&gt;River6&lt;/a&gt;, coming soon, does a bunch with OPML. There's also &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedbase.io/&quot;&gt;feedBase&lt;/a&gt; which will blow your mind if you love sharing subscription lists. Yes there's a lot to discover in OPML-land and more on the way. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I should write a howto to explain editing subscription lists in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/opmlHowto/dave/editorOpmlOrg/editSubscriptionLists.html&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; for the OPML Editor in 2008. It still runs btw, I use it, sometimes even to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/19/nbalistinopmleditor.png&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt; subscription lists. Two key bits for LO2: 1. You can make outlines public. Look in the File menu. 2. And you can edit the attributes of a headline, click the suitcase icon in the left margin.</description>

			<description>Tomorrow is the NBA Draft and the deals are flying. It should be amazing. After yet another Knickless playoff season, it's interesting to see them back in the conversation somewhat. There were a lot of stupid dreams about the Knicks buying a contending team with their cap space. That's off the table because even Kawhi couldn't turn this team into a contender. The Knicks are in a rebuild, have been for many seasons, and no amount of dealing is going to make them a contender. Even the 76ers and Celtics who played it smart aren't contending yet. But at least they give their fans something to root for. The Celtics should be glad to be rid of Kyrie. Last year's team was much more interesting. Re-sign Horford and trade &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward&quot;&gt;Hayward&lt;/a&gt; for draft picks. The most intriguing idea I heard for the Knicks is to pick up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-chris-paul-kevin-durant-dennis-smith-jr-20190618-bwla5ckvffe5zehjyrmse3iqfq-story.html&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt; on waivers (haha not going to happen) or take on his awful 3-year deal, and get them to throw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Capela&quot;&gt;Capela&lt;/a&gt;, say. In return they get a few mediocre young players that didn't work out (pretty much anyone on the current roster). And then what the hell, sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22carmelo+anthony%22&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; and let him play out his career in the Garden. It's not like anything else is going to happen here for the forseeable future. Sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22jeremy+lin%22&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt; (he can bring his new trophy) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/16.html#a155755&quot;&gt;D'Angelo Russell&lt;/a&gt;, and we might even make the postseason. It'll certainly be entertaining basketball. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🏀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://river6.scripting.com/feedviewer?url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/feed/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, the single-feed view for &lt;a href=&quot;http://river6.scripting.com/feedviewer?url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/feed/&quot;&gt;Berkeleyside&lt;/a&gt;, the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berkeleyside.com/&quot;&gt;local news site&lt;/a&gt; for Berkeley, where I lived a few years ago. It was founded by my longtime friend Lance Knobel. Since River6 is a river, there's less attention paid to the per-feed viewer, but this time I did a thorough rewrite of it, and added a huge optimization. It no longer has to call back to the server to get the JSON version of the feed, it's baked into the page as the server renders it. One more example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://river6.scripting.com/feedviewer?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;single-feed view&lt;/a&gt; for Scripting News.</description>

			<title>Trump is a TV star</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Trump isn't really a presidential candidate and he certainly isn't a president, not as far as the job is designed by the Constitution. Which the begs the question, what exactly is he?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what he is: A TV star.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Specifically a comedian. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Styled after &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers&quot;&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt;. I swear sometimes when I hear Trump talk, something I try to avoid at all costs, I swear I can hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knxuG_hYe-8&quot;&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt; in there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There must be some rude comedians out there who wouldn't mind making a spectacle of Trump hate. And of course hatred for the wimps that vote for him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we don't know if his rallies are still a thing. He's doing one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qVwmfKpps&quot;&gt;tonight&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando. Maybe it'll be a bust. He doesn't really have a new schtick you know. And he wasn't &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; funny in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If he's a dud in his rally, or if he has to amp up the hate to scary levels to get a rise then he's jumped the shark.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But still it wouldn't hurt to put some Trump hate on a stage. Nothing held in reserve. Really vent. We all need to stop being so polite when it comes to Trump. Attack the things he cares about. His net worth. Masculinity. Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the key thing here is the people doing the insults are comedians, not would-be presidents. That's the key. Make Trump all about entertainment by attacking him with entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This started as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1141050003294699520&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fallacies of conservatism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here are two fallacies of conservatism.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/29/humansAreCrazy.html#aHrefhttpenwikipediaorgwikidennislehanedennisLehaneaTheAmericanNovelistInAnAHrefhttpvimeocom17015136interviewaWithChrisLydonToldAStoryAboutRadicalRadioCommentatorAHrefhttpenwikipediaorgwikiglennbeckglennBeckaApparentlyBeckIsInHisMid40sWhenHeTalksAboutTheGoodOldDaysAsLehaneTellsItBeckIsTalkingAboutThe70sNixonKentStateWatergateVietnamSpiralingStagflationTheHostageCrisisOpecItGoesOnAndOnItsConceivableThatBeckDoesntKnowThatTheWorldWasTotallyCrazyWhenHeWasGrowingUp&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; comes from Dennis Lehane, the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island&quot;&gt;Shutter Island&lt;/a&gt;. He heard a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Beck&quot;&gt;TV conservative&lt;/a&gt; talk about the America of his youth, how great everything was, how simple, fun, safe. The conservative was born in the mid-60s. When he talks about his youth, he's talking about the 70s. Nixon, Kent State, Watergate, Vietnam, spiraling stagflation, the hostage crisis, OPEC, it goes on and on. It's conceivable that the pundit doesn't know that the world was totally crazy when he was growing up. Lehane concludes, wisely, what conservatives want is to be children again. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another reason the past is so attractive is we know how it turned out. We survived it, so we can romanticize it. It was safe, even though there were lots of scary things, they were fun because we survived. If we do the same things now, the fallacy goes, we'll be safe once again. Of course it doesn't work that way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Here's a free idea for Twitter. Invent linking inside Twitter. So if I want to point to Kawhi Leonard, I could type his name, highlight it, enter his screenname, click OK. It would make Twitter more readable. Only steal from the best. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

And Kawhi wants one too, he just rented the Raptors for a season (and got paid handsomely for it).</description>

			<description>I wrote a piece in 2014 entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/19/howToAskForHelpWithSoftware.html&quot;&gt;How to ask for help with software&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>The sports god and politics</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Quite out the blue I notice that longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Knaster&quot;&gt;Scott Knaster&lt;/a&gt; enthusiastically agrees with virtually everything I write about the Trump mess. Of course I wonder what the common thread is, and I've come to believe it is that we are both avid sports fans, even though they're not all the same sports.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots of strategy in sports requires compromise. You take one player out and replace with another who is better at defense because what you need right now is a better chance of stopping the other team. It comes at a cost. Yet a sports fan knows there's a randomness to it, or is it spirituality? God sees what you're doing and perhaps (as my dear departed uncle would say) goofs on you. You put in the best defensive squad and they score more points than your offensive-strong team would. Go figure. But you have to be prepared for whatever comes your way and let it guide your thinking. And you always have to be thinking about how fate could deal you a cruel blow, because &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; happens all the time in sport, and of course in life too. And especially in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you don't believe me, look who's in the White House. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Linear thinking doesn't work. If I do X the other guy always does Y is not a good bet. Because the other person is sentient too, and knows you're expecting Y and one time, when it really makes a difference will do exactly what you don't expect because it's what you don't expect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But one thing's for sure. If there are two seconds on the clock, and you're in field goal range, and you're down two points, you go for the field goal. Even though a touchdown is more fun. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Another reason sports fans know how to absorb mistaken thinking. Watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=26947401&quot;&gt;analyst&lt;/a&gt; predict that the Warriors will blow away the Raptors in Game 6, which of course we now know didn't happen. So we know when listening to pundits, or even our own ideas, that nothing like that is actually going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Questions about GitHub Package Registry</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, thanks to the team at GitHub for allowing me to be an early tester of &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-package-registry&quot;&gt;this product&lt;/a&gt;. I'm a regular user of NPM, I publish my own packages, I use it to manage my Node code base. So I'm interested in innovations in this area. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are some very basic questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is it either/or? If I use GitHub Package Registry, can I still access packages in NPM?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I can't, are common NPM packages also available in GHPR? For example, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs-websocket&quot;&gt;nodejs-websocket&lt;/a&gt; in some of my projects.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What are some use-cases for GHPR? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What advantages does it have over NPM?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Drawbacks?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are all questions I will try to answer as I do my investigation, but it would be helpful to get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/120&quot;&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt; from others first.

			<description>In school, it was puzzling to learn about the rise of Hitler. Why didn't the people rise to stop it? We're living the answer now. They didn't believe what was happening. They thought the nightmare would end without them having to do anything. That's the mistake we're making too.</description>
