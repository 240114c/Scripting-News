			<title>'Lock Him Up' is very American</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of things I've always admired about Cubs fans is that when an opposing team hits a home run, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field&quot;&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt; protocol demands that the fan who caught the ball throw it back on the field. It's a sign of disrespect. Basically fuck you and your home run. In baseball, that's cool. And it is in politics too, to throw back at a president who crosses the line of propriety every waking moment, to throw back at him one of the most vile and disgusting campaign slogans ever, in any political system, anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And last night, the crowd at the World Series game in DC did something most of us would love to do if given the chance. With President Trump in attendance, being called out on the scoreboard, they first booed him and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=world+series+game+5+lock+him+up+2019&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news&amp;iar=news&quot;&gt;chanted&lt;/a&gt; Lock Him Up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a Mets fan of course I don't usually have a lot of sympathy for Nationals fans, but this is bigger than baseball. I love what they did.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lock Him Up should be the chant at every sports event until he is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning on MSNBC we get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-lock-him-up-chants-are-un-american-72161349993&quot;&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt; from Morning Joe and Mika saying you shouldn't do that. And then Senator Chris Coons from Delaware, a Democrat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/467698-democratic-senator-criticizes-crowd-booing-trump-the-office-of-the-president&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the same. Respect the office if you don't respect the person. Well fuck you. We've been very civil through this whole process, and we're fed up. If you respect the office so much, Coons, why do you stand by and let him shit all over it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These people have the wrong idea about who we are. We're not children who are misbehaving. We're the electorate of this country, the ones who elected them, and we're saying if you haven't had enough yet, we have. It's time to do what we sent you there to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much damage is being done to our country while pundits and Democrats worry about which side of the plate the napkin goes. When you get him out of &lt;i&gt;our White House, &lt;/i&gt;we'll stop calling for him to be locked up. Do your jobs and until you take care of this just shut up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that the pundits and pols are making such a big deal about this, it'll be interesting to see what happens Tuesday night in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reaction from pols and pundits reinforces that it would be a good idea to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/21/140215.html&quot;&gt;permanent citizen's occupation&lt;/a&gt; of DC. 100K people, always there, walking up and down the mall chanting &lt;i&gt;Lock Him Up&lt;/i&gt; until the Repubs and Dems and members of the Supreme Court get the idea that the people of the United States are fed up not just with him, but with you too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Very few people use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/27/chatTabScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;Chat tab&lt;/a&gt;, so I took it out of the list of active tabs. I'm going to keep looking for the best form of interaction for blog readers. Right now, it seems to be Twitter. The software is still running and can be accessed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;chat.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I'm trying to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Spy&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix, but I keep expecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJZO5Hge2DY&quot;&gt;Borat&lt;/a&gt; to show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb3IMTJjzfo&quot;&gt;up&lt;/a&gt;. I'm watching for it. Anyway it's not that good. What is good that I found at random is the 1998 movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Simple_Plan_(film)&quot;&gt;A Simple Plan&lt;/a&gt;. It got great reviews, but don't watch the trailer, it's a total spoiler. On Amazon.</description>

			<description>All is right with the world. The Knicks are 0-3. Some norms will never be broken, it seems.

			<description>One of the many things wrong with our president is he never wins. He always feels he has to sell. Can you imagine, never a moment to relax, kick back, and savor your accomplishments? What a terrible way to live.</description>

			<description>I had a thought early in the Trump presidency that we should offer him a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Art-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0399594493&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt;. He could have $25 billion cash if he resigns immediately. That number goes down by a billion every month he stays. So he would have a very clear picture of how much the misery of being president was costing him. It would be good for us because it's a small amount of money, all things considered, and if we ever elect a president who would take the deal, we would &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; them to take the deal. I would say we could start there right now. Pelosi gets together with Moscow Mitch and visits the White House.</description>

			<description>I hear some Democrats are getting crazy about the choices we have for president. They're trying to think of someone to come in and save the day. They come up with the usuals, Bloomberg, Kerry, even HRC again. But what about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Inslee&quot;&gt;Jay Inslee&lt;/a&gt;, governor of Washington state? Really smart, thinks well on his feet, confident, has executive experience. Republicans would like him. I don't know about blacks, but he's so much more confidence-inspiring than Biden imho.</description>

			<title>Oh Kyrie get over yourself</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/10/25/kyrie-irvings-boldest-knicks-shot-nets-going-to-take-over-the-entire-city/&quot;&gt;Kyrie Irving&lt;/a&gt; doesn't understand NY sports if he thinks the Nets are going to &quot;take over&quot; the city. He shouldn't say stuff like that if it's really his intention. More likely he'll be traded in two years to Chicago as a backup point guard. People will say, &quot;Remember Kyrie Irving?

NY sports fans, except for Yankees fans who they may actually temporarily get a number of because all they care about is winning, suffer for very long periods waiting for their team to rebound. With the Knicks it seems to never happen. But we suffer anyway. We don't want the city to win Kyrie, we want &lt;i&gt;the Knicks&lt;/i&gt; to win. We're tired of people rubbing their shit all over the Knicks. If you want to be loved by the city, and that's where we begin, you have to understand this. We aren't a prize to be won, we're loyalty that must be earned. Over generations. I went to Knicks games with my grandfather. Not much chance my loyalty will ever switch, Kyrie, but if you want my respect, you shouldn't say stupid shit like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing you may not appreciate coming from New Jersey is just how huge the city is. One basketball player, no matter how great he is, cannot conquer the city. Even the Mets in 1969 didn't. For a few days everyone was happy, then life went on. And we don't like arrogant assholes. Unfortunately the Knicks are currently owned by one, but we hope that is just a temporary thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Over the decades I've spun out a number of individual developers from teams I lead. That started when I sold Living Videotext to Symantec in 1987. I left the company a few months after the deal closed. I wasn't smart or patient enough to try to fit into someone else's company, and I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; I really wanted to do. Here's the interesting thing. When I called back the developers I had left behind, and asked if they would collaborate on interop with my new product, they told me how they work for a big company now and can't collaborate with someone like me. Heh. I knew that they were working on a project with Apple called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock_(framework)&quot;&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, it happens all the time. Once they or I leave the nest, they don't see the value of continuing the collaboration. You'd think, schooled in the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, they'd want to go forth in the world and create more interop, but big companies are a big influence on the people who work there. Even relatively small companies (like Symantec in the 80s) have a lot of inward pull.</description>

			<description>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterfurnace.com/literature/premier/sp1555.pdf&quot;&gt;geothermal&lt;/a&gt; heating and cooling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterfurnace.com/&quot;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt; that works well, is supposed to be efficient (I haven't used it enough to verify) but there is one thing that sucks about it. When it turns on there's a huge slamming sound. Like a garage door. You can't sleep through it. It's jarring even when you're awake. I get mixed opinions. Some say the loud sound is just the way it works, and others say it's wrong, they have used geothermal systems that worked just like any other forced air heating or cooling system. Anyway I have the problem solved for now, at least in October. I don't turn the heat on. I use a space heater at night, and keep the bedroom door closed. But we haven't had a frost yet. Then I'll &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/winter-storm/frozen-pipes.html&quot;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; another answer.</description>

			<description>Reporting on the demonstration put on by Republican House members yesterday, CNN repeated the claim that Repubs were being denied entry to the Shiff hearings. This is why the Repubs do these stunts, because journalism doesn't report the news in a realistic way. The technically correct lead-in would be: &lt;i&gt;Repubs put on a dishonest demo, trying to attract naive press coverage.&lt;/i&gt; Now would be a good time to change the game with Repubs, because they don't have a choice but to accept reasonable rules re lies.</description>

			<description>I'm glad to hear that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1187374005906542592&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; has qualified for the next Democratic debate. I want a candidate that everyone can get behind and that includes Republicans and former Obama voters who voted for Trump. We need a president who wins in a landslide, takes both houses, and someone who knows how to get things done in our political system. When we've elected &quot;outsiders&quot; the results have never been good for us. But Klobuchar's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1187478894045257731&quot;&gt;confidence&lt;/a&gt; isn't there yet. Warren has it, as does Sanders, but neither has the ability to govern with the full support of most Americans. We have to think clearly about how our political system will work after Trump.</description>

I want a candidate that everyone can get behind and that includes Republicans and former Obama voters who voted for Trump. We need a president who wins in a landslide, takes both houses, and someone who knows how to get things done in our political system.

			<description>We need a Wikipedia for news. A landing page for each story, with a summary, and pointer to coverage of all major news sites. As they all adopt paywalls I find it's hard to pick a good story to point to from pieces on my blog. Also I don't like pointing to news pages that are overloaded with crapware. Two bits of prior art. &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/&quot;&gt;Political Wire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt;. I like Political Wire's synopses, and Memeorandum's accumulation of links and tweets. Merge those two ideas, and cover more than politics, that's the basic idea. And also use relatively future-safe server tech.</description>

			<description>We're having the fight to preserve the Constitution and rule of law, right now, today. It's debatable the extent to which the president is above the law, but certainly no one else is.

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html&quot;&gt;Dropbox situation&lt;/a&gt; has become more dire. I pretty much have to stop everything and reconceive how I work with my servers from my desktop. Something broke. I may have a workaround. The lesson is that when you depend on other people's tech, at some point it will fail, and then what will you do. It's hard to have a plan for this kind of outage.</description>

It fits perfectly in the door of a refrigerator. Fill the top with water, put the pitcher in the fridge. It takes a few minutes to filter the water.

			<description>Had a dream last night where it turns out my mother didn't die after all. It was all a big mistake. She was healthy and feisty. Across the street. Of course impossible for me to reach. It was a dream after all.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A permanent citizen's occupation of DC. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We don't leave until Trump does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You sign up for one full day of your choosing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's room for say 100K people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once 100K people have committed for a given day, that's it, the day is full. You have to sign up for another day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You arrange to get yourself to DC and back home. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Carry a sign or wear a button or clothing that says you're there to demand Trump's impeachment and removal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Go anywhere in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/The+White+House,+1600+Pennsylvania+Ave+NW,+Washington,+DC+20500/United+States+Capitol,+First+St+SE,+Washington,+DC+20004/@38.894289,-77.0315506,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b7bcdecbb1df:0x715969d86d0b76bf!2m2!1d-77.0365298!2d38.8976763!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b82921a2cf17:0x482a3f7c10cf8c4!2m2!1d-77.0090505!2d38.8899389!3e2&quot;&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; between the Capitol and the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Flood the zone.

			<title>Too many remotes, still</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This started out being a review of the new Apple TV but the real story is same as it ever was, the living room networking situation is still a mess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/20/tooManyRemotes.png&quot;&gt;too many remotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This tale started when the Spectrum app for Roku broke, I could no longer access my favorites. That meant every time I wanted to find a program, I had to fish through all the channels. I've learned over the years which channels I need, basically MSNBC, CNN, HBO, Showtime, the stations that have Law &amp; Order, channels that carry the sports teams I follow. I imagine it's pretty similar for other people. After all these years you develop paths, and program the system accordingly. At this point, I'm not willing to use Spectrum without favorites. But I have been, and it's unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their support is also ridiculous. They want you to jump through the same set of hoops every time no matter what the problem is. I do what they ask, even though I have a theory about what happened. I'm pretty sure they broke something in an upgrade. I can tell I'm using a new version, they made little UI changes, at the same time Favorites stopped working. That's an Occam's Razor type thing. More evidence -- my Favorites are still there on my iPhone, iPad and in the new Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to why I was interested in Apple TV in the first place. I thought perhaps I could just use Apple TV to access Spectrum, working around the breakage. $199 is a lot of money to spend to do that, but I had an extra HDMI port open on my TV, and I wanted to see what's new there, so why not. I had an old Apple TV, btw -- but the Spectrum app wasn't available for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I've spent a few days with Apple TV, trying to fit it into my routine. But it's not a good fit for mostly UI reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to use their remote. The Roku remote, which to me is the most natural, doesn't work with Apple TV. The Apple remote is innovative. Now I see why they were making a big deal about track pads. But it's slow and error-prone, compared to clicking the arrows on the Roku remote. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But there's the problem now of having two remotes. One of my rules for design is &quot;One way is better than two, no matter how much better the second is.&quot; I bet Apple can prove that their remote is better. But on Rokui I think they should just use the Roku remote. I remember when I first shipped Mac software in 1984, I wanted to design my own (better) user interface. After a year or so we gave up on that and just used the Mac standard interface, even though it wasn't good for what we were doing. The pressure not to make people master a second UI was too great. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And there's a third way -- the Mac mouse and keyboard to control Mac Mini, that I've had hooked into my living room TV for 15 years or so. In the old days it was very useful. These days, I prefer to use the streaming services. I use the Mac for demos, and to show videos of my own, though I could use the Apple TV for that. Honestly I don't know why I have a Mac under my TV these days, but I do.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The net-net is that the Apple TV will not get a lot of use. It doesn't have anything over Roku, and they make me put down the Roku remote and pick up theirs. The Apple remote is weird, it doesn't work the way I feel it should. I'm sure they think I'm wrong, but I remember that I'm the customer, and there's an adage that goes with that too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
