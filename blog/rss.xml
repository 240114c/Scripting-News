			<description>Highly recommend today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/podcasts/the-daily/italy-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; -- an interview with a doctor in Bergamo, Italy. They give an idea of where our hospitals will be in two weeks if we don't lock down immediately. It should be a country-wide thing now. Every day we delay makes it that much worse.</description>

			<description>I met a driver for a big delivery company that does a lot of work for Amazon. He said they can't get gloves or hand cleaners. They know the boxes carry the virus for up to a day. Can't get time off to take care of the kids, so the grandmother is. The union is involved. Sounds like the whole thing is about to be shut down, which of course should not be allowed to happen. We need direct-to-home delivery. It's hugely important. If we had a government this would be high on the priority list.</description>

			<title>Be careful with takeout food</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked a theoretical &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1239548652504391680&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to take a drive today. I like to stop off at a McDonald's and get an Egg McMuffin and a coffee on this drive. The question is -- is this safe? What if someone preparing the food has the virus. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everyone said it was not safe. Later I thought, wait -- the virus has to enter the lungs. If you eat it, it's harmless, it never makes it to the lungs. I asked a doctor friend. He says: You are wrong. Don't eat it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The virus in the food attaches to receptors on the cells of the back of your throat, like any cold virus, and is taken into those cells, after which you become infected. It spreads to your lungs later. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He continued:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it's super hot, that kills the virus. This is what I've been doing: order food, use gloves to touch the packaging. When you get home, open the package, dump the food out onto a plate, then throw that plate in the oven (or if you can heat on the stove, in a pot), then dump the packaging and wash hands. Packaging more likely to have the virus, but heat the food to almost boiling as well to ensure everything is dead. Hot food only, get a hot coffee and ice it yourself. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Someone should make a video game for the iPad (where I play) that simulates a virus infecting the population of Earth. Your job is to keep the most people alive and win re-election for the president (who randomly might be Trump, Obama, Hubert Humphrey or Elizabeth Warren). Or if you prefer, you can crash the civilization, have everyone behave badly, and die horrible deaths. You get to be god, as with SimCity. This might be called SimVirus. I bet someone has already done it.</description>

			<title>Driving notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I took a three-hour round-trip drive today. Had a lot of time to think and figured some stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There should be a clear and simple FAQ page that tells us how to increase the odds that we don't get the virus, but at the same time preserves as much of our quality of life as possible. I will start to write this, and check out what I write with doctors and medical researchers to be sure I get it right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-recession.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. There is no point trying to stimulate the economy. The economy is going down. A lot of companies are going to fail, or emerge very damaged. It's possible whole industries will disappear. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At the same time, other countries are getting back online after successfully controlling the virus. China, Singapore, South Korea and possibly Vietnam, will be careful to disconnect while the rest of the world tries to get the virus under control. It's hard to reboot a down economy. And the longer it's down the harder it gets. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The last two points combined could mean that if the US takes a long time to eradicate the virus, not only will a lot of people suffer and die, when we emerge from the pandemic we will find we have a wrecked economy, and no way to quickly recover. We may be ceding our status as a rich country. I know that's hard to grasp, but there's more at stake here than health, it's our way of life. Americans generally don't understand why we have an elevated standard of living, why the rest of the world tolerates our lunacy, as it escalates. They may love us now, but they'll forget that love when we are a less than first world country. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;New Orleans. Look at how hard it was for that city to get back on its feet, even though it's part of a country that wasn't much affected by Katrina. This time it isn't just one city, it's  the entire western world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Part of the trip was on the New York State Thruway. Happy to report there were lots of trucks on the highway. Presumably they're supplying the stores that have been depleted by hoarding. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I stopped at three drug stores on the trip. I have three items I need to get: hand sanitizer, a thermometer and acetaminophen. I was only able to get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol&quot;&gt;acetominaphen&lt;/a&gt; (aka paracetamol, Tylenol). If you don't have it on hand, you should -- they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus-ibuprofen-french-health-minister-scn-intl-scli/index.html&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; ibuprofen is not good to treat the symptoms of the virus, it actually seems to &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; the virus. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The failure of our government to test in the US is going to cost us trillions of dollars and many thousands of lives. It's the most expensive mistake in American history. All the more galling that it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;obviously&lt;/a&gt; done to cover up for the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-keep-passengers-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-2020-3&quot;&gt;stupid of reasons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the Republicans won't get Trump to resign, we really have to consider other means to make it happen. I am out of ideas myself, but I'm thinking about it. You should too. We've waited too long, and every day we wait means we're going to have to dig out of a deeper hole, and we're going to lose a lot of people. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every store I was in on this trip I had this thought: The virus is here with me. I don't know if that's true, but I believe it is. Thank god you can't get infected by breathing (true, I hope). I washed my hands many times today. :soap:&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Math is running the world now. Covid19 has always been a possibility. And of course our leader is the least math-savvy person you'll ever come across.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;ten-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt; I recorded nine days ago, but didn't publish. At the end I say why. Even I thought it was crazy, delusional. Since then however the story proved true. It's why I write and record my thoughts. I want to remember the perspective of events before, during and after they happen. Listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/11.html#a190333&quot;&gt;James Taylor&lt;/a&gt; talk about his music, the one thing he doesn't mention in the long list of roles music plays in our lives is that it brings old memories to the surface. Listening to his songs takes me back to high school, young love, and the wild random and erratic ideas I had as a teen. Writing isn't as strong a stimulus as music, but it's what I do. And podcasting too of course. Story-telling. So much has happened in the last nine days, every one of the upcoming nine days is no doubt going to be equally consequential. We're living out the crazy consequences of believing somehow as if by magic it all would take care of itself. To keep my fears at bay, to feel strong and consequential, I keep in mind what Syrio says to Arya to say to Death: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEhAFgvwS1M&quot;&gt;Not today&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/contagious-crisis/&quot;&gt;must-listen podcast&lt;/a&gt; from Chris Lydon. The take-away is that our political system hasn't yet realized that we need to go to single-payer for all, now, if we want to have as good an outcome as Italy, which is to say a very shitty outcome. Ours is on track to be much worse because the uninsured can't enter the system, therefore will continue to infect even people with insurance. We're set suffer here in the US a lot more. There will be a debate tomorrow night, and if Biden isn't tuned into this, Sanders is going to clean his clock. And I suspect Biden isn't. And there's a chance that Sanders isn't thinking clearly either, but I kind of doubt it. Nothing focuses the mind like losing. Action-item: before the debate, Biden should give a speech outlining a Medicare-for-all-now program. Give Sanders proper credit. At the debate he can offer to delegate the implementation of this to Sanders. Create unity right there on the debate stage. The Democrats in Congress are not without power. Trump is crazy to think the only criteria people will care about is the stock market. People who unnecessarily lose friends and relatives to this disease are likely to care about that more. Never waste a good crisis. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt; is the time to reform health care in the US.</description>

			<description>On &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/12.html#a174026&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; I recommended listening to the Daily podcast. They had an interview with NYT reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; who explained how they fought Covid19 in China. He was on Maddow that night, and they posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/1238279302468288512&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of his talk on Twitter. If you haven't seen it, stop everything, now, and watch it. You'll get so much more information about what we're up against. China appears to have beaten it. Ultimately we will have to do the same, if we don't want it to spread to everyone.</description>

			<title>Enoch Choi, on the front line</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enoch Choi is a longtime friend, and a doctor on the front line of treating patients with Covid19. This is copied &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102336167134141&amp;set=a.750918057041&amp;type=3&amp;theater&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; his Facebook timeline. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will be swept by Covid19 deaths without more screening so we can know who to focus care for. Without diagnosis, we fly blind and just wait for those so sick to need hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Without more tests, and possible treatment (high flow nasal oxygen, bipap, intubation, remdesivir, convalescent serum, oya1, steroids) what I have for folks is symptomatic (cough suppressants, fever reducers) which I can recommend over the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Telemedicine needs to ramp up so we can keep folks home and prevent waiting room transmission. Stay home and call your doctor. Don‚Äôt come In until you are dying. I can reassure you over the phone. You won't get the swab/test you want unless you are really sick, feverish and a contact of positive Covid19 patient, feverish with severe shortness of breath and chronically ill.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Woodstock notes, day 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers outside &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_County,_New_York&quot;&gt;Ulster County&lt;/a&gt;. I'm going to start posting about my experiences in the area I live now. I think they will be of general interest. There are a number of people locally who read my blog and right now this is the only place I can post them. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hannaford.com/locations/west-hurley-hannaford-21197&quot;&gt;Hannaford's&lt;/a&gt; in West Hurley today. I was pleased to see the parking lot looked fine for a Saturday morning. I got a spot in the second row. Lots of empty spots.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First the general picture. The store is well stocked. Lots of canned goods, pasta, dairy, bottled water, snacks, beer, most everything on my shopping list. Where there were things missing I was able to improvise. The store people were in good spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there was no mistaking we're in a different world now. I could feel this immediately on entering the store. There were empty shelves. Something you don't generally see in America, but you do see in the third world. The produce section was mostly empty. Chicken, hamburger, pork -- mostly gone, what was there were specialty items.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The store is functioning. I had seen people say earlier that it was closed. We have to be careful about that. Before reporting rumors, let's go check it out. That was one of the reasons I went today, to see what was going on. I'm a big believer in people getting the news themselves. This is one of those times when that'll be important.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
