			<description>Apparently several American universities are starting a new double-major, Journalism and Computer Science. I've been asked for input to one of the programs, and have started to think about it. One immediate idea is that the students will be able to write about technical topics without &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+obfuscate&quot;&gt;obfuscation&lt;/a&gt;. Examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hillary%27s+emails&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's emails&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=facebook%27s+api+scandals&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Facebook's API&lt;/a&gt;. They sound like scandals when the NYT writes about them, but what are the actual facts. Believe it or not, they don't say. The business and political press will do what they do, write shallow and inflammatory versions of the story that cast the Hillary and Zuck (and of course others) in the worst possible light. But some of us want facts. At the beginning, so we know if there's anything to the allegations or are they just smears. There are millions of people today who understand what a mail server is, to them it's not a mystery. There should be some news that's written for people with that basic knowledge. The students in this program will be learning how to communicate about technology with a sense that the answers are knowable, and not mysterious. So there should be an immediate benefit to all of us, not just the students, from these programs.</description>

			<description>Another benefit of the new double-major -- journalism will be able to closely examine the behavior of other tech giants, not just Facebook. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has been trying to take control of the networking standard of the web, HTTP. This is not in the public interest, yet there has been no discussion of it in the press. That's wrong.</description>

			<description>I just skimmed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss&quot;&gt;Vice article&lt;/a&gt; about RSS. Up front they make it sound like something dramatic happened. That gravestone image was pretty bad. Someday it'll come back to them. ;-) Anyway there was, momentarily, some drama. The two groups wanted to do very different things. Netscape, as far as I'm concerned, wanted to bootstrap syndication of web content, and that was validated by the enormous popularity of RSS for that application. They had a vision that was right. And yes, they did one day just disappear. I wanted to preserve the progress we had made and build on it. I loved the idea since feeds provided exactly the level playing field I wanted for bloggers and pros. Look at all the good that came from that. Ask TechCrunch or Daring Fireball, Daily Kos or Talking Points Memo. And podcasting. These things all got their start because there was that level playing field. That vision was what was driving me. Ultimately the two forks went their separate ways, as they should have, because we were going different places. It's unfortunate both were called RSS, but if you study the history of tech standards these kinds of tales of woe are more the rule than the exception. It's a good story. I guess, for me it's the ancient past.</description>

			<description>A podcast can be much more than a radio program. Since so many podcasters come from journalism, they miss this opportunity. They have no sense that there's value in the people who hear them.</description>

			<description>Because our POTUS is wildly insane, the United States itself is wildly insane. For example, the big controversy over $5 billion for an imaginary thing is overshadowing a real existential crisis, climate change. OK climate change is hard to grasp. What about all the Americans shooting other Americans. Most are American citizens born and bred in the USA. White Christians. As Trump would say, not our best people.</description>

			<description>I had a thought that &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, probably the longest-running and super excellent podcast that was born out of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/bloggroup/&quot;&gt;Berkman Thursday&lt;/a&gt; group and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;, could be the centerpiece of a blogging and podcasting network. The people who contribute to ROS, their rolodex of interviewees, are incredible people, but here's something that we haven't begun to tap into -- I bet the &lt;i&gt;people who listen&lt;/i&gt; to it are equally incredible. Imagine tapping into their intellect, energy, expertise and vision. Could be very powerful.</description>

			<title>Frontier's S3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know why I didn't see this sooner, but Frontier's object database is the equivalent, in the world we built in the 90s, to Amazon S3, with a lot of advantages, most seeming prosaic, but very important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Names are case-insensitive&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's a hierarchic browser. You can look at two or more locations at the same time. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The browser is an editor. You can change the names or values of things without leaving the context, move an item from one location to another with drag and drop. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It handles small and large objects in the same way. A boolean or number is stored and edited the same way a text object, picture, blob, or sub-table is. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can see values of objects change in real-time with zero clicks. It's esp nice when you can see the values changing in more than one location. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The net&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The net result is you can build higher castles of functionality because so many details are handled by the platform. Errors stand out sooner. If you put something in the wrong place it's easier to see, and correcting it is no more steps than it has to be. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How I came to realize this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One of my development projects was stored in the wrong location on S3. I didn't realize it until I had to type the address in a different context. You see things on S3 through an awkward jumble of inconsistent commands. In Frontier you see your data, and interact with expand, collapse, point and click, drag and drop. Not new ideas. But S3 doesn't use them. They're there for a reason, to make work faster and help you spot errors faster. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Looking at how our HTTP framework, with integrated database access (see above) is Frontier's Lambda. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer Show&lt;/a&gt; discussing The Wall. They talk about it as if it's something that exists or is possible. As I understand it, we already have walls where ever it is practical. It's not possible to put a wall on a river, and much of the border between the US and Mexico is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande&quot;&gt;Rio Grande&lt;/a&gt;. You can't put a wall on the bank of a river. That's ridiculous. So I think before we have discussions about this thing that is supposedly possible, let's first address the question of whether it is.</description>

			<description>Every time I see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; on TV I am so proud to be an American and a NYer. She is the future we deserve. Hopefully many young people will look to her as a role model, and will value intelligence, courage, education and their ability to make a difference. Now, we need journalism of that quality, because without it, politics can never really get out of the sewer.</description>

			<title>Working together, in 2019</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I listen to an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; I feel like writing an email to Chris Lydon and Mary McGrath, saying basically this. Everything your guests say is right on. I get so excited listening to them, they're so smart. But I want to add something, that the technology you're using contains the answer to the most basic problems they're talking about.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened again today on my way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport&quot;&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt;, riding on the E train to the Airtrain to Terminal 5. It was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/post-democracy-in-america/&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; about democracy from December 2016. Not sure how it ended up on my iPhone, but there it was, so I listened. The first guest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Lepore&quot;&gt;Jill Lepore&lt;/a&gt;, had been to the 2016 election postmortem &lt;a href=&quot;https://iop.harvard.edu/get-inspired/campaign-managers-conference/campaign-president-managers-look-2016&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; probably at Shorenstein, where the campaign managers of the major campaigns, 17 Repubs and 3 Dems talked about what worked and what didn't. Not one of them understood, she said (and I agreed), the underlying theme of the election, income inequality, but I believe the answer is deeper. Here's what I see. The world is going to hell, and I'm powerless to do anything about it. My life has no meaning. I want to make a difference but I can't. And the people who can are only thinking about furthering their own careers, not of the big picture. Here it is 2019 and still only a few people see the answer isn't any one of us, it's all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second guest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugo_Mattei&quot;&gt;Ugo Mattei&lt;/a&gt;, a professor from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin&quot;&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt; (where I visited last summer!) got even closer, he said the magic words. He said the secret is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/30/122337.html&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt;. This is my mission. Ultimately that's going to be the way we dig out. That's the real 21st century revolution. Everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22working+together%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; in that direction. Working. Together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lepore also talks about how technology has been a distraction for the Democrats, offering to turn people into &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+slurry&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, and I cheered when I heard that. Of course tech is where I come from, but I went in a radically different direction from Zuck and Bezos. I see technology as empowering us all to take charge of journalism, the same way the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indivisible_movement&quot;&gt;indivisible movement&lt;/a&gt; empowered us to reform politics. You can't have one without the other. Most important we have to stop thinking of journalism as a way for a small number of people to earn a living and do a lousy job of serving the people's interest, and more of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/13/ideaAnIndivisibleGuideForJournalism.html&quot;&gt;civic calling&lt;/a&gt;, a way for all of us to add meaning to each others' lives. Until we get there, we'll keep electing losers like Trump and getting no further in solving the climate and social crises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to shake Chris and say hey you're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message&quot;&gt;doing it&lt;/a&gt;. The elites you talk with, the ones you choose, they get it. Now we just have to put this in practice. We're not getting any younger. Time is running out for our species. You just have to listen to Radio Open Source to hear that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I know I'm rambling. I'm excited. I believe in our future if we can get beyond our individual self-interest and start thinking and acting collectively. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The indivisible movement used the tools of technology, as does Chris's podcast. Remember that when you think tech created the problems, it did. But it also is empowering the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm having an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://via.hypothes.is/http://scripting.com/2018/12/30/124007.html#annotations:eGxEYg1ZEemlC1Pk-PD_kg&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; with longtime friend Jon Udell, but I think we're discussing different things. I'm trying to say we don't have a good way to explain features in languages and environments to people who aren't schooled in the environment. So if I say X has a feature no other environment has, people will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; say it &quot;sounds like&quot; something they've seen in environment A, B and C. But &quot;sounds like&quot; is not good enough. If for example Billy Joel were to claim he had written a great new song, then played it on the piano and it was obviously Hey Jude, you could say Hey Billy that &quot;sounds like&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A_MjCqQoLLA?t=48&quot;&gt;Hey Jude&lt;/a&gt; and you'd have a good idea that you are right. Because music has a universal instrument for sharing tunes, the piano. Software does not. I hoped JavaScript would be it. But maybe it is. I'll try demoing the feature I was talking about in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/30/124007.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; Jon was commenting on, using JavaScript.</description>

			<title>Facebook really is dying</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You know I hate the word &quot;dead&quot; applied to things that were never alive, but in this case I can't think of a better way to say it. Facebook is turning into a ghost town. Here's how I know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite features on Facebook is when they show you every day what you posted there on the same day 1, 2, 3 etc years ago. Through that lens you can see what you were doing on their platform in the past. And these days it's been by far the most interesting thing on Facebook, because for me at least it used to be a vibrant interesting place. Not no more.     &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Caveat: Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One factor in my perception is they shut off my ability to post via their API. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblogging&lt;/a&gt; used to flow through Facebook as it does now through Twitter and RSS. And from that, conversations would grow, leading to other ideas, that led to more posts. But now that that channel is closed off, the activity has moved elsewhere. I understand why they did it, fake news, but it had a cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example in 2017 on this day I posted a comment about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/02/smugPilots.png&quot;&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; that I cribbed from somewhere, with an appeal to understand why people might have voted for Trump, and why it's tragic that we couldn't work together as citizens instead of crashing the country, which is what Trump was going to do and clearly is doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/02/smugPilots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I keep posting everywhere I can to please tell Trump that we're tired of winning as he predicted we would be. Maybe he should retire to Mar-a-lago or Moscow or where ever they'll have him. A low-security Federal prison perhaps? It could be just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQV6CijIzrc&quot;&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's good that Facebook is dying. I do believe in the death penalty for corporations. They have behaved obscenely, without regard for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&quot;&gt;natural resources&lt;/a&gt; that made their company possible. It's as if Exxon could rape the planet without any environmental controls. Not just Facebook -- Google too, and every other tech company, because they're all staffed by the people drawn from the same talent pool. Profits before everything. This is what you get. I don't think the press have fully grokked this yet. They're just nibbling at the edges. Maybe that's all they'll ever do? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_at_Dannemora&quot;&gt;Escape at Dannemora&lt;/a&gt; was worth watching, but it was ungodly slow at times, which I guess is okay because that's how life is in prison, I guess. The Showtime series ended on Sunday.</description>
