			<description>As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/24.html#a180909&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I really liked Season 2 of Homecoming. I noted that it's based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/shows/homecoming/episodes&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; from Gimlet of the same name. I've started to listen to that. It's also very good. I like the whole thing. I think finally I'm going to have to re-watch Season 1 on Amazon, to complete the experience.</description>

			<description>So what a nice feeling that a podcast started all that. I can't recall any pundit saying Podcasting is really great. It's made my life so much better. Hooray for podcasting, or something like that. All they write about is how it's going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=spotify+kill+podcasting&quot;&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;, as if they have a clue.</description>

			<description>In The Atlantic Tom Nichols &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/donald-trump-the-most-unmanly-president/612031/&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that Trump is not a manly president. I don't particularly care for that approach, I think honor and modesty are traits that should apply regardless of gender. We have the president we deserve. We're the country that went to war without a draft, whose citizens got tax cuts while at war, whose citizens expect more of that, to us it's never enough. We expect to be able to inflict chaos around the world and somehow never to be touched by it ourselves. That's why people are out partying with abandon this weekend. They can't imagine they can pay a price. There's a reason Vietnam is responding to the virus so incredibly well and we're responding so poorly. They remember fighting for their independence. To us, independence is a birth right. A distant memory that's become perverted. We have to fight for it again. The virus is giving us that chance. We can't get out of the pandemic until we grow up as individuals and collectively. Trump is the right president for who we are. We won't get a better one until we deserve a better one.</description>

			<description>Taking it easy today, not much writing or programming. The weather has turned gorgeous, real upstate NY summer weather. After a long winter and an even longer almost-spring, including snow on May 9, and a pandemic, it's pretty ecstatic weather, luxurious, great-to-be-alive type weather. It's the contrasts that make the eastern part of the US so much more livable than the west, say I, a native son of the east who spent many years in the west.</description>

			<description>I'm always looking for a good binge, and I found one. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;second season&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/homecoming-season-2-review.html&quot;&gt;Homecoming&lt;/a&gt; is out, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085SW2PFQ/?ref=dvm_us_dl_sl_go_ast_522HO|m_2aaNnzkwc_c436988553276&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwtqj2BRBYEiwAqfzur97nIZDGWdlC1jUutPGDdtug_T52f__inue8ztQOoGDGkQsFlYfKrBoCP3oQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. I started it the other night instead of watching the news. I had forgotten most of the plot of the first season, I remember liking it, but it didn't leave much of an impression. The second season is nicely done, has a Mr Robotish feel, there's a constant stream of twists and surprises, it's fun and so far intellectually gratifying, and it reviews the plot of season 1 as it goes. We have an inkling of how it will end because the first episode is about how it ends, or so we are led to believe. I don't know otherwise because I still have a few episodes to go. But nothing in this show is a straight line, and as I said it's well done. I especially like the end of each episode. They end with a twist, but they stay wtih the scene as the credits roll. I had not seen this technique before.</description>

			<description>Opening churches could flush out the last of Trump's  supporters who'd be ok if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue. The key assumption was that he was shooting someone else, not them. Maybe George Soros or Al Sharpton. I don't think they stick with him if shoots their neighbor from church.</description>

			<description>Read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/2020/05/23/quote-of-the-day-2571/&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; from the Republican governor of North Dakota about masks. A silver lining to the pandemic is the only way out of it is to cut the level of insanity to zero and start acting according to science. There is no other way out of it, assuming you don't want to bet exclusively on a miracle. Either we stay collectively insane, we'll all get the virus, sooner than later, and a shitload of us will die, and the survivors will have a new Dark Ages. If we could only apply the objective brainpower to this problem that we do to a sports game like football or basketball. There is a winning strategy but it requires teamwork.</description>

			<title>Listening to the virus</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The latest save my life &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/534/just-this-breath&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; (must-read) makes me wonder how to listen to people we support. People who are suffering. What conclusions to draw from what they say? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is part of the &quot;we're going to have to learn to live with it&quot; approach, which is another part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;. It's not only about medicine, math, politics, money and power -- it's also about individual people who need -- what? How can we help? How to listen? How can we help? What to say? And how can we help?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The author wasn't able to convey her condition to the first doctor over the phone. I wanted to know how the doctor could do better. Also how the doctor could have made a difference when there was no treatment, at the time -- not sure if there's treatment possible now, even.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's about more than science. It's about us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Node deprecates request</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a technical post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The three words in the title of the post are noun, verb and subject. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's go through them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a popular developer platform with set of common libraries called packages. It's based on JavaScript which is a very popular language. And its power comes from the very deep set of freely usable code you can build on. That part is the reason why I switched to JavaScript in 2013. I wanted to tap into the work of all the other developers using Node. That it was JavaScript was incidental, and honestly the Node platform had nothing to do with it, because at the time I switched I had little idea what it was.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techterms.com/definition/deprecated&quot;&gt;deprecates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a word that platform vendors use when they are going to break the implicit promise that the platform you're developing on is stable. The word &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; implies stability. The fact that platform vendors can do this is one main reason we like to work with open source software, because if we don't agree with what they're doing, we don't have to go with them, which hopefully means they'll be less willing to break us.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is possibly the most used package in Node. I'm not sure. But since Node is used to make servers and one thing servers do a lot of is call other servers to get information, and request is pretty much the only way to do that, you'd have to say even if it isn't the most popular package, it certainly is one of the most important. If you were to remove request almost all Node apps would break. And that is exactly what they're doing. It won't work. I'm sure of it. And they don't know it yet. But they'll find out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A couple of stories to go with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Back in the late 90s when we were working on a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, we were generating a lot of new routines for developers to call. We had packages of routines called suites, and as we were generating them we didn't know which package an individual routine would go in when the new version was finalized. So we created a temporary package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+toys&quot;&gt;toys&lt;/a&gt;, disclaimed it would be deprecated before we shipped. We gave it a silly name so people would remember it was doomed. I said to devs, don't depend on anything in toys being there after we ship. Well, as promised, when it came time to ship, we sorted all the routines in toys to their permanent homes and deleted toys. Everything broke. Everything. The outcry was so loud and angry that we put toys back. The lesson is this, when you ship something to developers you're stuck with it, so be sure you can live with it when you ship. You have to live with your mistakes too. Clearly the Node developers think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; is a mistake. Well tough shit, you have to live with it. Sorry I didn't make the rules. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dave Gandy's company makes a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. It's great. When it came out I knew I was going to use it. I had even been asking someone to do what it does. Anyway, when they came out with a new version, they broke lots of stuff. The conventional wisdom was if the new version is a &quot;full point release,&quot; like you're going from version 4 to 5, you can break whatever you want. Well it was a huge setback for Font Awesome and it got users (like me) to fear upgrading to new versions. If they want to improve their product, Dave and his company learned, they would have to add functionality, they can never take functionality out. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/16.html#a180941&quot;&gt;wrote it up&lt;/a&gt; in February of this year, which feels like a decade ago! :-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At UserLand we came up with the fundamental rule, so fundamental that we called it Rule 1. It was this: Don't break users. There's nothing more sacred in the relationship between platform vendors and the devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So with all that background, I wonder what the Node platform vendor thinks we should use in place of request? To make it as smooth as possible it should just &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; request, of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Forester&quot;&gt;Subaru Forester&lt;/a&gt;. Nice car. But every so often the rear door refuses to open. Three beeps.

So confusing, they talk about buttons my car doesn't seem to have. Anyway it turns out if you hold the touch point for six seconds it'll open the rear door. Software glitch of some kind. From then on it works as normal. Wonder what the logic is. If it has the means to reset itself why doesn't it just reset itself without me having to jump through hoops?</description>

			<description>On Maddow last night an interesting observation as to why meat packing plants are even worse than we thought. Recall that enclosed spaces with lots of humans present for long periods of time are bad. The virus has plenty of time to become dense, which it needs to be infectious. But meat packing plants are also loud, lots of machinery, so people have to yell to be heard. And when an infected person yells they emit more virus, contributing to greater density, therefore more transmission.</description>

			<title>Virus in summertime?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+matt+ocko&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Matt Ocko&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattocko/status/1263795877103071233&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it's hot in Brazil and they have a lot of virus there, so the virus must do okay in heat, so therefore no reprieve during the summer in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether the virus does better or worse in summer months, but saying it's doing fine in Brazil doesn't add much data about how it will do in the US in the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the virus doesn't care about the heat, but humans behave differently when it's warm. We spend more time outdoors, and the virus isn't as infectious outdoors, because it's the virus &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1263787622859771904&quot;&gt;load&lt;/a&gt; that determines how infectious it is. At least that's what we currently think.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Human bodies are generally in better shape in the summer. That might make us better able to fight the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Brazil is a different place from the US and is responding socially to the virus differently, so it's hard to conclude anything about what happens in the US based on what happens in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course the US is a very varied country, so what happens in NYC is different from what happens in Calif, is different from other parts of New York State for that matter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't see the point of a presidential campaign. There's no way it can rise above our focus on the virus.

It's about the big moments in our life when change is more than something we dream about. It seems this is a door that's opening for all of us now, so why not post it publicly.

			<description>Gatekeepers pass on ideas from people they respect and not people they don't. It's natural. I do it too. But I've been wrong a number of times this way, and then missed out on important ideas. So I try to pay attention to unusual thinking whether or not I like the person doing the talking. It can be hard to overcome judgement, but it's often worth trying.</description>

			<title>State of the virus</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's where we're at with the virus in mid-May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Top line: It makes no sense to &quot;reopen&quot; from the lockdown in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the lockdown was to freeze everything so we could get our act together. To monitor outbreaks of the virus the same way we track the weather. It's not the testing itself that's so important, it's the weather report. There are other methods, like sampling the sewage a community creates. We have to know where the trouble spots are so we can respond. It's like the map of battlefields in a war. We can't respond if we don't know where the outbreaks are, and right now, we don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once an outbreak happens we lock that community down, the same way people would shelter if there were tornoados forecast or a blizzard, or fires like the ones they have in California and Australia. How long do they stay locked down? Until the outbreak is over. People need to be ready for this and that's accomplished through communication and trust. In the US our leaders are not trustworthy and they are removing channels of communication.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to isolate people who are infected. Sending them back to their family just means the family members are likely to get infected, feeding the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the US, none of this is working. We can't track outbreaks, there is no weather report. We can't isolate people who are infected. We're still at the beginning, more or less where we were in March, though the virus is distributed all around the country now. Most people don't know how dangerous the virus is. The communication field is flooded with lies from the government. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're going to have to hit the wall repeatedly until the people understand how this works. Countries in Asia had an advantage, they had to deal with recent pandemics that never made it to the US, presumably because our health systems and political leaders kept us safe without us being aware. We can't seem to learn from their experience, we will have to go through it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're reopening because we don't know better. Our government included. There will be new spikes, more sickness, suffering, incapacity, death. The economy will go into a deeper recession, which will be harder to recover from. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was talking with an old software developer friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22don+park%22&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Don Park&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. First project we did together was in 1988. He did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/15.html#a141614&quot;&gt;Mac INIT&lt;/a&gt; that enabled interprocess communication. It was part of the foundation we built &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on. We got around to JavaScript and he said I should make packages anyone can use. I said Don I do! No one knows about them, he said. Yeah, but I tell them. Heh. Maybe I should be doing PR. Finding the bloggers who are most influential about new packages that make JavaScript developers lives' easier and more interesting. Anyway, to start, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1262801291597791235&quot;&gt;sent&lt;/a&gt; Don a pointer to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread&quot;&gt;davefeedread package&lt;/a&gt;. It's a Node package that makes it &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt; and fast to read a feed. Any flavor of RSS or Atom. GIve it a URL and it calls back with a JavaScript object for the whole feed. Includes a simple example, sort of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedRead/blob/master/examples/readurl/read.js&quot;&gt;Hello World of feed reading&lt;/a&gt;. What you do from there is up to your imagination. It's the easiest way to read a feed in Node. A good place to start. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

To get infected there has to be a high density of virus and you have to be there for a relatively long time. Distance isn't the only important thing. I've been reading this between the lines of what experts talk and write about. I checked it out with my biomedical researcher friend. He says yes, it's the area under the curve that determines the infection rate.</description>

			<title>JavaScript is getting away from worse-is-better</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been programming almost exclusively in JavaScript since 2013. I’ve mastered callbacks, have no use for promises and most of the other fancy new stuff. I believe in minimal languages. The bloat in JavaScript is undermining what was attractive about it, it was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/chinesehouseholdrevisited.html#5&quot;&gt;consensus platform&lt;/a&gt;. Having a common syntax for programming cuts costs, makes it easier and therefore more likely to share ideas, and avoid the setbacks that come from reinventing the wheel. Now it's splitting up into a lot of different syntaxes. We're getting close to where we were before everything coalesced around JavaScript. It takes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;worse-is-better&lt;/a&gt; language to be the consensus. As a messy hairball that means different things to different people, it doesn't serve much of a purpose at all. However, I am invested, and am sticking with the core syntax I use, maybe others will do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Viruses in both worlds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Viruses on computers and viruses in the real world are interesting to compare. Right now I don't know if my computer, a Mac, has a virus, but there are no obvious symptoms of it being infected. That does  not mean it's not infected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When there's a virus going around, it screws up everything. Back in the 00s when viruses were running wild on Windows machines, I was a Windows user. Over time you learned how to defend against them. For example, when they offer you an ad-free version of an app, you say no. That was just the beginning. We were always trying to keep our computers virus-free, but eventually the viruses would figure out a way around our defenses, and we'd be spending all our time fighting it, until we got our machine uninfected, or at least without symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, the way we're dealing with the new coronavirus is the way computer newbies deal with computer viruses. I know because I have supported a virus neophyte, my mom. The current US govt is behaving pretty much the way she would. She didn't want to learn the rules, and she wanted to pretend it was okay, get back to business as usual (checking her email, writing a blog post). All the while she's got something watching and recording her every move and looking for a chance to infect some other computer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Programming milestone</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just got something neat working, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; integrated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foreversd/forever#readme&quot;&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt;. So now I can create a sub-folder of the domains folder, and put a Node app in it. PagePark will see it when it boots, and launch the app with Forever, running as a package, with no UI. PagePark tells it what port to run on via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-process-env-PORT-in-Node-js&quot;&gt;process.env.PORT&lt;/a&gt;, which is a standard. That's how PagePark, which is foremost an HTTP server, knows how to route requests to the app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always suspected this is where Forever belongs, but it took a few iterations over a couple of years to get to this place. The pieces all snap in place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further, I did it on a server without Dropbox running on it. The Linux version of Dropbox appears to be an unmaintained mess. It feels so much more solid not depending on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>An observation about servers on Node.js. Node is optimized for servers that handle millions of requests an hour -- to run services like Google and Facebook. Billions of users. But Node is most often used by services with far fewer users. Tradeoffs are everything in software. There should be popular server software, based on JavaScript, that creates more reliable, debuggable, easier to write servers, for the loads most people really have.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spoke for an hour yesterday with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nakedjen.com/&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; in Salt Lake City. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic there is very different from how it is where I live. Even though I moved to the country, I still live very much in the influence of NYC, which has suffered greatly. Massachusetts is less than an hour away by car, has been hit hard too. But in the mountain west, where Jen lives, a Republican territory, they &lt;i&gt;aren't&lt;/i&gt; hunkered down like we are. Jen and her family of course are. They're smart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My conclusion has been this: we're going to have to hit the wall a couple more times before everyone understands how frightfully scary and unknown this virus is. It would help if the US government were leading, but that wouldn't be enough. People who were terrified by 9/11 certainly have the capacity to understand the danger of the virus, they just haven't seen it yet. They will, I'm sure of it, because there's no other way out of the conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think everyone should read three bits of writing before they risk their lives or those of others before trying to resume their former lives. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/opinion/coronavirus-young-people.html&quot;&gt;Mara Gay's first person account&lt;/a&gt; of getting and &quot;surviving&quot; the virus in the NYT. She's young, fit, got the disease in mid-April, and it's destroyed her health. That's not too strong a word based on her account. People may not know this isn't binary, you don't just live or die. Some people survive and have lingering incapacity. How long does it last? &lt;i&gt;No one knows. &lt;/i&gt;We are exploring uncharted territory in the US because other countries halted the pandemic before they got to the stage we're at. I hope she fully recovers. I'm worried that she won't. She tells a powerful story. Uses her position on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/opinion/editorialboard.html&quot;&gt;Editorial Board&lt;/a&gt; of the Times in a noble way, in a blogger's way, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of bloggers, you should also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zeldman.com/2020/05/16/its-a-good-day/&quot;&gt;Zeldman's account&lt;/a&gt; of getting Covid-19 in mid-February and still is incapacitated. His daughter has it too. He's going through the same thing, though he's considerably older than Gay. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A random thought. We're hearing about younger people, some very young, who are having horrific experiences. Why aren't we hearing these stories from older people? Possibly the older people don't survive to become incapacitated. Maybe Covid-19 is long-term a young person's disease after all. Remember it isn't binary. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more must-read piece -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/amid-the-coronavirus-crisis-a-regimen-for-reentry&quot;&gt;Atul Gawande's checklist&lt;/a&gt; of how medical personnel in Boston are avoiding getting the infection. It's not any one thing, they do it by carefully incorporating the techniques the CDC recommended before they were silenced by the US government, the ones followed by the winners, South Korea, Taiwan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/02/145311.html?title=coronavirusInVietnam&quot;&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, China. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All three pieces fall strongly into the category of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt; journalism. Rather than inciting fear, Gawande shows us how to calmly and systematically increase our odds of not getting the disease. If I could make reading these pieces a requirement to continue reading my blog, I would. I want the smartest readers. Being smart is an investment, you learn what others are learning and think and do what you have to to protect yourself and others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Stay safe and wash your hands! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Rather than inciting fear, Gawande shows us how to calmly and systematically increase our odds of not getting the disease. If I could make reading these pieces a requirement to continue reading my blog, I would. I want the smartest readers.

			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/17/cuomoPodcastImage.png&quot;&gt;new graphic&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo Briefing Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I thought about putting some text on it, but decided a simple color picture of the governor was sufficient. If people want to give it a try, send me your version. I'm totally open to improvements. BTW &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/04/cuomoBriefing.png&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the original version.</description>

			<description>I've heard it said that the lockdown in NYC hasn't been very complete, but look at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/16/timesSquare.png&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of a Times Square &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKjNfj3ZVXw&quot;&gt;webcam&lt;/a&gt; at 1:40PM on a sunny warm Saturday in May. First question I'd ask is how did they do it?</description>
