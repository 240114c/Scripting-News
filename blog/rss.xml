			<description>In 1996, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;wrote a story&lt;/a&gt; for Upside, a dream really. I dreamt I was the CEO of Apple. Before Steve came back. I would buy a song, and make a new computer and drop the rest, and focus on getting developers to ship new products. Not all that different from what Steve did when he came back, except the part about developers. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Yesterday when I posted the instructions for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/06/153015.html?title=sharingOnFacebook&quot;&gt;how to share&lt;/a&gt; one of my blog posts to Facebook, in addition to trying to help a friend, I wanted to see for myself what the instructions would look like, in writing, without too much detail and without any steps omitted. The moral of the story is this. Come on Facebook, re-join the open web. Let's make it easy for people to do their writing outside Facebook for sharing inside. Let's make the wall of your silo so permeable that it ceases to be a silo. On Twitter I was asked why I keep beating this drum when it seems so unlikely that Facebook cares. I do it because I want to create a historic record, this has always been a big part of my blogging. I want to remember what sharing across silo walls was like in 2020. Maybe we'll look back and marvel that it was once this convoluted. Or maybe we'll marvel that it could be done at all. No one knows. But part of the reason I blog is to create a record. That's why I care so much about &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;bigco's&lt;/a&gt; trying to erase that record for selfish reasons.</description>

			<description>I appreciate the shout out yesterday from &lt;a href=&quot;https://evhead.com/autocompletely-5a29de03581b&quot;&gt;Evan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, a former competitor who has gone on to make billions as co-founder of Twitter. It's nice that he still reads my blog, even though I have said some critical things about Medium, but all in the spirit of trying to make the web work better. Hope they have been received that way. I learned from reading his post that he has moved to New York. I think that's a good move, from San Francisco, which as a born-and-bred NYer has always seemed really small to me. Of course I've now moved to a much much smaller place. Anyway Ev if you're reading this, thanks for the kind words. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A lot of people I knew years ago who have gone on to great success are keeping their distance. I wish they wouldn't. I have had my own experience with success, having been part of a tech IPO in the 80s, and creating a bunch of the tech in the 90s and 00s that we take for granted today. Some people may think I'm poor. I am not. The stock and real estate markets have made it pretty easy to build on a modest nest egg. But our humanity is so much more important than the ways we measure success and influence. Ultimately, no matter how rich any of us are, we don't really attain the influence we feel we deserve. I've learned that from burying two parents, both of whom had very strong opinions. Today, years after they are gone, well, no one really cares about what they thought. I care about them as my parents, the people who raised and cared for me, and I care about their struggles and accomplishments insofar as it was central to who they were. But their influence now is nil, and sadly, it was probably pretty close to that when they were alive. That's reality. So if we enjoyed each others' company before, if we learned from each other in the past, your great success shouldn't matter, it shouldn't be a barrier to more fun.</description>

			<title>Charley Hustle and the Hall of Fame</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/sports/basketball/nets-kyrie-irving-shoulder-injury-surgery.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss&quot;&gt;Kyrie Irving says&lt;/a&gt; he may need shoulder surgery. As you may know I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/26/172803.html&quot;&gt;not a huge fan&lt;/a&gt; of his. NY didn't need him. And it's obvious he didn't really want to play for the Nets or in NY, he wanted to play with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant&quot;&gt;KD&lt;/a&gt;. And until KD his healed, Kyrie would prefer to sit on the sideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reminds me that the other day I saw a comment about Pete Rose and how he belongs in the Hall of Fame, and I couldn't agree more. For so many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1213879234185302017&quot;&gt;Statistically&lt;/a&gt; it's a no-brainer. He has more hits, more singles, more at-bats, more games played, more outs than any other player in MLB history. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt; before there was Moneyball. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/11/whitey-ford-gave-pete-rose-his-charlie-hustle-nickname/&quot;&gt;Charlie Hustle&lt;/a&gt;. Who else would dive &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/07/charlieHustle.png&quot;&gt;head-first&lt;/a&gt; into second with no helmet? Is he even wearing gloves? Hard to tell. He should be in the Hall of Fame for this alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Charley Hustle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I said all that. And Alan Cooper who I know to otherwise be a reasonable person, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MrAlanCooper/status/1213879931416936449&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; if I would pardon Jeffrey Epstein (enslaver and sexual violator of children) or Nixon (defiler of the Constitution) because I would forgive Pete Rose for betting on his own team. I responded to Cooper that there is an obvious difference between Pete Rose and the others, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1213926736641044485&quot;&gt;sports&lt;/a&gt;. In sports we get to be judgmental assholes. You may hate Pete Rose, I love him. I loved him as a kid, because he taught me what passion was. It makes total sense to me that a man like that, too old to play the game himself, would indulge in gambling on the game, even when it was against the rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are too intolerant of different points of view on social networks. But I refuse to give up the last bastion of intolerant assholery and political incorrectness -- sports. So I'll keep on loving Pete Rose and you can keep hating him, and life goes on. No one is the worse for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- in tech, where both Alan and I come from, we bet on our own teams all the time. It's the norm. We give people the means to bet themselves, hoping it'll motivate them. Even in sports there are performance incentives. Players are given bonuses if they achieve a specific stat, or their team makes the playoffs. I could see being pissed if a manager bet &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; their team, but betting in favor the team? I don't know, but I just don't see the problem. In any case, he's going to be in the HoF when he's dead. Let him enjoy the acceptance and love now. Inside that old body is Charlie Hustle, let him in, if not for him, for the kids he inspired.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Even in sports there are performance incentives. Players are given bonuses if they achieve a specific stat, or their team makes the playoffs. I could see being pissed if a manager bet &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; their team, but betting in favor the team? I don't know, but I just don't see the problem. In any case, he's going to be in the HoF when he's dead. Let him enjoy the acceptance and love now. Inside that old body is Charlie Hustle, let him in, if not for him, for the kids he inspired." created="Tue, 07 Jan 2020 16:03:04 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/01/07/155714.html?title=charleyHustleAndTheHallOfFame#a160304"/>

			<description>The thing that was so frustrating about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/amp/article/156096/death-good-internet-inside-job-decade-hell&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; from Jason Linkins in the New Republic is that he is the kind of user we need on the open web. They see it as we deserted them, but as a developer who needs smart driven creative and friendly users, when you guys left, and decided to pour your brilliance into Twitter and Facebook instead, you helped drive the downward spiral. &lt;i&gt;Users matter. &lt;/i&gt;That's the thing I've never been able to communicate to users. Stop being sheep. Choose. It may be a little harder, you may have to give up some features at first, but if you support a creative individual developer, you could be amazed at the new power they can and will create for you. Work with developers who make tools you like. Help them.</description>

			<description>Sometimes on FB people say the kind of stuff you hear on CNN from opinioneers whose job it is to say something even when there isn't anything to say. You listen to these people, and it's just a word salad of non-sentences that have absolutely no meaning. Then the host that you somewhat admire (e.g. Tapper, Melber) says that's an excellent point, Pete or that gets you thinking Gloria, and you realize they're just filling time with words that really have no meaning, and you're just wasting your time, you could learn more watching a Law &amp; Order rerun for the 18th time. At least they're getting paid to do it. But on FB, there's just no call for it.</description>

			<title>Sharing on Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/howardweaver&quot;&gt;Howard Weaver&lt;/a&gt; asked how to share a post from Scripting News to Facebook. These days this is how I do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in its own browser window. This makes it easier to go back and forth, which we're going to have to do several times. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on the purple pound sign to the right of the post you want to share. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Take a screen shot of the post. Here's how I do it on the Mac. Press Cmd-Shift-4, to go into Screen Shot mode. You can let up the keys after pressing them. Move the mouse to the upper left corner of the area you want to copy, click and hold, then drag to the lower right corner and let up the mouse. The screen shot is now on the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open Facebook in another window. Navigate to the place you want to drop the shared post. Click in the text box, and press Cmd-V (on the Mac) to paste the screen shot. Do not submit the post yet, there's more to do.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Go back to the browser window with the Scripting News post, click in the address bar. Cmd-A if necessary to select the whole address and copy it to the clipboard (Cmd-C). Switch back into Facebook and paste the address into the message. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One more time, go back to the post and select a provocative phrase or sentence from the post. Something that'll catch the readers' interest. Select, Copy, switch into Facebook, Paste. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now you're ready to post. Review what's there to make sure everything is as you'd like it and then click the Post button. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Of course I shared this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1128171360723601&amp;set=a.113966572144090&amp;type=3&amp;theater&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Iran has the kind of opportunity the US had after 9/11. We had the whole world behind us. Had we shown restraint, we could have cemented our &quot;sole superpower&quot; status. Instead of spending trillions on unwinnable wars, we could have put that money into infrastructure. Rebuilt our school system. By now those kids would be in the workforce, kicking ass competitively. We would be solving problems. Amazingly Iran is in a similar place now. The US is the bad guy, the terrorist, with an unprovoked attack of apparently similar scale as the terrorist attacks of 9/11. In addition to helping Iran, it would help the people of the United States to get our country off the insane path it's on. By not responding, you deprive Trump of an enemy, and win the support of the world, including in the US. This is how the world wins.</description>

			<title>Email congestion</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night's emails didn't go out because I exceeded the rate limit with the service provider we use. It's good that more people subscribed to the emails. I've sent the service provider a request to increase the rate limit. Apologies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've also added code to my nightly mail-sending app to limit the rate at which we send emails. Previously we sent them out the pipe as fast as we can. Since computers these days are very fast, that's a lot of emails in a very short time.

			<title>When we talk about Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/04/05/HailThis.html#2&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The press only knows three stories, Apple is dead, Microsoft is evil, and Java is the future.&quot; In 2020, Apple is alive, no one worries about Microsoft's character, and Java is no longer the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Facebook? According to journalism, Facebook is a bad place. Facebook is a place you don't want to go. Reality is as the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/yogi_berra_100418&quot;&gt;Yogi Berra&lt;/a&gt; said: &quot;No one goes there anymore, it's too crowded.&quot; That's Facebook. It isn't any one thing, it's everything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The scale of Facebook is hard to imagine. To say Facebook is like a low-life bar (something one of my correspondents on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/olivermarks/status/1213146774996541440&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;) would be like saying NYC is a low-life bar -- ridiculous -- NYC has 8.6 million people. It has art museums, libraries, great restaurants, office buildings, millions of homes and families to go with them. Two baseball stadiums. Two airports. Dozens of schools and universities. It's a big place but Facebook is much much much bigger. Let's say Facebook has a billion users. That means it's 125 times the size of NYC. The people who go to Facebook are not low-lifers, they're your friends and family, colleagues, classmates, people in power, retired people, rich and poor, from every continent. What is happening on Facebook? Does anyone have the slightest idea? Even the Facebook company probably only has a very aggregated view of what goes on there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a hunch that Facebook is where journalism is rebooting. I know we're supposed to scoff at the idea of people doing it for themselves, helping each other get the info they need, but if there's going to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjr.org/local_news/american-news-deserts-donuts-local.php&quot;&gt;local news desert&lt;/a&gt;, something has to fill the gap. Just because professional journalism is leaving localities (which includes non-geographic locales like industries and professions), does that mean we must live without journalism? I think not. We need journalism, and we'll have it, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Professional journalism does not respect online. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/social-media-2020.html&quot;&gt;Farhad Manjoo's latest&lt;/a&gt;. What a trip. Some of my friends in Woodstock don't use Facebook for the reasons he outlines. Why? Because they heard it from him, or another NYT reporter or columnist, and believed it. My friends didn't find this out themselves, because if they looked, asked for pointers from friends (for example me), they would have found their people there. If they hang out with evil people, that's probably what they'd find. Or if they live with aging hippies (as in the place I live now) then that's what they'd find. Billions of people can't all be as bad and stupid as a columnist in the NYT says they are. And remember that Manjoo has reasons to want you not to like Facebook. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something&quot;&gt;salary&lt;/a&gt; depends on it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I can now add an image to a post that is not in the right margin, it's centered on the page, above the text that serves as its caption. This is an example of such a post. Then I added a nice border, and padding, and made the text a bit smaller to be more like a caption. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism has some people believing that there's nothing good about online. That they should stay away from Facebook. It's not safe. But it's where people go now. Billions. I'm not happy about that, but it is what it is. Saying online is dangerous is like saying the subway is dangerous. But if you live in New York, you probably want to take the subway. Driving is dangerous. Everything is. Life itself isn't safe. It's a mix. You have to learn to discern. But most people are good, and most people are on Facebook. And it pisses me off that a few of my neighbors won't use Facebook, and when I ask why, they repeat the talking points of the journalists, almost verbatim. We perceive the world of today as being more dangerous than the world we grew up in. In fact, today's world is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/14/theres-never-been-a-safer-time-to-be-a-kid-in-america/?noredirect=on&quot;&gt;much safer&lt;/a&gt;. Perceptions that come from listening to journalism too much. It seems, knowing this, it would be responsible to temper their promotion of fear. It creates an obstacle we have to overcome. But they keep at it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/social-media-2020.html&quot;&gt;Stay away little person&lt;/a&gt;. Online is dangerous. Better to stay safe.</description>

			<description>If the NYT covered NYC as they cover FB they would never run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/sports/carmelo-anthony-knicks-trailblazers.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; like this about the Knicks. What they fail to convey in their reporting, probably because they don't feel it, is that FB is much larger than NYC. And as diverse and interesting.</description>

			<description>Speaking of Facebook, yesterday I posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1123011587906245&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; intended to be wistful and introspective that some people took as a cry for help. Funny how that works. I said this: &quot;Honestly I never thought I’d make it to 2020.&quot; Now it's 100 percent my fault there was confusion. Going back to the 1960s, when we had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_cover&quot;&gt;duck and cover drills&lt;/a&gt; in school, we all thought for sure we'd die in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust&quot;&gt;nuclear holocaust&lt;/a&gt; long before 2020. If you had asked me then what were the chances I'd be alive in 2020, I probably would have said &quot;No one will be alive in 2020.&quot; But here we are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Soon we'll be able to write the epitaph of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; as a basketball player. If I were to write it today it'd go like this. Melo is not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;LeBron&lt;/a&gt; and he's not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Smith&quot;&gt;JR Smith&lt;/a&gt;. LeBron is a general, a warrior. JR Smith is a joker, prankster, doper, partier. All three can shoot like nobody's business. Melo is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever&quot;&gt;Black Lab&lt;/a&gt;. He's a pet. He should have been teamed up with LeBron or someone like him. He'd make a great #2. But he was miscast as the hero of the Knicks, so the Melo Knicks were losers. But because he's so sweet and he has a great shot, New York loves Melo.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;This cartoon comes closest to describing the dismay of people who did not vote for Trump about people who did. No matter what you may believe, how could crashing the country possibly be better than trying to work together? I'm not talking about parties working together, or news networks, I'm talking about people, American-to-American.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
