			<title>Too many remotes, still</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This started out being a review of the new Apple TV but the real story is same as it ever was, the living room networking situation is still a mess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/20/tooManyRemotes.png&quot;&gt;too many remotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This tale started when the Spectrum app for Roku broke, I could no longer access my favorites. That meant every time I wanted to find a program, I had to fish through all the channels. I've learned over the years which channels I need, basically MSNBC, CNN, HBO, Showtime, the stations that have Law &amp; Order, channels that carry the sports teams I follow. I imagine it's pretty similar for other people. After all these years you develop paths, and program the system accordingly. At this point, I'm not willing to use Spectrum without favorites. But I have been, and it's unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their support is also ridiculous. They want you to jump through the same set of hoops every time no matter what the problem is. I do what they ask, even though I have a theory about what happened. I'm pretty sure they broke something in an upgrade. I can tell I'm using a new version, they made little UI changes, at the same time Favorites stopped working. That's an Occam's Razor type thing. More evidence -- my Favorites are still there on my iPhone, iPad and in the new Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to why I was interested in Apple TV in the first place. I thought perhaps I could just use Apple TV to access Spectrum, working around the breakage. $199 is a lot of money to spend to do that, but I had an extra HDMI port open on my TV, and I wanted to see what's new there, so why not. I had an old Apple TV, btw -- but the Spectrum app wasn't available for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I've spent a few days with Apple TV, trying to fit it into my routine. But it's not a good fit for mostly UI reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to use their remote. The Roku remote, which to me is the most natural, doesn't work with Apple TV. The Apple remote is innovative. Now I see why they were making a big deal about track pads. But it's slow and error-prone, compared to clicking the arrows on the Roku remote. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But there's the problem now of having two remotes. One of my rules for design is &quot;One way is better than two, no matter how much better the second is.&quot; I bet Apple can prove that their remote is better. But on Rokui I think they should just use the Roku remote. I remember when I first shipped Mac software in 1984, I wanted to design my own (better) user interface. After a year or so we gave up on that and just used the Mac standard interface, even though it wasn't good for what we were doing. The pressure not to make people master a second UI was too great. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And there's a third way -- the Mac mouse and keyboard to control Mac Mini, that I've had hooked into my living room TV for 15 years or so. In the old days it was very useful. These days, I prefer to use the streaming services. I use the Mac for demos, and to show videos of my own, though I could use the Apple TV for that. Honestly I don't know why I have a Mac under my TV these days, but I do.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The net-net is that the Apple TV will not get a lot of use. It doesn't have anything over Roku, and they make me put down the Roku remote and pick up theirs. The Apple remote is weird, it doesn't work the way I feel it should. I'm sure they think I'm wrong, but I remember that I'm the customer, and there's an adage that goes with that too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dropbox not working (for me)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the time Dropbox works, but today, sometime just after 11AM Eastern, it got flaky and basically stopped working. Usually it's something I did, so I started checking things out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have two accounts, neither is close to out of space. One is using 178.85 GB of 2.1 TB. The other is using 11.68 GB of 2 TB.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I thought perhaps my desktop computer wasn't synching. I tried creating a folder, and it took a very long time for it to show up in the dropbox.com file browser, but it did eventually show up. But it does not show up on the server it's intended for.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My desktop computer says it's been synching for a couple of hours. That's when I started looking. Maybe it was going on a lot longer. I don't know. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The way I first experienced the outage is that updates to the app I'm working on stopped appearing on the server. Before that I was making changes, and they'd take the usual amount of time, a few seconds, to appear on the server.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I checked their &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;, and it says everything is good. I looked at the Dropbox support &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DropboxSupport&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, it says it's closed until Monday.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm kind of stuck. No idea what the problem is. Is it my problem? How can I tell. It doesn't seem like it, because if it were, all my desktop computers and servers would have to be experiencing the same problem. It could happen. But it doesn't seem likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Git-based code sync</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/145319.html&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; about using git for code distribution. This was a new idea for me. In the past I've done it lots of different ways.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/about.html&quot;&gt;Fat pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS feeds, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+codecasting&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;aka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/02/16/whatIsCodecasting.html&quot;&gt;codecasting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One-way sync with an S3 location.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They all work well and scale since they're static. I did one method that wasn't static, using XML-RPC. That method had problems as the installed base of Frontier grew. Static distribution is the way to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I waited for a response to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/145319.html&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; about folder-level sync with a git repository, I went ahead with the brute force method, which works as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When it's time to sync, first we clone the whole repo into a temp folder. Then compare the destination folder with the sub-folder of the downloaded repo, copy the new or changed files. Then delete the temporary repo.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The assumption is that the repo is relatively small. We burn a bit of bandwidth and temporary disk space. And the job gets done. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The overall system I'm working on will also support one-way sync with an S3 location and perhaps RSS-based delivery later. But right now having git-based distribution working, I can proceed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Breaking Bad finale</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As with previous installments, this contains spoilers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched the last two episodes of Breaking Bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I had only watched them once, when they first came out, but I remembered almost all of it. And it's amazing that so much happens in the last episode.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First I want to say that my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/171521.html&quot;&gt;previous report&lt;/a&gt; is one of the sloppiest bits of writing and editing I've ever done. It's practically incoherent. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point was this, even though I hate Walter White, his humanity comes through, and his broken heart. Even more so in the finale. No one wants his money. His son wants him to die. He admits now he wasn't doing it for his family, he was doing it because he's good at making meth and being a crime boss, and he likes it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the end he forgives Jesse. And he spends his last moments in Jesse's meth lab, and he's happy in the only way Walter White, having passed on the family business, ever was happy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Was it a great show? Yes. No reservations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got started on this exploration by watching the Breaking Bad movie that just came out. I was wondering if there was anything they could have done with two hours that would be respectful of the show. I haven't figured that out. I'll let you know if I do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Would Brooks vote for Warren?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I always wonder why people disclaim that they don't like me before they point to something I've written as being relevant or important. So I won't tell you what I think of David Brooks. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/trump-warren-2020.html&quot;&gt;His column&lt;/a&gt; in today's NYT is worth reading. He asks if it's Trump v Warren, who he, a moderate Republican, will vote for. I'll save you the suspense, it's Warren. Good, Brooks has a soul and isn't an idiot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Four years of Warren, who imho likely will be as ineffective a president as Jimmy Carter, is way better than four years of the accelerated lunacy of Trump. The United States, seriously, would not survive that. I don't think we'll survive another 1.5 years, which is why impeachment and removal is an urgent matter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He says &quot;If the party nominated one of those six, you really could see the Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence. You could see movement on a range of issues where large majorities are already stacked on one side: guns, climate change, reducing income inequality, expanding health coverage.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I agree. A lot of change would be possible with a centrist Democrat in the presidency, they might even be possible with Warren. I like the progressive ideas, and I think our chance of progress is better if we elect a moderate in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_goes_to_China&quot;&gt;Nixon going to China&lt;/a&gt;, something worth considering, a moderate Democrat could be more effectively progressive than Warren. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;As with previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/16/192128.html&quot;&gt;installments&lt;/a&gt;, this contains spoilers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/breaking-bad-5-shocking-quotes-629629&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias_(Breaking_Bad)&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; where Hank dies. A very pivotal scene. Walt loses his money to the Nazis, of course Hank dies as does his friend Gomez. Walter White comes unglued. All logic says, based on previous Walter White choices, that Hank must die. The Nazi, Jack, knows it, Hank knows it. Hank, after hearing Walter offer the Jack $80 million to let Hank live, must have been touched, because his final words were: &quot;You want me to beg? You're the smartest guy I ever met, and you're too stupid to see -- he made up his mind 10 minutes ago.&quot; It's a beautiful scene. And of course none of the events taking place wouldn't have happened if Walter weren't so blinded by his obsession with money, and his feelings about Jesse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still hate Walter White, I guess I never doubted the depth of his character, he has a heart, and it's breaking now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a project using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steveukx/git-js#readme&quot;&gt;simple-git&lt;/a&gt; in Node, and have what I think should be a simple application, not sure how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a local called myAppFolder containing the source for an application. Various JavaScript files, a package.json, folders for user data and stats. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A location on GitHub, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/test2&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; called test2 with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/test2/tree/master/helloworld&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; whose path is helloworld/ that is meant to have the most up to date version of the files from the location on GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a one-way sync, from the server to the local folder. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/397be0cf030bc3709eb73f3deb6f5912&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; that clones the repo, but that gets a copy of everything in the repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just need to keep up to date with one folder. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Any help much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I opened this as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/issues/403&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; on the simple-get repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In 1995 I wrote a piece entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#3&quot;&gt;The Baseball God&lt;/a&gt;. It was about two days. 1. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_World_Series#Game_5&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; the Mets won the World Series in 1969. 2. And the day of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake&quot;&gt;Loma Prieta quake&lt;/a&gt;, when the Giants were playing the A's in the World Series in San Francisco. I only realize now, 24 years later, that they were just one day apart, October 17 in 1989, and October 16 in 1969 (I'm writing this on October 17, 2019). Is the Baseball God sending us a message?</description>

There's now a &lt;i&gt;More&lt;/i&gt; button at the bottom of the page, if you click it, you'll get another page from the Scripting News archive, going back as far as May 2017, when the current CMS came online. You can also vertically scroll past the end and it'll do it without you having to click the button. It's a little tricky because there's so much text at the bottom.</description>

Soaking in the hot tub, I would say to the nearby tree &quot;I own you.&quot; It just laughs. If the tree could speak it would say: &quot;I was here long before you, and I'll be here when you're gone.&quot; It's true, I sold the house in 2003. The house has been torn down, but the live oak trees are still there. That's the web. It's deep and broad. Try to break it, you might as well try to boil the ocean.</description>

			<description>I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/25.html#a135230&quot;&gt;bike accident&lt;/a&gt; a little over 3 weeks ago. Broke a rib, am &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGlo9LzmOME&quot;&gt;getting&lt;/a&gt; over it. It takes a long time for a rib to heal. This is the second time I've had the rib-breaking kind of bike accident. Last time I broke multiple ribs on both sides. This time it was only one rib but it really broke. I thought for a while I'd have to get surgery to repair it, but it's fixing itself. Makes breathing hard and sleep comes in spurts, I haven't slept through the night since it happened.</description>

			<description>Here's a radical idea. How about a Democratic presidential candidate who runs as a conservative. That would blow a lot of minds imho. Here's the deal. Restore the American Revolution and the Constitution. Fix bugs in Obamacare, prepare for a national debate on further healthcare reform, to be discussed without a gun to our heads. Repeal the tax cuts passed by Republicans, they were an obvious corrupt act. Have to do something to punish the Repubs for Merrick Garland. Create a new foundation for respectful discourse in America. It's time for some honor and self-respect, America. You've been acting like a spoiled rich kid.</description>

			<title>Breaking Bad overview</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spoiler alert for everything. Sorry. I should really put this piece on &lt;a href=&quot;http://spoilers.io/&quot;&gt;spoilers.io&lt;/a&gt;, if it only existed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm on episode 8 of the final season of Breaking Bad, and I can now tell you why I cringe when people say it's the best TV show ever. I couldn't have said exactly why before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like all kinds of crime stories. I like Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction. The Godfather is the best movie ever made. The Maltese Falcon. The Departed. I love them all, and they all have one thing in common. The lead character is sympathetic. Tony Soproano is the mob boss who is seeing a shrink and has a neurotic wife whose approval he desperately wants. He's sympathetic. Would Succession be as good if Logan Roy wasn't proud of his son for being so awful? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Breaking Bad? I absolutely hate Walter White. Every episode provides new reasons to hate him. That's the central idea of the show. How hateable can we make Walter White? I hate that so many sympathetic people die before he goes. Gus Fring was sympathetic. Mike Ehrmentraut. I forget all the characters who die (I'm going to re-discover them now). All his adversaries are sympathetic. But he's an absolute worst piece of shit he could possibly be &lt;i&gt;and the show is all about him. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing. I'm a huge fan of Bojack Horseman. And his sidekick, like Gilligan to the Skipper, like Sgt Schultz to Col Klink, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://bojackhorseman.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Chavez&quot;&gt;Todd Chavez&lt;/a&gt;. Who is played by Aaron Paul who plays Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad. And this time around, I hear Todd's voice when Jesse speaks. It's funny! Of course there's more overt satire in Bojack, even though I'm sure the Breaking Bad writers meant it to be funny in a hateful way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I admire Breaking Bad. I am in awe of it, everything about it. But I also hate it because I have to focus on a character who I thoroughly despise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I figured out why the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/12/122844.html&quot;&gt;Breaking Bad movie&lt;/a&gt; is so unsatisfying. I watched it, I liked it, but it didn't get me excited and interested like the series did. I decided to re-watch the last season to see what the difference was. There are many great things about the show. The use of music, the weird camera shots that are integrated with the plot. It's artistically ecelectic in so many ways. But it's also &lt;i&gt;slow. &lt;/i&gt;Things develop very very slowly. But there's no space in a 2-hour single-episode show to develop the puzzling intrigue of the series. No time to spread out, relax, take your time, go slow. So not much happens, and then it's over. It's not really Breaking Bad, it's a 2-hour movie with the characters of Breaking Bad. That was the same problem with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood:_The_Movie&quot;&gt;Deadwood movie&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing that could work is another 10-episode season, played out over 10 weeks.</description>

The only thing that could work is another 10-episode season, played out over 10 weeks." created="Mon, 14 Oct 2019 15:48:49 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/14/heisenberg.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/10/14.html#a154849"/>

			<description>And Succession. It had one of the all-time great season finales last night. No spoilers here, except to point to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9E1eBLqWc&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that HBO produced that summarizes the deliciousness of the end, do not watch it if you haven't seen the whole season. It really would spoil it.</description>

			<title>Customized searching</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been emailing with my old friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/IntroducingDaveCarlick.html&quot;&gt;Dave Carlick&lt;/a&gt; about customized searching. I've also been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/09/143957.html&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about it here. I'm not sure I've made my point, but now I have an excellent example that might shed some light. Dave, take note.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I just searched Google for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot; old+school&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It came back with pointers to a 2003 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_(film)&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;. A Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/OldSchoolMovie/&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old-school&quot;&gt;dictionary&lt;/a&gt; definition. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=old%20school&quot;&gt;urban dictionary&lt;/a&gt; version. And on and on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But I have a product named &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;. I've written about it on my blog a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+&quot; old+school&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;bunch&lt;/a&gt; of times. If Google knew I was the author of this blog, it would also know that when I search for Old School, I want to see my product first, because in all likelihood that's what I'm looking for. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what I mean about associating the searcher with the searcher's blog. Think of it as SEO for a person. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's another one. I just searched for Dave Carlick. Google asks if I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/14/didIMeanCarlock.png&quot;&gt;meant&lt;/a&gt; Dave Carlock. That's crazy. I've been friends with Dave Carlick for 30-plus years. If it read my blog it would know that. It's so wrong. In fact, if I type Carlock it should know I meant Carlick. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Google is so crazy that when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Dave+Carlick+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=Dave+Carlick+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l2.1191j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;restict the search&lt;/a&gt; to my site, it still asks if I meant Carlock, even though there are references to Carlick &lt;i&gt;on the site I'm searching&lt;/i&gt; going back to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/IntroducingDaveCarlick.html&quot;&gt;1990s&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Stories on GitHub</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I tried out an idea. It's a little Node app that runs on the same server as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; that builds this blog. Every minute it looks at today's posts, for those that have titles (like the post your'e reading now), it checks if it changed, and if so it renders it as Markdown and uploads it to GitHub in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/stories/&quot;&gt;calendar-based structure&lt;/a&gt;, along-side all the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;parts&lt;/a&gt; of the blog I maintain automatically on GitHub.  I like using GitHub this way, I have a feeling it'd make a good shared object database.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been hand-generating links to the GitHub version to get you all thinking about this idea, like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;As an experiment this story is archived &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/stories/2019/10/14/a130849.md&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did this based on an assumption that I would be able to figure out a way to make it possible for any of my posts to become a sub-project on GitHub. I'm not saying any of them &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; become projects, only now it would be possible. I thought this might work well with the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email distribution system&lt;/a&gt; which has stimulated so much discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how this is going to work, or if it will work, I'm just trying an idea out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Pro tip for podcasters. In your RSS feed, each &amp;lt;item&gt; should set the &amp;lt;link&gt; element to point at the landing page for the episode. Otherwise the only way to share your podcast is with a link to the MP3 which isn't good for you or them. You can see dozens of these items in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/podc/&quot;&gt;podc&lt;/a&gt; account on Twitter.</description>

			<description>A lot of other people, including Republicans, have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/warrens-same-sex-marriage-quip-captures-what-some-find-exciting--and-others-distressing--about-her/2019/10/11/f3e15a14-ec34-11e9-85c0-85a098e47b37_story.html?fbclid=IwAR0XG4_2Vt6Oi6JRsYbLTTwo2dQAy2HgtaGu_UN4UYzo4h-VbbJ7qfAxYmk&quot;&gt;picked up&lt;/a&gt; on Elizabeth Warren's unfortunate &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/12.html#a125744&quot;&gt;putdown&lt;/a&gt; of people who think that marriage is between one woman and one man. We have to have a serious talk about this, because it reveals a side of Warren that is divisive and unacceptable. I'm sick of electing presidents who divide us into evil and not-evil. It's &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; sickness of our country. Honestly I don't care about marriage, anyone's marriage. I think marriage is an awful institution. It wrecked the family I grew up in. So no one has the high ground here as far as I'm concerned. And while I think Warren is the best candidate we have now, I think she needs to do some soul searching on this. If she is elected, it would be tragic if she does the same kind of BS that the Republicans do, and tries to make some Americans outcasts. After all, the question she was asked was about other people's &lt;i&gt;beliefs, &lt;/i&gt;not their actions. And as president, her job would be to safeguard their rights, along with those of people she agrees with. As faculty at Harvard Law School I would think she would be steeped in that understanding, that it would run in her blood. The Constitution isn't just for people we agree with.</description>
