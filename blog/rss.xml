			<description>The reporting on Ukraine misses an important point. Not only was Trump putting the squeeze on Ukraine to become part of his mob, he was also selling them out. A small relatively powerless country that depended on our protection, Trump was stepping back and letting Russia roll over them.</description>

			<description>Michael Moore was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWiqycRVkvc&quot;&gt;guest on MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; last night. It was really refreshing. He provides the perspective of a person. He thinks Biden should be leading the fight against Trump. I agreed with everything he said. Clear thinking. Totally worth watching.</description>

			<description>WIth &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/07.html&quot;&gt;Big 25&lt;/a&gt; coming up, it's great to hear from people who were reading in the early years. For example, David Boroditsky checked in yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/boroditsky/status/1179081346943078400&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. He sent a link to an email he sent me, which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/stories/DavidBoroditsky.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; to the blog, in Oct 1996, two years after the start. He talks about the non-web features of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I forget that Frontier and the blog were two sides of the same coin in the early days. All the early blogging and RSS software ran in Frontier.</description>

			<description>Because Barr is in such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/2019/10/01/the-dangerous-position-of-william-barr/&quot;&gt;precarious position&lt;/a&gt;, and he's smart, he must have factored in the risk before going out on the limb. He's betting that he and Trump et al will be able to toss the Constitution in a trash can, and govern any way they want, without oversight and inconvenient co-equal branches of government. We're at much at risk as he is.</description>

			<description>Trump is breaking the Constitution. Openly, and it'll never be repaired if he isn't cancelled. We should have fought this &quot;civil war&quot; a long time ago, but all the time we delay the chances of our form of govt surviving goes down.</description>

			<description>In the almost-25 years of blogging on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, I did take a few weeks off here and there. In the 90s, mostly to take week-long massage classes, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Hot_Springs&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; where there was no internet access, which was  common back then, believe it or not.</description>
