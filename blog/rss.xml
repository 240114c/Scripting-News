			<description>From the necessity is the mother of invention department. I had never been able to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop&quot;&gt;AirDrop&lt;/a&gt; to work, but recently I became incentivized to figure it out. Now I'm using it for all kinds of things. In my experience it doesn't &quot;just work,&quot; but once you get it working, it's very useful.</description>

			<description>I just read a piece on Gizmodo saying that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/rss-is-better-than-twitter-1833624929&quot;&gt;RSS is better than Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Then I had a thought, why not turn Twitter into an RSS reader. It's not too many steps. Accept an OPML subscription list. When you add a feed, call &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: .95em&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and say &quot;map the output of this feed onto this Twitter account.&quot; When a feed disappears from the list, delete the IFTTT script. I'm not sure if IFTTT's API will let you do this. OTOH you could probably set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river5&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt; installation to do it, but it'd be more work. :-)</description>

			<title>Be a sponge</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In my career I can't tell you how many times people said they don't have to listen to me because I'm not relevant anymore. That always seems to end in failure, because there's no good reason not to seek out free advice, it can help you avoid pitfalls. If you fancy yourself an entrepreneur or an innovator you must absorb info and perspective like a sponge. Don't ever think you're so successful or smart that you might not be missing something huge. I was taught this early in my career as part of sales training.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>ThinkTank gets a Star Trek credit</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;From Ted Howard &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm reading a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Year-Mission-Generation-Uncensored-Unauthorized/dp/1250089468/ref=pd_aw_fbt_14_img_2/140-9161096-1268535?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1250089468&amp;pd_rd_r=2c8aaa31-5235-11e9-b8ff-1749bfa13380&amp;pd_rd_w=XOcD5&amp;pd_rd_wg=eSrPc&amp;pf_rd_p=3ecc74bd-d08f-44bd-96f3-d0c2b89f563a&amp;pf_rd_r=A9ERAK8M4BNT35C7JCVY&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=A9ERAK8M4BNT35C7JCVY&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about the history of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek&quot;&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;, and came upon an interesting tidbit I thought you would like.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gerrold&quot;&gt;David Gerrold&lt;/a&gt;, writer of the original series episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tribbles&quot;&gt;The Trouble with Tribbles&lt;/a&gt;, was also involved on the early days of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation&quot;&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He wrote the ‚Äúbible‚Äù for the series using &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.scripting.com/thinkTank2Pc.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt;. He printed the outline out to show &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roddenberry&quot;&gt;Gene Roddenberry&lt;/a&gt;, who was thrilled with how he had organized it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So, it looks like you contributed to Star Trek. That‚Äôs pretty cool.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My comment&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I love that story. Back in the 80s the Mac was very popular in Hollywood, and our product was one of the leading products, so we had a lot of famous people using it for projects like that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>TheC gets another look</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This time I hope the press who cover new media will ask serious questions instead of echoing the hype. I will write more about it myself, I assume. I've been working on my move to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/09.html#a181343&quot;&gt;the country&lt;/a&gt; for the last 24 hours so I've only had time to tweet about this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this post I'll link to the tweets and to the posts I wrote during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/&quot;&gt;maximum hype&lt;/a&gt; over The Correspondent. I didn't care where their office was. I did object to them claiming to be revolutionary, because I didn't see any evidence of that. I come from the tech industry which indulged in this kind of hype many many times, and fortunes were made, a lot more than $2.7 million, over less than what The Correspondent had. I had high hopes for them, and in the end when I saw the plan I saw that they either didn't understand, or they punted and decided to do something pretty normal, but to hype it as if it were remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are some of today's on-topic tweets&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1111138011570421762&quot;&gt;1:28AM&lt;/a&gt;: It wasn't a movement.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1111242012739756034&quot;&gt;8:21AM&lt;/a&gt;: I asked tough questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1111301796985737217&quot;&gt;12:19PM&lt;/a&gt;: It's not a PR disaster, it's worse.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1111305114726420482&quot;&gt;12:32PM&lt;/a&gt;: The baby squirrel pitch.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And some of the previous posts&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;December 10: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/10.html#a145856&quot;&gt;Another academic journalist endorsed TheC&lt;/a&gt;, plus comments on overhyped journalism startups. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;December 11: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/11/131151.html&quot;&gt;Followup on The Correspondent&lt;/a&gt;. I asked questions of the company and got some answers. Some of which may be news to pundits opining about TheC.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;December 12: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/12.html#a174702&quot;&gt;I emailed with Baratunde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;December 13: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/13.html#a130100&quot;&gt;I object to calling a for-profit venture a movement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;December 27: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/27.html&quot;&gt;What it means that TheC has to co-exist&lt;/a&gt; with the deep-pockets of Medium, which takes a much more courageous view of reader than TheC does (and imho if they don't match them, what chance do they have).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally just so you know where I'm coming from&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Last summer I wrote a piece entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;How journalism is like the Mets&lt;/a&gt;. Especially appropriate since today is opening day, and the Mets won, with hits by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/mets/robinson-cano-home-run-mets-first-at-bat-1.29079705&quot;&gt;former Yankee&lt;/a&gt; if you can believe that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Journalism has yet to win the World Series in the new world. The people who write about journalism today don't have a feel for what's possible. They're roaming around in the dark looking for inspiration, but they don't seem to know what questions to ask.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Correspondent was a softball. Easy to figure out. Yet they all took the easy way out and just repurposed the hype. I believe they believed it. But they have to toughen up if they want to make it to the championship series. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

According to the old rules, my conditions are not pre-existing. 3. In other words, I don't lose my insurance if Repubs kill ObamaCare. 4.

			<description>This is a really &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/school-segregation-new-york.html&quot;&gt;interesting piece&lt;/a&gt; that tells the story of school desegregation in NYC, which my family took part in, in the 1960s. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/26/eveAndPeterWalkingToSchoolIn1964.png&quot;&gt;mother and little brother&lt;/a&gt; were on the front page of the NYT on Sept 14, 1964, walking from our mostly white &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;, to the paired school in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens&quot;&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;, a black neighborhood. (She was wearing a scarf and looking into the camera.) The white parents and kids walked toward the black neighborhood, the black parents and kids, walked to the school in the white neighborhood.

			<description>A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17.html#a161227&quot;&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; that I have ideas for new architectures for feed reading. Here's the main idea. Users should be able to subscribe to OPML lists, not just import them. So I could use a different editor, or discovery mechanism, or who-knows-what to manage (some of) my subscription lists. Or use two different readers and have them share their lists. Having this architecture widely supported in the feed reader market would open up possibilities for higher level applications. It's a major upgrade for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; market, something a silo can't match, without ceasing to be a silo. The challenge of open networks is that they leverage their openness. This is a remarkably easy feature for feed readers to support. I've implemented it in every feed reader I've written since 2002. It never takes more than a couple of days. If you're committed to &lt;i&gt;no lock-in&lt;/i&gt; you should be all over this feature.

			<description>I've been peripherally aware that some browsers and operating systems support the idea of a &lt;i&gt;feed:&lt;/i&gt; prefix for web addresses. However I don't know the history, where the idea originated, or how widely it is supported, and what are its intended semantics? When the user clicks on a link like &lt;a href=&quot;feed:http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac, what's supposed to happen? This came up in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedBase/issues/43#issuecomment-476272480&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on feedBase work.</description>

			<title>Mueller's invisible report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We. Have. Not. Seen. The. Mueller. Report.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Analogy: You‚Äôre buying a house, so you hire an inspector. But the seller says I‚Äôll read the inspection report for you, then writes a summary that says the house doesn‚Äôt have termites (even though you can see it does) and it might have a leaky roof. Of course you buy the house.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of reporters: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Those who say the Mueller Report says such and such.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Those who say Barr won‚Äôt let us read the Mueller Report.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The latter are reporting facts. The former are rewriting a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems maybe Trump found a way to fire Mueller after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>From what I hear on MSNBC, we have no idea what the Mueller report says. We only know what Barr says the report says. Reminds me of a Watergate story. Nixon didn't want to release the tapes because they would incriminate him. So he got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Stennis&quot;&gt;Democratic senator&lt;/a&gt; from the south who mostly voted Republican to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stennis_Compromise&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/a&gt; to the tapes, and he came out and said basically Nixon is right, nothing criminal here. It didn't work. The tapes ultimately were released. The more the Repubs don't want the Mueller report released, the more it says it &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be released. No one is going to give up on this.</description>

			<description>Social topology, something I've been thinking about for a long time. When I was a math student, I got interested in graph theory, and wrote all kinds of Fortran apps that walked graphs, figuring out things about them. Not a great choice of language for that. Graph theory is part of at least two branches of math, combinatorics and topology. And I think there must be a mapping from topology to the structure of online communication systems. Looked at a particular way, we've been spending the whole of my career in tech, dating back to the 70s, studying, without any sense of the theory, the topology of net communication systems. Blogs are very different from mail lists, so different the could be considered opposites. List all the different rules for each of the following: Facebook groups, Facebook messages, public Twitter, Twitter DMs, Instagram, Snapchat, AppleLink, Reddit, Whatsapp, on and on. And the tools we use for managing developer groups also yield different kinds of social topology. I was just thinking about the difference between Slack and GitHub as two recent examples of development systems I've used.</description>

			<title>Where have you gone Walter Cronkite?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn2RjahTi3M&quot;&gt;Walter Cronkite&lt;/a&gt; did an hour special &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106775685&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite#Vietnam_War&quot;&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; was unwinnable, press coverage was pretty much re-written press releases from the Pentagon. Cronkite's observation, that the war was unwinnable, turned press coverage in a different direction. The question of whether or not we should be in Vietnam was now something they could ask, and did.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're in a similar situation now. People are covering climate change and Trump as if the normal rules of journalism can deal with these two crises. Clearly they cannot. We need a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript #1: Jon Stewart was definitely on track to be the current day Walter Cronkite before he left The Daily Show. I know he disclaimed that he was just a comedian, but he was much more than that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript #2: Three observations that address the shortcomings of news in covering the current situation. If Cronkite were alive and observing the rise of Trump and our failure to address climate change, I'd like to think he'd do a corner-turn today like the one he did in 1968 around these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Occam's Razor. If it's obvious, report it as obvious.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Common sense. Life teaches us how people are. Use that info.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is a dire situation. (Trump, climate change.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Postscript #3: The title of this piece is derived from the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C1BCAgu2I8&quot;&gt;Mrs Robinson&lt;/a&gt; by Simon and Garfunkel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning drive notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just drove back upstate from the city, listened to two hours of NPR. They had a jerk talk nonsense about the Mueller report, about how it exonerates Trump. They just let him go on and on, never interrupting to say hey you're full of shit. Then an hour later they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Wine-Banks&quot;&gt;Jill Wine-Banks&lt;/a&gt; and she was making so much sense, but they had to cut her off mid-sentence to go to an interview with a musician. This radio listener was pissed. After so much repetitive drivel, finally someone who knows the subject, who's had some time to process, is laying it out, and they have to cut her off?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, whatever the Mueller report says or doesn't say, we all witnessed his obstruction of justice in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/i-was-going-to-fire-comey-anyway-trump-tells-lester-holt-in-interview-941538371971&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Lester Holt, and if you saw his press conference in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwxqOoIyWm0&quot;&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, you understand that Trump is controlled by Putin. We don't need a report to tell us any of that. If journalism is writing the first draft of history why aren't they writing that? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I tried listening to this morning's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/podcasts/the-daily/mueller-report-russia-investigation.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the Mueller announcement, and realized finally that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-s-schmidt&quot;&gt;their reporters&lt;/a&gt; are really dull. They don't find this stuff interesting, they just namedrop and repeat bullshit they heard somewhere as gospel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Joe Biden is going to run for president. Okay. I'm &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17/135334.html#a144043&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; in favor of it. And today there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-joe-biden-stacey-abrams-vp-54472f8f-5bb2-4d1f-bc7c-0544a09ebba5.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; that to prove he's not just some random old white guy, he's going to name his running mate long before he's even won the nomination, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17/135334.html#a141900&quot;&gt;Stacey Abrams&lt;/a&gt;, a rising star of the Democratic Party. It reeks of what John McCain did in 2008 when he chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin#2008_vice-presidential_campaign&quot;&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/a&gt;. He paid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxL7MKsGoPo&quot;&gt;dearly&lt;/a&gt; for that choice. Biden should stand on his own and compete on equal terms with the other candidates. If he wins, so be it. If not, same thing. Going down this path he risks being overshadowed by his very interesting running mate, the way McCain was by his choice. He may say it proves he has guts, but what will it say when she outshines him?</description>

			<description>Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/podcasts/the-daily/boeing-737-max-ethiopia-crash.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; about Boeing's bug was interesting because bugs are starting to be mainstream life and death issues and the cost of lack of interop was frontmost in Boeing's decision to mask the difference in the two models of 737 using a compatibility bridge. Developer tool developers should be so concerned about the cost of re-training. Lots to process for techies. I listened to the podcast driving down the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway&quot;&gt;NYS Thruway&lt;/a&gt; in my Forester that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17.html#a035213&quot;&gt;nudges&lt;/a&gt; you to stay in your lane. I always think, what if there's a bug in this system, it might make my car do something like what the Boeing planes were doing. But I leave it on, because I like what it's doing, at least for now.</description>

			<title>Noisy geothermal heating</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/111&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new country house has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_heat_pump&quot;&gt;geothermal heating and cooling&lt;/a&gt;, which is something I didn't know existed until I found this house. It's supposed to be a lot less expensive. It uses electricity to move water around to transfer heat from or to a pool of underground water that's at a constant temperature of 55 degrees. In the summer, it's used to cool, in the winter to heat. Genius.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But just before the heat comes on it makes a very loud jarring sound, like a garage door slamming shut. It rocks the whole house. Wakes me up when I'm sleeping. There's no preparation for it, it just happens. It's basically not acceptable. I don't want to get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've tried searching on the net for ideas about how noisy these things are supposed to be, and no one talks about this loud sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to find someone to come out and take a look, but I don't know how to search for someone who does maintenance on geothermal heating.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love the idea, but this is not an acceptable situation. I may have to switch to conventional heating and cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: An AirBnB I rented the week before had the same problem. It was worse because the heat was going on and off all the time. So it was garage door slamming all night nonstop. Needless to say I didn't stay there the full time I had reserved it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Medium keeps changing their mind about what they are. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.medium.com/medium-seeks-partners-to-launch-new-publications-6d7df0b05159&quot;&gt;Today's change&lt;/a&gt;, for me, adds to the confusion. Yet, if you think of Medium as a publishing company, as they seem to want us to, at least for now, of all the online publishing companies, they alone have structured their product around the idea of a somewhat level playing field where there isn't (much of) a distinction between professional writers and the rest of us. The big publishing and tech companies would be wise to pay attention. Even if Medium doesn't succeed, they are exploring an idea that is imho the future of news publishing.</description>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/podcasts/the-daily/new-zealand-mosque-shooting.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; was about the terrorist attack in New Zealand. First they had interviews with victims, then quoted the prime minister about gun control and they ended with a broad trashing of the net, specifically YouTube and Facebook. But they omit a very &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=salient&quot;&gt;salient&lt;/a&gt; fact about the economics of running an open content publishing platform. You can't review each video in advance, there are too many videos and employees are too expensive. There are shades of gray, but for the NYT it's black and white. Further the reporters have a huge undisclosed conflict of interest, because the net is used for more than terrorism, it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/06/170723.html&quot;&gt;sources going direct&lt;/a&gt; to interested readers. There's a new news system trying to boot up. The same features of the net that make it possible to bootstrap a terrorism network, also enable new channels of news. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/30/salary/&quot;&gt;of course&lt;/a&gt; this is never part of their discussion. They make it sound easy. Tech is bad. Tech is responsible. Implied but not said: shut it down. They are as scary as the terrorists. Think about it.</description>

Oh that's right, there are no topic &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/futureNews.html&quot;&gt;checkboxes&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.

I just got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/18/soup.png&quot;&gt;notice&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;Progresso Soup&quot; has shipped. I ordered five different kinds of Progresso soup, wanting to try them all. I prayed that the title of the order was just one of the items they were shipping. Nope. One can of Progresso soup will arrive in its own Amazon box on Wednesday. I can see this will be a short-lived experiment.</description>

			<title>&quot;Optimizing application&quot; in Signal</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had this problem for a few days in Signal and finally have a workaround. Warning you'll lose local copies of all the messages on your desktop only.

			<description>My new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/forester/models.html&quot;&gt;Subaru Forester&lt;/a&gt; has a passive self-driving feature -- it sees the lines on the road, if you steer outside the lines, it nudges you back inside the lines through a gentle force it applies to the steering wheel. If you ease up on the grip, the car steers itself, even on winding mountain roads.</description>
