I don't know the actual time, so I took a guess. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I feel like the Mets are where they were in 2015. You tune in the game, it's the 8th inning, the Mets are down 9-3, and you sit down for the rest of the game to see how they win.

			<description>Two Democratic presidential candidates said historic things in the last week, but they have mostly gone unnoticed or misunderstood. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/bill-dagostino/2019/07/30/buttigieg-alludes-changing-2nd-amendment-cnn-moderators-ignore&quot;&gt;Pete Buttigieg&lt;/a&gt; said if we want change we're going to have to amend the Constitution. He's absolutely right. Changing the president, even taking the majority in the Senate won't accomplish much if a minority can overturn the whole thing any time they get it together. That's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, that's what has to change. Another thing that has to change is journalism. They can't incorporate new realities into their view of the world. They ask questions about Trump as if he were a normal president, one who had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-finance/trump-says-wont-divest-from-his-business-while-president-idUSKBN14V21I&quot;&gt;divested&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/the-presidents-tax-returns/&quot;&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; before taking office. Trump is a Russian oligarch. He takes his orders from Putin. Any question about the president that doesn't accept this context is a question from Dreamland. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1159116877316132864&quot;&gt;Beto O'Rourke&lt;/a&gt; busted through this crazy wall in the aftermath of the El Paso massacre. It's why we need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/depose&quot;&gt;depose&lt;/a&gt; the people who run journalism, asap. Why shouldn't the Democratic candidates help us transform politics and journalism? If they don't do that, why are they running? (To paraphrase Elizabeth Warren, who has done her &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/454500-warren-presses-pelosi-on-impeachment-some-things-are-above-politics&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; to transform how our politics and journalism work.)</description>

			<title>Why we fear death</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a theory about why we fear death. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a survival trait. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Animals that didn't fear death died. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Animals that feared death tended to live. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words most of us are descended from animals that were scared of dying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My dear departed hippie &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt; started a bums union. They would revoke your union card if you were caught working. He gave it a name. The Amalgamated Bums and Drifters of America. It was a joke of course. He loved to work.</description>

			<title>Preparing for 25 years</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On October 7, this blog will have existed and been continually updated for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were times I took as much as a couple of weeks off, but I usually blogged when I was traveling. I have observations, things I want to write down, basically all the time. I don't see the blog as work, to me it's more like a part of living.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It may be hard to remember this, but in the early days net connections away from home were exceptional. You didn't get internet connectivity in hotels, there were no cell phones. I once went for a two-week massage course without being able to check my email once. Even listening to voicemail required a drive into town! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot of other things happened while this blog was running. Needless to say there were no blogs when it started. There was only email, no instant messaging. No RSS or podcasting, no Twitter, Facebook, Google. Amazon and Netscape were less than a year old. Microsoft tried to take over the web and failed. Steve Jobs came back to Apple and brought us the iPhone. And much more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm thinking about how I want to celebrate this. It'll be the first time I put any forethought into such a thing. We went through 5, 10, 15 and 20 years with very little in the way of observation. Not sure why this one is special, but it seems that it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I'd like to know, are there any of the original email subscribers from 1994 around still reading the blog or on the net even? Does anyone have any of the original &quot;Amusing rants from Dave Winer's desktop&quot; emails? I'd actually like to know the exact time on 10/7/94 that the first email went out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to hear from people who read this stuff as it was booting up, as it started from a way to promote a friend's event, to a report on the event, to observations on tech products, to gestalts about &lt;i&gt;holy shit this is an incredible medium&lt;/i&gt; posts. It didn't take long for it to become clear that something interesting was happening here. I wonder what it looked like from the other side of the net connection. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some people said for sure what Dave is doing is preparing to compete with Stewart and Esther, charging $495 per year for a newsletter, and $2000 a year for an industry conference. I was never thinking about that, this blog has never had a business model. I never wanted it to, and I've written about why. I'm sure I could find it if anyone is interested. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway if you have a story to tell about this, email me at dave.winer@gmail.com. What did it feel like to receive the emails. What did you think was happening? When did it occur to you that you could write like I was or did it? Anything that you want to say I'm interested in hearing as long as it isn't flamey. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why change hurts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ben Thompson &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1158623851376304128&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The new Twitter for web is hilariously better than the old Twitter. It is amazing the degree to which people hate change.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1158696279544946688&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Thereâ€™s a reason. We incorporate the mechanics of software at a subconscious level after repeated use. Itâ€™s not amazing that we hate change, itâ€™s rational. Something that used to 'just work' now takes effort to control. Until we incorporate the new UI at a subconscious level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1158698843564847106&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'm typing this on a QWERTY keyboard.&quot; Some standard UIs are so strong that they can never be changed. The original &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY&quot;&gt;QWERTY&lt;/a&gt; design was optimized to prevent a mechanical &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter&quot;&gt;typewriter&lt;/a&gt; from jamming. The keyboard on the iPad I typed that tweet on was completely implemented in software. Nothing that can ever get jammed. But the original reason it was designed that way is long forgotten. It's just the way keyboards are done. There have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin-script_keyboard_layouts&quot;&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; to change the design, but they proved too unpopular. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1158702258353258496&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. I can drive any car because there are invariant UI standards for basic controls. I might not be able to control air conditioning or the radio, but I can steer, accelerate, brake, indicate a turn, the same way on every car. It would be chaos if every time you rented a car you'd have to re-learn how to drive. That said, try renting a car in the UK, Jamaica or Japan where everything is on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic#History&quot;&gt;other side&lt;/a&gt;. It takes a long time to get used to it, even though at a conscious level the difference is simple to understand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet another example, one I like to cite a lot -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/12/weAreBreakingYourCityDealWithIt.html&quot;&gt;imagine&lt;/a&gt; if they remapped the streets of a city. &quot;Broadway will run east-west instead of the old inefficient north-south route. Now it will connect the Hudson and East rivers! You'll be able to use Broadway to get to Brooklyn or New Jersey. We encourage developers to build new tunnels that cross these two wonderful third-party opportunities.&quot; It doesn't work that way in real cities, but software platforms, managed by Google, Apple or Facebook (examples) often do. Nowadays even &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;open platforms&lt;/a&gt; do. Ugh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It helps to know something</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR -- everyone in tech could benefit from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science&quot;&gt;semester&lt;/a&gt; of Computer Science, to help them understand how the products are created. Just like someone in the auto industry should know a bit about how cars work, or in the wine industry how grapes are farmed and turned into wine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was just telling a story to Kevin Tofel over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KevinCTofel/posts/10157548873102082&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; about my first experiences dealing with analysts in the tech industry in the 80s. Kevin is a journalist and a consultant for tech companies. He plays a similar role to the early analysts, in today's context. He's taking Computer Science classes. I've been following along, remembering when the concepts he's learning now were fresh for me. It was a great time of discovery, I love how computers work, then and now -- and it's gratifying, in a way, that they still teach the same basic data structures. I guess they never change? I like that. Linked lists, balanced trees, hash tables and the like. I hope they have him build a compiler, that was the last mystery for me. Once I understood that there's no magic to it, I was ready to learn everything about computers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it amazed me when I was starting out in tech that the expensive analysts had never taken a class in computer science. Didn't understand the basic components of a computer. I wasn't sure how to talk to them. I wanted someone to understand how our outliners worked, and how we had tried two internal models before finding a third that had the good qualities of both and none of the bad. I thought one of the analysts should understand how the increasing capabilities of PCs made these decisions easier, and how we were planning future products based on further expected improvements. When you come down to it, the algorithms Kevin is learning now were important performance considerations for the software we were making, especially in the 80s when computers weren't as capable as they are today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I sold out to a medium-size tech company and they did their strategic planning by inviting one of the analysts in, asking what they should do, and then doing what they said. It was as if you ran a $100 million software company by asking Norm what products you should make. (Norm is Kevin's dog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMMhZu6-zCM9bc-4Tc6AJP46Hx1tiS-A9BEHNUfFy0YQsp8tlynNOauUt_dy8VVVA?key=RTlfWVQ0T21IbTVnZE9laGMtak55dWR4cVdNV01R&quot;&gt;cute&lt;/a&gt; and opinionated, but not too knowledgable about the economics of software.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I learned is this -- you have to relate to the analysts based on feelings. They have to feel as if you know what you're doing and then they'll echo what you say in your press releases to reporters looking for a quote. Another way to get them on your side was to pay them, by subscribing to the newsletters ($495 per year) and going to their conferences (another $2K per), and if you really were rich you could buy their consulting services (I suppose that the company I sold out to did). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What was interesting/funny is that they sometimes found the trends that mattered even though there's no earthly reason they should have. Maybe they tapped into some thread of knowledge that I didn't. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Kevin is a journalist and a consultant for tech companies. He plays a similar role to the early analysts, in today's context. He's taking Computer Science classes. I've been following along, remembering when the concepts he's learning now were fresh for me. It was a great time of discovery, I love how computers work, then and now -- and it's gratifying, in a way, that they still teach the same basic data structures. I guess they never change? I like that. Linked lists, balanced trees, hash tables and the like. I hope they have him build a compiler, that was the last mystery for me. Once I understood that there's no magic to it, I was ready to learn everything about computers." created="Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:45:26 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/05/norm.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/05/133745.html#a134526"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway, it amazed me when I was starting out in tech that the expensive analysts had never taken a class in computer science. Didn't understand the basic components of a computer. I wasn't sure how to talk to them. I wanted someone to understand how our outliners worked, and how we had tried two internal models before finding a third that had the good qualities of both and none of the bad. I thought one of the analysts should understand how the increasing capabilities of PCs made these decisions easier, and how we were planning future products based on further expected improvements. When you come down to it, the algorithms Kevin is learning now were important performance considerations for the software we were making, especially in the 80s when computers weren't as capable as they are today." created="Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:40:20 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/05/133745.html#a134020"/>
				<source:outline text="Then I sold out to a medium-size tech company and they did their strategic planning by inviting one of the analysts in, asking what they should do, and then doing what they said. It was as if you ran a $100 million software company by asking Norm what products you should make. (Norm is Kevin's dog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMMhZu6-zCM9bc-4Tc6AJP46Hx1tiS-A9BEHNUfFy0YQsp8tlynNOauUt_dy8VVVA?key=RTlfWVQ0T21IbTVnZE9laGMtak55dWR4cVdNV01R&quot;&gt;cute&lt;/a&gt; and opinionated, but not too knowledgable about the economics of software.)" created="Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:43:19 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/05/133745.html#a134319"/>
				<source:outline text="What I learned is this -- you have to relate to the analysts based on feelings. They have to feel as if you know what you're doing and then they'll echo what you say in your press releases to reporters looking for a quote. Another way to get them on your side was to pay them, by subscribing to the newsletters ($495 per year) and going to their conferences (another $2K per), and if you really were rich you could buy their consulting services (I suppose that the company I sold out to did)." created="Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:43:57 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/05/133745.html#a134357"/>
				<source:outline text="What was interesting/funny is that they sometimes found the trends that mattered even though there's no earthly reason they should have. Maybe they tapped into some thread of knowledge that I didn't. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:44:40 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/05/133745.html#a134440"/>

It'll probably be a Russian style election where the incumbent gets 98% of the vote. We can't afford to wait for that. Think about all the other crazy stuff the incumbent is doing, that we can see, and then the stuff that is being covered up. Depending on the election only makes sense as a distant Plan B. I think even most Republicans would see that at this time.</description>

			<title>Mailchimp testing results</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yudel&quot;&gt;Larry Yudelson&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime reader of this blog has a commercial Mailchimp account and offered to let me use it to test nightly emails for the blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I get one test per day. Reminds me of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card&quot;&gt;punched cards&lt;/a&gt; days of mainframes, only worse. Turnaround generally was less than an hour back then. It's okay though, I find it somewhat relaxing to consider Mailchimp only once per day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://us2.campaign-archive.com/?e=9b37eab71e&amp;u=872b6dc1474d8545c737dfc44&amp;id=89c814d14c&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the email for yesterday's blog posts.  I'm not sure how long that link will work, so here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/post.zip&quot;&gt;archived copy&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/emailtop.png&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of screen &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/emailbottom.png&quot;&gt;shots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few notes follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have been able to fix a bunch of the problems &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/scriptingnightlyrss/email.css&quot;&gt;using CSS&lt;/a&gt;. But some I can't fix because they put the styles inline. No way to override those as far as I know. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I could I'd get rid of the top two items. They repeat info included elsewhere. They're the kind of noise people rightly skip over. I like to take that kind of noise out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They chose a really ugly color for links, and hard-code the font for headlines.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's funny however that some of my overrides work when I view the email &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/correctRendering.png&quot;&gt;in the browser&lt;/a&gt;, vs &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/03/wrongRendering.png&quot;&gt;in GMail&lt;/a&gt;. In GMail their styles dominate. In the browser, mine do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The way my email address appears in the &lt;i&gt;By&lt;/i&gt; line abuses the &amp;lt;author&gt; element in &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. If I wanted it to link to an HTML page about me, instead of providing my email address (a real mistake), I would have to break the &amp;lt;author&gt; element. That's fucked up. They should have a namespace that calls for exactly what they want and not force people to break RSS to get a good result. Interop isn't any use if people don't respect it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I can't make it perfect, but I can make it okay. I'm thinking of trying another service that has an API and see if I can make it perform better. They do call this blog &lt;i&gt;Scripting&lt;/i&gt; News after all. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/02/listeningToUsers.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about journalism and listening to users, based on a ridiculous Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1156925544421908482&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about journalism and listening in which of course the journalists didn't listen. Imho that's why our political system is so out of whack. The public is never heard, their perspective is never represented, and we are never allowed to interject our two cents. I only shared it with Ken Smith, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://clas.iusb.edu/english/faculty/smith.html&quot;&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; friend from Indiana. He says he was nodding in agreement through the whole thing. Okay, considering that, I decided I should publish it. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. If you're a journalist you probably won't but you should listen anyway. No pain no gain, as they say.</description>

			<description>I don't think the NBA works &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/8/1/20749687/carmelo-anthony-comeback-nba&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;, though emotionally I would hate to see Melo's career end now. Same with Jeremy Lin. I think Melo being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/02/meloLin.png&quot;&gt;stinker&lt;/a&gt; put Lin and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D%27Antoni&quot;&gt;D'Antonio&lt;/a&gt; on the road. I'd like to see Melo apologize to Lin, and make a condition of his restitution that his buddy JL has to be included in the deal. Both role players. Melo a bench forward, Lin a bench guard. They work out together and make something new out of their respective talents.</description>

			<description>It'd be interesting to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;BloggerCon-style&lt;/a&gt; mini-conference on grounds for impeaching Trump, with a note-taker, organizing the ideas into an outline in real-time. I see so many ideas, ones that would force Repubs in the House and Senate to vote against Mom and apple pie. One random idea you never hear in the news -- how about impeaching him for hate crimes, inciting violence against blacks, to begin with. Never mind that it would be a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_out_the_vote&quot;&gt;GOTV&lt;/a&gt; tactic, and also for fund-raising, it would force Repubs to admit they are Nazis. The sooner they decloak, imho, the better. (BTW, I don't think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/moscow-mitch-mcconnell.html&quot;&gt;Moscow Mitch&lt;/a&gt; can table impeachment. The Senate has to actually vote. Key point people overlook.)</description>
