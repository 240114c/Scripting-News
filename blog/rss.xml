			<description>Given that Facebook is now known to be a shitshow, hopefully they can do a better job of peering with the open web so we have a way out, and arenâ€™t betting the whole future of online discourse on it.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/103&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: Are you a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://decorrespondent.nl/&quot;&gt;De Correspondent&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands? What, in your own words, makes it different from other news orgs? There's been a lot of hype as they start up in the US. It would be interesting to hear about it from a member's perspective. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>I'm tired of being the audience. I want to be part of the news system. Not a passive part. Contributing experience, point of view, ability to write, and hope for our species to survive. To pass on what I know. To help. To be useful. All the models of news as an industry are meant to get us to give them money while lying to us that we're part of their process. Our job is to give them money and then chill while they run the world. I don't like how they're running the world. Maybe news wasn't meant to be an industry. Maybe it's a calling, a passion, a civic responsibility. No one pays you to vote or sit on a jury. We have to re-think news on a grand scale. And the news people refuse to do that.</description>

			<description>Yesterday Quartz &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zseward/status/1062377844196737029&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new membership-based publishing system, and today Jay Rosen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1062692770131906560&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a membership drive on behalf of &lt;a href=&quot;https://decorrespondent.nl/&quot;&gt;De Correspondent&lt;/a&gt;, a Dutch-originated news org. Of course I know Jay from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; we did a few years ago, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zseward&quot;&gt;Zach Seward&lt;/a&gt; is one of the top guys at Quartz, who I knew from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/&quot;&gt;Nieman Lab&lt;/a&gt; and also when I was at NYU. These are both smart people who have roots in blogging. However, both efforts have a limited view of the contributions of members. I wrote about this, tangentially, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/13/181952.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, about the line that separates us from journalism. That line is where the attention must focus. These are the small steps people rooted in journalism are comfortable with. The real problem imho remains making &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22sources+go+direct%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Sources Go Direct&lt;/a&gt; really work. News as-it-is is promoting the failure of democracy, not standing up for it. Imho of course, ymmv, I've been wrong before, my mother loves me, I am not a lawyer, etc. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Something bothered me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/media/cnn-sues-trump/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN's protest&lt;/a&gt; of their reporter being excluded from the White House. It took me a while to pinpoint. I guess they would like us to have their back -- but do they have ours? They do so many things that sell us out as they chase profit. It's as if they've found a way to monetize America's failure. Maybe one of these events will wake them up and they'll realize they aren't protected anymore than we are, and they should do what they can to halt our descent, even if it makes them lose money. Until they do that, I don't see why I should care whose reporters are in the White House carrying the Republican message.</description>

			<description>I was just telling a friend about Al Pacino's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myyWXKeBsNk&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. I know a lot of people don't like sports movies but this one is the story of age, how the coach and the young quarterback (played by Jamie Foxx)  learn to work together. It's got all the schmaltz of typical sports movie. But the acting is so good, and the story simple and universal and heart-grabbing. Old people remember being young. We aren't young anymore, but we have experience and knowledge to offer, and when we work together the winning is so much sweeter. I would like the newly elected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/20/pelosi-democrats-candidates-midterms-655484&quot;&gt;Democrat reps&lt;/a&gt; to watch this movie and work with Nancy Pelosi. She knows how to win. We have a really big problem to solve and we have to work together to solve it. If we don't work together, we'll die as individuals.</description>

			<title>Journalism's line separating us from them</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think the problem with journalism in 2018 is that it relies on a centralized model, journalists who are paid salaries and everyone else  who pays to read what the salaried journalists produce. It's not all the way there yet, but it's close. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But -- who really wants to read what the paid journalists write? And why? And what about the knowledge and perspectives of the readers, why are they wasted in this model? I understand why they were wasted in the pre-Internet world, because the cost of distribution was prohibitive, but that's no longer an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The standard answer, which I don't disagree with is how do you separate the wheat from the chaff?

				<source:outline text="I think the problem with journalism in 2018 is that it relies on a centralized model, journalists who are paid salaries and everyone else  who pays to read what the salaried journalists produce.

			<description>I've been making a lot of phone calls lately on my iPhone (6, iOS 12.1), and the volume on the calls is way too low. I have to force the phone to my ear and it still needs to be louder. I've turned the volume on the phone all the way up. What can I do? (Update: Heres'a a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iphonetopics.com/iphone-6-plus-volume/&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of things I tried. I think the volume went up. I'll find out for sure on my next phone conversation.)</description>

			<description>I changed the way the thumb works in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/102&quot;&gt;Like&lt;/a&gt;. Now, when you click the thumb, it fills in, when you click it again it toggles to being open. It used to flip to down. This was confusing. Now it doesn't flip, it's always up. I think this feels better, burns fewer braincells.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just had a brief chat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/om&quot;&gt;Om&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. Here's what I said.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I liked your &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/om/status/1061627707849654272&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the blogger who tells her story. I saw Matt Haughey post something the other day lamenting there weren't more bloggers. I responded that there aren't that many bloggers. We're different.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I thought, if this were an industry we would have a PR firm that made sure we were included in important discussions, about law, policy, society, culture.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's one of the things that's wrong. We develop great stuff, then the pros come in, take it over, miss the point, and drive it in the wrong direction. Or forget the roots, or don't protect its openness.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's so weird that I can't even get into the covnersation about podcasting, something that I personally developed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Had a great talk this morning with Chuck Shotton. We've been doing projects together on and off for decades. A few thoughts. I spend most of my programming time refactoring code for different purposes. I learned the benefits of modularity almost at the beginning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal&quot;&gt;UCSD Pascal&lt;/a&gt; had the concept of units, which were more clean and simple and powerful at the same time than the equivalent in JavaScript today, almost &lt;i&gt;forty&lt;/i&gt; years later. Also we had a Lambda-like code environment in Frontier in the mid-90s. Cleaner and quite a bit more efficient imho. I have been modularizing my Node code, but haven't come close to the level of factoring we did with Frontier. No conclusions, just interesting to observe how glitchy progress is.</description>

			<source:outline text="Had a great talk this morning with Chuck Shotton. We've been doing projects together on and off for decades. A few thoughts. I spend most of my programming time refactoring code for different purposes. I learned the benefits of modularity almost at the beginning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal&quot;&gt;UCSD Pascal&lt;/a&gt; had the concept of units, which were more clean and simple and powerful at the same time than the equivalent in JavaScript today, almost &lt;i&gt;forty&lt;/i&gt; years later. Also we had a Lambda-like code environment in Frontier in the mid-90s. Cleaner and quite a bit more efficient imho. I have been modularizing my Node code, but haven't come close to the level of factoring we did with Frontier. No conclusions, just interesting to observe how glitchy progress is." created="Sat, 10 Nov 2018 16:16:24 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/10/football.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/11/10.html#a161624"/>

			<description>A rambling 22-minute &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/09/electionRamblings.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/07/142734.html&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;. Why it's important to savor victory. There was a lot of good news in Tuesday's results. Feel the winning. The political system might be killing us, but America, underneath it all, is still America. Most important, by giving the House to a party that will do real oversight, we re-asserted the control by the people over the government. Whether you support Trump or not, this has to be seen as good.</description>

			<description>Obama should go on a victory tour now, hold rallies to drive home what we accomplished by showing up to vote. Host SNL. Visit with Jimmy Kimmel. Do an interview with the NYT. He's the one Democrat who can't be accused of campaigning for 2020. Solidify the message, we asked people to vote, and they did, and look what we accomplished. When I ran a company, I always made my sales people visit the distributors after we shipped a hit product. It wasn't for sales, it was to soak of the feeling of winning.</description>

			<description>Theory why Trump fired Sessions and appointed Whitaker now. They know Mueller is about to issue his report. They wanted to move first, do something, anything, to be able to say they were on top of it.

			<title>Heartbreak and trust</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a failed friendship, relationship, business partnership? I'm beginning to think most people haven't, based on their willingness to forget that Trump is a lying con artist who is being blackmailed by Putin and probably a dozen other countries by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend posted: &quot;This will be an easily disproven lie&quot; about something Trump said. Please. It's like a wife who's sleeping around. Everyone knows but you (the spouse). Trump always lies. It's more interesting to try to prove he's not lying.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story, with Trump, always --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't take the bait.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>About a protest about Trump firing Sessions. Too early. Let Congress do their job. Let the courts. If they fail, then a march will be huge. Right now, with the election just over, a big victory for the people, for oversight, for health care, the power of the people is just now settling in with our elected reps. The ones who are coming back should feel we have their back if they stand up to Trump. Right now the risk of failure of a protest is too high. It's just the wrong time. As Teddy Roosevelt &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Stick_ideology&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, speak softly and carry a big stick. The people are carrying. Clearly. We just spoke. Let's find out if they heard.</description>

			<description>I don't care &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/181107/p177#a181107p177&quot;&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; the White House &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/07/media/trump-cnn-press-conference/&quot;&gt;lets&lt;/a&gt; into their press events. For a couple of reasons. I don't think any news org should send reporters to those events. Too much lying. But if they did, they should report on the lies as lies, not misrepresentations or whatever &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word&quot;&gt;weasel words&lt;/a&gt; they use to describe the lies. And I especially don't care if CNN is there. I blame them for the Trump presidency. Journalism has to be done consciously. What Trump was doing in the years leading up to the 2016 election was terrorism. Race hate. Stuff that when/if we get past this will be illegal. It certainly was unethical for CNN to give Trump such coverage. Now the chickens have home to roost. You reap what you sow. Maybe if they're forced to sit outside of these supposed press conferences they'll reflect on what's really happening, and their role in it. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa&quot;&gt;mea culpa&lt;/a&gt; going back to the beginning of Political Trump would help get me to listen to their side. But no such admission has come. Bottom line: I don't see what they do as journalism.</description>

			<description>With all possible humility, I wish pieces like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/07/142734.html&quot;&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; I wrote yesterday about the election got more attention. 20 years ago (arrgh) I had a column in Wired that worked wonders. I think part of the reason blogging took off the way it did is because they gave me space to write about it every week. I've asked many people if they know any editors at major political pubs who might give me a column like that. For example, yesterday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/07/142734.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; that's highly contrarian but also I think more accurate than the account of the election that journalism put together. That will all soon be cemented as conventional wisdom. The time to get an idea in the mix is now past. My blog doesn't have enough pull to get into the conversation. Sadly, journalists only listen to other journalists, it seems. We're already three news cycles past the election, first there was the Sessions firing, Jim Acosta being outsted by the White House and the shooting in Southern California. But the lessons from the election are very important. Very important and being lost.</description>

			<title>Generalizing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I often talk about journalists or journalism as if it were a monolith, and of course it isn't. There is divergence of views, but there is also conventional wisdom, and access journalism and the economics, all of which drive journalism to a sameness. An example, in the mid 90s the conventional wisdom was that there was no new Mac software. You'd see it reported everywhere. It wasn't true. It just made it impossible to launch new software, so eventually it became self-fullfilling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays in political writing the rut they've fallen into is making the news a theatrical play about the personalities at the top, and overlooks the real import of politiics, what it means for the people who are governed. Not just in the aggregate, but as individuals. Journalism if it ever had the ability to tell that story seems to have lost it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The forces that drive journalism to the same place, may also be there for software. After all, I'm working in JavaScript now. Why? Because so many other people are, there are many incentives to use the same language everyone else does. (And of course I'm taking license with the term &quot;everyone&quot; -- of course other languages are also very popular.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The sameness of political writing makes the outstanding writers stand out even more. Jon Chait is consistently original, thoughtful and thought-provoking at New York Mag. I can't remember reading a piece of his that I didn't feel was both worth passing on and right on the money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>An idea for the new Democratic majority in the House. Pass a bill that fixes all the problems in ObamaCare. Suggest the Senate could ratify it and the President could sign it. A victory for everyone. The Dems prove that leadership works better than obstruction.</description>

			<title>We won!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The top line of the news re yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/midterm-elections/2018/11/7/18070802/midterm-elections-results-2018-republicans-losses-trump-house-democrats-majority&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; in the US is that we won. The Constitution won. The US gets another chance. We don't get flushed down the autocracy  toilet, at least not yet. Now here are some bullet points.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A lot of people who voted for Trump in 2016 voted for a Democrat this year to represent them in the House. The entire House was up for election, so the results indicate the choice of all of America. Only 34 Senate seats were contested, and the nature of the Senate, where tiny North Dakota gets as much representation as California or New York, doesn't tell you so much about the collective mind of the people. And in the Senate the Dems were on the defense, Repubs on offense. What we can see from the results of this election is that if the mood of the electorate is constant, the Repubs will have a much harder time retaining control in 2020. And Trump, if he chooses to run again, will have a much harder time winning in 2020 than he did in 2016. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Journalists are reporting that Congress is divided now like the rest of the country. That's such bullshit. As if the government was designed to be controlled by one party with the Congress subservient to the executive branch. What they call &quot;division&quot; is actually democracy. We all get a voice in governing. In 2017 and 2018, the majority of the electorate was shut out of governing. We had no say. As a result the Repubs have run wild with corruption and really stupid decisions (heard of climate change, the Repubs don't believe in it, for example). Now we return to the normal process of governing, where one faction doesn't control the whole thing, and if we want to move, we have to compromise. Yes, that's been rare in the last decade, but a logjam is preferable to one party running rampant. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Imagine if it had gone the other way, and the Repubs had retained control of the House. Imagine the demons that would have been unleashed by that.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Oversight. I heard a reporter on NPR say that now there will be &quot;more oversight.&quot; I suppose technically that's true, but it doesn't really capture the essence. We're going from zero oversight to hopefully intelligent oversight. Imagine the Mafia taking over the government and the police and you have an idea of what the last two years have been like. Now we have a way of looking into the crimes of the Trumps, maybe because they know they'll be exposed they'll be a little less bold? Either way we'll get some ability to see behind the bullshit now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Who will lead the oversight? Very capable people. My own rep, Jerry Nadler will be chairman of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://judiciary.house.gov/&quot;&gt;Judiciary&lt;/a&gt; committee. Elijah Cummings will chair the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oversight.house.gov/&quot;&gt;Oversight&lt;/a&gt; committee. &lt;a href=&quot;https://intelligence.house.gov/&quot;&gt;Adam Schiff&lt;/a&gt; on Intelligence and Maxine Waters on &lt;a href=&quot;https://financialservices.house.gov/&quot;&gt;Financial Services&lt;/a&gt;.  All are a vast improvement over the hacks the Repubs put in those jobs. And I say that without a hint of partisanship. If any of the Repubs had had the courage to actually do their jobs in the last Congress, I would be singing their praises and the country wouldn't be in such a deep hole. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Most important -- the American people are not fascists. Yes there are some who hate Jews and people of color and Muslims and gays and people who don't think like them. Too many. But the majority of Americans are good, and eventually saw through all the confusion the Repubs throw at the process. I expect that more will see it that way in the coming years. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't know what a &quot;wave election&quot; is and I don't care. I just care that we came back from the edge yesterday and decided as a country to fight. That's as much good news as I could have hoped for, a very good outcome. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a Democrat or Republican. I voted Republican until 2004, when I saw where they were taking us and I became a committed member of the resistance. I couldn't believe we re-elected Bush. And all the events that followed. I could vote Republican again, or even better would love to be part of a new party formed with people who may disagree on all kinds of policy issues, but agree on regular order and the sanctity of the vote and the rule of law. A party that would never try to suppress people's vote, or create misery to try to win elections. A party with real respect for the people. From there we can debate and compromise, win some, lose some, and live our lives with respect for each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think my new iMac Pro is more sensitive about wifi connections than my previous iMac, where I could leave a Terminal window open to a server for &lt;i&gt;weeks&lt;/i&gt; and it would stay up. Now, typically, I have to restore the connection every the morning. The only variable that changed on my end is the computer and of course the OS.</description>

			<description>An idea for a simple web service. Watch your own Twitter account and keep an outline of all your posts, ready to be copy/pasted into your blog or emails or other writing. This didn't used to be interesting because of the 140 char limit, but 280 is enough to write down an idea. It's easier for me to jot down an idea on my phone in Twitter than in another app. And their API makes this even more useful.</description>
