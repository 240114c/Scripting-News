			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/business/media/consumer-reports-craig-newmark.html&quot;&gt;Journalism&lt;/a&gt; has been very conflicted about Craig Newmark. Truth is he isn't responsible for anything other than making a product that people wanted. The news industry could have done it, but for some reason didn't.</description>

			<description>There will come a day when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/05/142857.html&quot;&gt;presidential candidate&lt;/a&gt; will be judged by where they choose to post their policy statements. If they use a corporate silo, that will be like accepting campaign donations from Goldman Sachs. Not a good appearance.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing thing, but there are places it just doesn't work, like what we used to call &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig&quot;&gt;The Big Dig&lt;/a&gt; in Boston. Too many levels of tunnels. GPS can't tell if you're underground or on the surface.</description>

			<title>Why Elizabeth Warren should be on the open web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It bothers me, of course, that Elizabeth Warren, &lt;a href=&quot;https://elizabethwarren.com/&quot;&gt;candidate&lt;/a&gt; for president, is posting her position papers on Medium. I wrote a tweet yesterday, and cross-posted it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/04.html#a174639&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, saying as much. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cbasturea&quot;&gt;Constantin Basturea&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime reader of this blog, did a bit of research and found the Twitter accounts of the people who run the Warren web presence, suggesting I contact them. At first I thought, they won't know who I am, and they might not care about the open web. But then I thought, why wouldn't they care?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of parallels in the ways big tech companies and banks regard their customers, and Warren has been such a pioneer in the reform of banks. It's a bad environmental decision, imho, for Warren to go with Medium, when the open web is just as easy, the results are as good, and the writing more likely to persist. It's worth a careful explanation of why the open web is a better choice for a thoughtful and futuristic campaign like Warren's. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Writing for the record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Senator Warren posts a position paper, it's a matter of public record. It's important that it be accessible for the indefinite future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If she was elected, her consituents would want to see what she promised during the campaign, in her own words, to see how it matches up with her policies as an elected official.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if she isn't elected, it's still good to keep the ideas accessible. The problems probably won't go away, and her proposals might be useful to a future candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Preserving ideas is something the web can be good at, but we have to make the right choices.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Medium is not a good choice for creating a public record.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium could go out of business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Medium went out of business everything published there would go away. This has happened many times in tech, it's the norm. Even successful companies, such as Google, sometimes walk away from existing sites because they weren't profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium does not have a stable business model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their software is good, easy to use, and the resulting pages are easy to read. But this is the only thing that has been stable about Medium since its inception in 2012, as they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/the-long-complicated-and-extremely-frustrating-history-of-medium-2012-present/&quot;&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=0Ob3XLOzO5Hr_QbByIaQBQ&amp;q=medium+pivots+ev+williams&amp;oq=medium+pivots+ev+williams&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.12..35i39.1587.1587..5947...0.0..0.125.206.1j1......0....2j1..gws-wiz.....0.rK_ZPDUKiEA&quot;&gt;pivot&lt;/a&gt; trying to find a profitable business model.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium has a paywall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear whether Warren's posts are behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall&quot;&gt;paywall&lt;/a&gt;, because their policies are not clear, and they change. Sometimes I hit a wall reading a random friend's post on Medium. The paywall is not only an irritant, but it limits access to people who have a credit card and are able to pay Medium for access. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set an example for others&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People look at Medium and if they've been around a while, the questions above all come up, but then they see that a great progressive like Senator Warren is using Medium, so it must be okay. This is not good leadership, especially when setting up and running a blog in 2019 is so inexpensive and easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My politics happen to align pretty well with Warren's, but even if I were a conservative Republican, I'd want to help get Senator Warren on the open web, because it's that important to have a serious presidential campaign take a leadership position on the independence of people who write on the open web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; would set an example and not post her position papers &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-green-manufacturing-plan-for-america-fc0ad53ab614&quot;&gt;on a silo&lt;/a&gt;. Her archive isnâ€™t very robust since she doesnâ€™t control the domain. Pretty sure itâ€™s behind a paywall. She could set a great example of how to use an open and free web.</description>

			<description>I've been working on the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html&quot;&gt;River&lt;/a&gt; product. This time I'm using a MySQL database. Three tables -- feeds, items and subscriptions. The folder structure is exactly as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/09/0995.html&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt;, except there is no data folder (the data is in the database). I am still a relative newbie in SQL databases, but I think this model works. I'm documenting as much as I can and of course I will release the Node.js source. I hope it serves as a basis for distributing RSS intelligence around the net. Last time around (Google Reader) we centralized. That was a mistake. If enough people run instances of this database we'll have a less interruptable base of functionality. I want to try out more new ideas as well. We've been really stuck for a long time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If journalism had the ability to look at itself critically, the way it looks at Facebook, they would find a smoking gun in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464&quot;&gt;Les Moonves quote&lt;/a&gt; from 2016. You could argue whether Facebook knew it was profiting from Trump trolling, but there's absolutely no doubt that journalism was. We need a Mueller report on this too. Any journalism outfit could do it, btw. They have access to all the sources. There should be a Pulitzer in it. But of course none of them will do it. it would require an integrity they don't have.</description>

			<title>How Old School works</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My longtime friend Stan Krute sent an email asking how I do my blog. Rather than do a one-off email, I am going to explain it via blog post, so it's documented publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the spring of 2017, I wrote a piece of software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;. It's a Node.js server app that is configured via a big JSON file. It handles incoming REST-style messages telling it to build blogs that it knows about via the JSON file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I write the blog content with an outliner, and the result is a big OPML file. The server software (Old School) knows where to look for the OPML file, via the config.json file. You can use any outliner to edit the content as long as it produces an OPML file as output. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I archive the content of the blog in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see how the content works, going back to May 2017. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &amp;lt;head&gt; elements of the OPML file also configure Old School and it contains information other applications might find useful. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22old+school%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for Old School on my blog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even though Old School is undocumented and unsupported, I did provide an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog/tree/master/examples/helloworld&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt;. Never know when I will need to install a second instance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The outliner I use is called Electric Outliner. I've never shipped it, and don't have any plans to. I got tired of supporting &quot;products&quot; that few if any people use. This, and Old School were the first two products I made just for myself. It's cool, because the users of the product really respect &lt;i&gt;the hell&lt;/i&gt; out of the developer, and the developer knows the users will understand the software even with no docs. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; -- it's very similar to EO, in fact the core outliner is the same code. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I want to attach a video to a post, I add an attribute called &lt;i&gt;urlvideo, &lt;/i&gt;which points to a YouTube file. The runtime of the blog, a browser-based JavaScript app, looks for these attributes when the page is loaded, and builds the necessary structures. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Similarly for &lt;i&gt;urltweet, &lt;/i&gt;which points to a tweet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you put an attribute named &lt;i&gt;flNumberedSubs&lt;/i&gt; on a headline, Old School generates an &amp;lt;ol&gt; element. &lt;i&gt;flBulletedSubs&lt;/i&gt; generates an &amp;lt;ul&gt; element.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you put an attribute named &lt;i&gt;image&lt;/i&gt; on an element, its value should be the address of an image, i.e. something that can be put in the src attribute of an &amp;lt;img&gt; element. Old School adds it to the output with a CSS style of float: right. That's how I create right-margin images that I love so much. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That reminds me, you can use emoji &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;short codes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Old School also supports a glossary, a CMS idea that goes back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/claydataglossary.html&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;. It's a simple two-column table represented in an outline. It does string substitutions of the top-level string with its sub-head's value. The glossary I use for Scripting News is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/misc/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt; in the repo. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about this, post a comment in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/117&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's how I create right-margin images that I love so much." created="Sun, 02 Jun 2019 15:12:16 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/07/21/trumpHead.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html#a151216"/>

					<source:outline text="Old School also supports a glossary, a CMS idea that goes back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/claydataglossary.html&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;. It's a simple two-column table represented in an outline. It does string substitutions of the top-level string with its sub-head's value.
