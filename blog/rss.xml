			<description>There comes a point where our minds are closed, we're not interested in considering there might be an innocence for people who stand by Trump. We're over that line now. You're dragging the rest of us to hell and we don't want to go there. Republicans this is on you.</description>

			<description>Iâ€™d like to see a courageous journalist tackle &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1201503802735693825&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; story. Why do Repub politicians sound like Russians? Iâ€™d like to know. Note I use the word &lt;i&gt;courageous&lt;/i&gt; sarcastically. There's nothing courageous about investigating an obvious question. It's ridiculous that not one reporter has done this story. It's a scandal happening out in the open. But it doesn't fit a model that reporters know: it's not a horse race, and it's not a replay of Watergate.</description>

			<description>BTW there is precedent for turning off Repubs on CNN and MSNBC. They went through this in Ukraine. They thought they could be fair and balanced, that just let trolls keep an attack vector. Ultimately you have to close it. Journalism will do some growing up before that.</description>

			<description>When I was a kid I participated in several &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rallies_and_protest_marches_in_Washington,_D.C.#1950%E2%80%931999&quot;&gt;marches&lt;/a&gt; on Washington. We took buses from NYC. On one of them, I was part of the organizing committee, I was the political guy on the trip, even though I was just 16. One of the passengers, the mother of a high school friend, said I should get up and give a peptalk and lead a discussion on behalf of the organizers. I gave the talk, it wasn't very good, but I remembered the idea. Any good protest needs organizers. When I turn on MSNBC in the evening I keep hoping they'll cross the line, and start helping us, instead of being with us in desperation waiting for someone to help us. They have the pulput. Putin has Trump. Who does Putin's American opposition have? Someone with courage, a spine, and a sense that it is his or her destiny to lead us out of the wilderness.</description>

			<description>Watched a bit of the Sunday news, and listened to NPR. Lots of Republican lies. Enough with the news that gives more than half the time to lies to keep less than half the population in line. We're deep in a hole, and need a landslide in next year's election to have any hope of turning things around. The press as usual has a bias toward keeping everything disorganized because that gives them the horse race, one of two stories they know how to cover. (The other is Watergate.)</description>

It would be a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy&quot;&gt;Idiocracy&lt;/a&gt;. This movie would anticipate the future of the species when the evolution we're currently going through has run its course.</description>

			<title>What is Digital Ocean?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At a dinner last night with local friends, a question came up -- What is Digital Ocean? I &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22digital+ocean%22&amp;t=hz&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;mention them&lt;/a&gt; in my posts and the nightly email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I realllly like that people read my blog even if they don't know what everything means. This is one of the big &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22ignore+what+you+don%27t+understand%22&amp;t=hz&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;principles&lt;/a&gt; of the net -- ignore what you don't understand. But read it anyway, over time unfamiliar ideas do sink in. I was tired and too much under the influence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/29/214440.html&quot;&gt;White Russians&lt;/a&gt; last night to attempt the answer. I'll try now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of Digital Ocean as a giant warehouse of personal computers. You can rent one of the computers for about $20 a month, and put software on the computer, even stuff that I write myself. This is a big deal because the ability to run software &quot;in the cloud&quot; used to be something only employees of big companies could do. Now anyone can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Unlike my house in the woods their computers are less likely to lose power or their net connection. Also their warehouse is in a place where your computers, and your phone, can access it. I don't want thousands of people connecting to the computers in my house. It's a security thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I pay them money and they run the server for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as you might imagine, the cost goes down and the power goes up. A lot. They have competition, so that helps keep the price down and performance up. I like Digital Ocean because their software and docs are good, and I just like the company. They are by far &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the biggest company in this space, all the major tech companies compete, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, IBM. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is not an ad. I pay full price for my Digital Ocean servers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They are by far &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the biggest company in this space, all the major tech companies compete, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, IBM." created="Sun, 01 Dec 2019 17:30:41 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/01/172830.html#a173041"/>
