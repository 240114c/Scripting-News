			<description>As a newbie in town, I have basic questions like where to shop for &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1550086702000&quot;&gt;groceries&lt;/a&gt;, ride the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1550336098000&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt;, look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1573313656000&quot;&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml#1551967188000&quot;&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; to fly out of -- really basic stuff.  I usually post the question in the private Facebook group for the town. I keep an &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml?format=opml&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt; of some, not all of the questions and the best advice, &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml&quot;&gt;on this.how&lt;/a&gt;. It's for things that aren't blog posts, stories I want to come back to, edit, refine, add to.</description>

			<description>Did a little prototyping for the &lt;i&gt;tweetsucker&lt;/i&gt; project I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/07.html#a144614&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the other day, and noted that the Twitter API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reneraab/node-twitter-api&quot;&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt; that I use is now marked as not maintained. It still works, but It seems this is something Twitter ought to maintain, or pay someone to maintain. Letting this fall out of sync with the actual API wouldn't be very good.</description>

			<description>I couldn't bring myself to watch the Knicks game last night with the Mavericks with their new star, and former Knick, Kristaps Porzingas, who for a few years was the embodiment of hope for the team. I was sure the Knicks would be blown away. What a surprise to wake up to find out &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/ntilikina-gem-in-win-over-porzingis-could-be-knicks-turning-point/&quot;&gt;the Knicks won&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;I don't think anyone was humiliated, but there's a sadness when you realize how great the team could be now if KP hadn't demanded a trade, had found a way to work with the Knicks.</description>

			<description>Not sure if &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/09/rudyTrumpBloombergClinton.png&quot;&gt;this photo&lt;/a&gt; is real. It's supposed to be a 2008 picture of Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Clinton. The only thing that would make it better is if Jeffrey Epstein were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photobombing&quot;&gt;photobombing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

A cop gets out, starts pumping gas. I say hey are you from NYC? He pauses and shakes his head without looking at me. For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashokan_Reservoir&quot;&gt;reservoir&lt;/a&gt;? I ask. He turns around looks at me and says yes, with the typical NYPD stare. Let me translate. Fuck you if you keep doing that I'm going to kick you in the balls and cuff you.

			<description>I didn’t realize people take the lack of a warning from Google or Firefox as an endorsement. If they do they’re going to be sorry because bad guys can get secure websites too. This is where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;push&lt;/a&gt; to https blows up. The next step, obviously, is to make websites register with Google, and have their changes approved the same way iPhone devs do. Quickly this will mean no criticism of China, and of course Google.</description>

			<description>This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/warren-jokes-at-lgbtq-town-hall/index.html&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; made a &quot;joke&quot; at the expense of people who believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Humor works, for presidents, only when it's self-deprecating. Otherwise you make a choice, you're the president of everyone, including people with unpopular beliefs, or remain a senator or college professor. Further she throws this at men, for some reason, as if men are the ones who think this about marriage, exclusively. Personally I don't care if you do or don't get married. I don't think the government should be involved. But same-sex marriage is a recent thing, and of course there are people who are uncomfortable with it. Probably MAGA sounds right to them. A president of everyone should re-assure them that they have the right to their belief, and can live their lives accordingly, but they can't control other people. Had Warren said that, that way (without the putdowns) I would have cheered.</description>

			<description>I was asked by an old friend what I think about lies in Facebook political ads. &quot;I think pragmatically that Zuck is caught between people who lie about the truth, that in most things there is no such thing as the truth, and all politicians lie, and we accept that, and only an asshole would try to impose rules on FB that they aren't willing to impose on themselves.&quot; I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1191370393745051650&quot;&gt;Twitter poll&lt;/a&gt; that was kind of an editorial.</description>

			<description>I have always despised this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/06/cartoonFullSize.png&quot;&gt;xkcd cartoon&lt;/a&gt;. I understand what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; says, I didn't need a cartoon to explain it. People send you this to remind you that your big mouth could cost you your job, and over time a lot more, as the social mob learned how to cancel people in bigger ways. Is that something to be proud of? That you're so intolerant of other views that your reaction is to punish people for expressing them. I remember when the social mob learned that an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich#Mozilla&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/a&gt; at a tech company had given money to a support a ballot measure that would deny same-sex couples the right to marry. He lost his job. I get it -- you had the right to do it. But that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/04/03/politicsNecessarilyCreatesDivisions.html&quot;&gt;doesn't&lt;/a&gt; make it right. I don't care one way or the other if you agree or disagree. But one of the great traditions of our country, that is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; part of the Constitution, is that we celebrate diversity. We listen, and give other ideas a chance to penetrate our view of the world. We have some flexibility. We could change our mind. As we grow older we strive to learn. So while it's not in the Constitution to listen and respect our differences, imho it is in our DNA.</description>

			<description>I have a bit of time to kill today, and I thought I'd try to get to the bottom of some weird behavior in the JS code for this blog. This item has an attached image that is revealed when you click the wedge next to the item. The second time you expand it, when it's revealed it happens very slowly, and it opens from the top and left, with a scrolling effect that I now find annoying. It doesn't do it the first time. I must have made it do this originally, but I don't remember how, and I can't seem to find the code. I'm going to keep looking. (Update: I was able to turn it off by setting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_slide.asp&quot;&gt;params&lt;/a&gt; to slideUp and slideDown to 0. Still not sure why it was doing it for this data type, and not for others.) &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I think Sherrod Brown or Amy Klobuchar would be good Democratic candidates for president. I listened to today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/podcasts/the-daily/whos-ahead-2020.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the chances of the Demo candidates based on polling the NYT just did. It's not a good picture. They say Biden would win, but the Repubs haven't run a campaign on him yet. They're going to let the Dems tear him to shreds first, which they will. People think this is about policy, it's not. &lt;i&gt;People want to feel like winners. &lt;/i&gt;I wouldn't feel like a winner, of any kind, if my president was Warren, Sanders or Biden. Ugh. Anyway if a Democrat is elected what they'll do will depend totally on the makeup of Congress. The more Repubs are left the more compromise, unless of course Trump is re-elected, then you can forget about who's in Congress, it won't matter. Our Congress will be no more consequential than Russia's. I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/poll-trump-beats-democrats-swing-state-biden-warren-sanders.html&quot;&gt;Chait&lt;/a&gt; that the Dems have been living in a fantasy world. None of the leading candidates will beat Trump, none of them.</description>

			<title>Why impeach asap</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So much discussion in the news about impeachment, and they never talk about the #1 reason to impeach, asap. So here's a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's running the presidency as if he was a monarch. Ignoring the Constitution. And the longer he gets away with it the worse it gets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They should make a song about this. How the president is not a king. We could change the words to the Star Spangled Banner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>As the 2016 election approached, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt; published a series of graphs showing over time the likelihood of Clinton or Trump winning. All through October, as Clinton gained confidence, the two branches of the graph diverged, until &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comey#/media/File:Comey_Letter.jpg&quot;&gt;FBI Director Comey's letter&lt;/a&gt; to Congress. I watched it live and my heart sank. Here we go again. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Hillary%27s+Emails+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt;. That evening, Clinton gave a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?417629-2/hillary-clinton-calls-release-information-email-investigation&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;. Eleven days before the election. Voting is already underway. We understood the damage. And you can see it clearly in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/04/fiveThirtyEightGraph.png&quot;&gt;the graph&lt;/a&gt; on this day in 2016. Yes, Clinton was still twice as likely to win as Trump. But the graph was going the wrong way. And we know how it turned out. So remember, the story that the NY Times invented, promoted with love by the FBI and the rest of journalism, was probably a bigger cause of America's defeat than Cambridge Analyitica and Facebook. But of course the NYT controls the conversation, and is unaccountable, so the blame is focused elsewhere.</description>

			<description>We need a C-SPAN for the web. Not archive.org (which is great). A place where you can put things on the record, so when something notable happens you can be sure this will be the last place to disappear, or to be put behind a paywall.</description>

			<description>It was obvious that the Warriors were going to crumble if not this year next year. Dynasties in the NBA are pretty complete unlike other sports, and the teams on top get bored. Winning it all meant something the first time, maybe a bit the second but after that it gets tired. We saw it happen first with the Miami Heat.</description>

			<title>JsonFeed after two years</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of years later, I've yet to see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsonfeed.org/&quot;&gt;JsonFeed&lt;/a&gt; in the wild. And if such a thing existed, I suspect there would also be an RSS 2.0 version of the same content. In the group where developers discuss it, which I follow, most or all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brentsimmons/JSONFeed/issues&quot;&gt;feature requests&lt;/a&gt; are things that have already been done in RSS or Atom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was, provably, no reason to do this. At this point, is there a language or environment that doesn't have an open source library for reading feeds? It's just one call in my JavaScript code to take a bit of text that's supposed to be a feed and get back a JavaScript structure with the contents. Couldn't be simpler. Yet I don't think many of those libraries include support for this two-year-old format. So you have to do more work to read it. One of the goals of the new format was that it would be less work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And on the writing side, maybe writing JSON is a little easier than writing XML, but again, if 20 years after the advent of RSS, you don't have a toolkit in your environment to write feeds, you should probably do it yourself and share it with other devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally if you were going to invent a new format why not just JSONify an existing feed structure. I did that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/10/rssInJsonForReal.html&quot;&gt;for RSS&lt;/a&gt; in a few minutes. My blog is still &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;available in JSON&lt;/a&gt; as well as XML. No need for debates or feature requests. It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rssjs.org/&quot;&gt;RSS but in JSON&lt;/a&gt;. It Just Works&amp;trade;. Not that anyone uses it, for the reasons mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've known both &lt;a href=&quot;https://manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/&quot;&gt;Brent&lt;/a&gt;, the authors of the format, for many years. Nice people. But this was a mistake. Atom, also, was a mistake. All the energy should have been focused on a standard that would be supported everywhere, &lt;i&gt;as easily as possible. &lt;/i&gt;I did it myself. I had designed a format when RSS came along, from Netscape, and I dropped it in favor of RSS, because one way to do something is better than two no matter how much better the second way is. A hard-won lesson from many times around the loop. Hopefully this is something will not be repeated for RSS at least, in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>To Woodstock readers, a couple of ideas. 1. Eventually imho it would be cool if someone did what I'm doing but focused on the town and county. 2. I'm thinking of hosting a meetup, perhaps in my living room, where we do this face to face. I talk for a few minutes on topics either from the blog (most likely) or other subjects. I have done this before, in California and Boston, it can be really interesting. Kind of a like a book club for something that's ongoing, not finished. Or a book tour that lasts months. Just a couple of ideas, seeds planted for the future. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🌲&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A blogging meta-note. I use my blog-writing as a break from development work. Ideas occur to me while doing other stuff. I use the blog as a notebook to record them. I also use Twitter as a first draft. As I've said before the 280-char limit made Twitter a lot more useful. I have a graphic editing environment for blogging that only runs on a Mac. When an idea occurs to me when I'm away from work, I can use a phone or tablet to record it on Twitter. It's there when I'm back at my Mac. It's a pretty decent editorial system. I sent a DM yesterday to Jack Dorsey asking to work on the integration of Twitter with desktop writing tools (my own in particular of course). I think it's so close toa breakthrough. I can feel it. I've been right about this before, btw. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Changes in our world are happening so fast. I wish more news orgs took this as an opportunity to teach and reinforce American rules of self-governance. (British too, btw.) They matter now. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+jury+duty&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;jury duty&lt;/a&gt;. You'd be amazed at what random Americans can do. We are capable of understanding a lot, with nuance. Look at the rules of any sport, baseball, football, etc. Very complicated. Yet huge numbers of people understand them. And we have a baseline of truth in sports talk. People don't make up averages or rules, yet there's lots of room for subjective opinion. In some countries sports talk does turn violent, but not in the US. Wouldn't be a bad model for a new news org to adopt, up front. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;⌚&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I get it. I tried watching the Nets v Rockets last night. Preferred the Knicks v Celtics. The Knicks are more interesting this year. A mix of young and old. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Barrett&quot;&gt;sensational rookie&lt;/a&gt;. The boring part of the NBA are the corporate players like Kyrie and KD. Mercenaries. Oh we'll occupy the Nets so we can take cheap shots at the Knicks. Wow. Brilliant. No one cares about the Nets. They get their paycheck and they'll move on to humiliate another team next year, until fans get tired of it. Thing is most of the fans already are. Ask Toronto. You know the players must think we don't know it's about teams. We really don't care about them so much. Make good teams and we'll be happy. That's why we like the Celtics, the Bucks, Philly, and guess what the Knicks look okay this year. Someone put some care into creating this team. I think that's what the Knicks have been missing. Someone who cares about them. But the Knicks would've said yes to Kyrie, I'm glad they didn't get the chance.</description>

			<description>By now everyone who’s an actual person on Twitter should get that the extreme opinions there are programmed by software. These imitation people are algorithmic, not human.

			<description>We're erecting a Maginot Line, getting ready to re-fight the Battle of 2016, ignoring that the enemy already controls our capital. We should be &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/02/134152.html&quot;&gt;innovating&lt;/a&gt;, but we're not. We're defending against Nixon with lots of Woodsteins. I have a weird feeling we should let Zuck and Jack do what they want, and &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; them, because our current response is a loser, totally inadequate.</description>

			<title>Innovating in journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You know the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs ad&lt;/a&gt; about how geniuses think differently. He was on to something. There is a big difference between the way innovators think and everyone else. And I think I can finally put the difference in words.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're going to innovate you do it first, and look for funding when you've got something working. You don't wait for anyone's approval, or investors nagging you about when you're going to finish, because if your idea is innovative enough you'll never be able to explain it in words, and you'll learn so much in the process, the idea will sound very different very quickly if it's new enough. People will want to invest when it's up and running. You have to get there first. The innovator goes ahead. The non-innovator doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have several friends who are former journalists who are so driven by what they do they write publicly, even though no one is paying them. What they do is exciting. Their ideas are different and valuable. They get me, their reader, thinking, which imho is the best kind of journalism. They may not know it but they are innovating, and if they keep at it, I think there's a good chance they will have such obvious success that people will want to invest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would invest myself if we could put it together as something investible. By that I mean it has a way to grow. That it's not just investing in a few outside-the-box thinkers, but if it could become a place where such thinkers could start, follow their idea, develop their own following, and inspire other thinkers to do what they do. I wouldn't burden it with advertising. I'd let it run for a while, the way they let software developers run without a business model these days, while they test their ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just thinking out loud here. I am sure there's a new journalism out there, that it's not the journalism that gets so much acclaim, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/12/woodward-bernstein-watergate-donald-trump-era&quot;&gt;reinvention&lt;/a&gt; of Woodward and Bernstein, the two Washington Post innovators who brought down Nixon. We should be way ahead of that by now. We need to be, because the forces opposing democracy, the equivalent of 1974's plumbers, are moving much faster. We're erecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line&quot;&gt;Maginot Lines&lt;/a&gt; now, getting ready to fight the Battle of 2016, ignoring that &lt;i&gt;the enemy already controls our capital. &lt;/i&gt;They've been innovating. We haven't seen the results of their most recent innovations, yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another thing Facebook is good for. A friend  posted a request for a referral to a cardiologist. A far-away friend was quite sick. We figured out that wasn't right, they should call 911 and get to a hospital asap. I don't know what the outcome was, but it might have saved a life.</description>
