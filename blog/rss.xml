			<description>I've been chatting about breakage with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davegandy?lang=en&quot;&gt;Dave Gandy&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/16/DaveGandyVoicemail.m4a&quot;&gt;15-minute voicemailcast&lt;/a&gt; to Dave, with a very small slice of my experience with breakage in tech. Dave is now a member of the No Breakage Club. Up until now I thought I was the only one. They learned the hard way by shipping a version of their product that basically broke everyone. It broke me. Squared the complexity of using FA, which ideally would require zero thought, it should &quot;just work&quot; as it did when I first adopted it in 2013. Now they're putting the pieces back together, and I'm guessing it will work. It doesn't always, sometimes you're stuck forever supporting both versions. At least if you care about your users. Not sure where this will go, but it's nice to have a friend on the frontier. In the cast I talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python#Compatibility&quot;&gt;Python's breakage&lt;/a&gt;, it came with v3.0.</description>

			<description>BTW, as I mention in the cast, the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/concord&quot;&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt;, the one I just released, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/concord/tree/master/libraries&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/a&gt; the latest version of Font Awesome. Since they're now a member of No Breakage Club, he's a friend, and it's worth helping him get the very latest stuff out there.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/15.html#a161619&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a new version of Concord, the outliner core of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. This broke the then-current release, v1.8.6. After a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150#issuecomment-586659712&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by Andy Sylvester, I quickly released v1.8.7, which works with the new Concord. The problem was that the name of the CSS file changed. The result is that the outlines &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/16/funkyScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; pretty horrible. To get the latest version reload the page. If that doesn't get you 1.8.7, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache&quot;&gt;here are tips&lt;/a&gt; for getting the browser to do a full reload.</description>

			<title>Mobilize the electorate, with care</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's great that Bloomberg is spending huge money on good advertising that correctly positions the Dems vs Trump. But it's only half the job. The other half is organizing the electorate so we are always mobilized and ready for action&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My guess is they don't want to mobilize us because it isn't really about &quot;us&quot; -- it's about their power. An electorate that was organized could overthrow whoever it was that organized us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't blame them btw. I experienced this myself. In the early days of the net, I started an open mail list with my customers on it. So they could help each other, and ask questions of us. One of my competitors got the idea that they could join the list and market to our customers. Then they got the idea they could blow up the community by throwing huge flaming turds into the list. Since then I've struggled with how to create collaborative communities that don't have this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that Obama didn't keep the organization going after he got elected meant that the Repubs could stonewall him, and he had no effective way to appeal to the electorate to stand by him, even though a lot of us would have done so happily. His humiliation was ours.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/aFQFB5YpDZE&quot;&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt; went on CNN to plead that they give a shit. It's hard to watch because it was 2004, and it's gotten so much worse since then. Makes you realize that we wouldn't be in this mess if we had journalism instead of this garbage. Also fascinating that everyone thought he was joking, but everything he said was serious. The &quot;news&quot; was and is an emotional release.</description>

			<description>I donâ€™t miss Obama. When I see Obama I think of how we lost the war and he didnâ€™t put up a fight. I think of how he let McConnell terrorize us without trying to organize us. I think history will judge him a failure. PS: This is btw why Biden has no chance.</description>

			<title>President Bloomberg, really a Democrat?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Since writing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/13/145424.html?title=bloombergIsMoreThanACandidateForPresident&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about Bloomberg's campaign I've done some more thinking and reading. The best piece I came across was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/why-democrats-should-not-nominate-bloomberg-sexual-harassment-plutocracy.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; in New York by Eric Levitz. It's a long piece, totally worth reading all the way through, but this was the paragraph that made me stop and think.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The same personal fortune that would free the Democratic Party from cash constraints this fall would also liberate a President Bloomberg from partisan constraints once in office. If the plutocratic president decides to find common ground with a Republican Senate on Social Security cuts, what leverage will the Democratic Party have over 'their' White House?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's a really good question. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I came up with a couple of solutions and a couple of conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Insist that Bloomberg burn his bridges with the Republican Party. Go to Kentucky and campaign against Mitch McConnell, who is up for re-election this year. Campaign with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_McGrath&quot;&gt;Amy McGrath&lt;/a&gt;, his Democratic opponent. Help her with advertising and donate to her campaign. Do the same for all congressional Republicans, with an emphasis on the ones with the most tenure and visibility. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even better, Bloomberg steps back in favor of one of the current Democratic candidates. In other words fulfill the promise he made about funding the Democratic campaign against Trump even if he's not the nominee -- now. Take Bloomberg out of it. I think Klobuchar would be the best choice (more on that later). Now we can be sure the president will be a pure Democrat. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The first conclusion -- who cares. The choice in 2020 is about the end of American rule of law. Who knows what the implications are of that. We've never had a lunatic autocrat or monarch with the economic and military power of the United States. In that context, who cares if it's the end of anything as long as we can vote him out of office in four years. (Also since he contributed to Democrats, he's going to have to work with a Democratic Congress, which as we know can be a good check on a legal presidency.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another conclusion -- imagine a happy ending, and write the history of it, from 20-30 years out. Here's what I would write. 2020 was a pivotal election. The Democratic Party and the remnants of the Republican Party that still believed in the Constitution formed a bond, and elected a transitional president, Michael Bloomberg, a former Republican, technocrat, oligarch. This marginalized the extreme part of the Republican Party that was loyal to Trump. The Democrats won the presidency and Congress with huge margins, enough to codify the norms that Trump violated. After the election, the two groups went their own ways, forming two new parties, one liberal and one conservative, and the country evolved out of the insane partisanship of the 90s, 00s and 10s. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Bloomberg is more than a candidate for president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/michael-bloomberg-democratic-primary/&quot;&gt;Joan Walsh&lt;/a&gt; who I admire for being a listener, a rare thing among pundits, wants Bloomberg on the debate stage. She imagines that his opponents would tear him apart over things he said about racial profiling and red zoning in past decades. So many things to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I heard former Philadelphia mayor &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyy.org/episodes/nutter-stands-by-bloomberg-on-stop-and-frisk-and-the-campaign-trail/&quot;&gt;Michael Nutter&lt;/a&gt;, a contemporary of Bloomberg's as mayor of NYC, on NPR yesterday. He's black. They were trying to get him to say Bloomberg was wrong and bad or whatever, but he wouldn't. He said plainly that the violence problem in his city was with black and Hispanic young men, and it was probably the same in NYC. They were the ones walking around with guns. The cities were desperate to get those guns out of their hands. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Joy Reid, on MSNBC on Tuesday night, who is also black, said that blacks have only ever felt passionately about one candidate, Obama. Otherwise they make pragmatic choices. They want to get rid of Trump. They'll choose Bloomberg if they think he's the best way to do that. That's how I vote too, I try to do it always, pick the candidates who would best do what should or must be done. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;OK so Bloomberg is on the debate stage. Each candidate, except perhaps Sanders, is thinking, if I'm the nominee, I'm going to need his support. They aren't likely to go for the jugular. Think of Bloomberg not just as a candidate, but also as a Democratic Koch or Adelson. If he isn't the nominee the Bloomberg PAC is going to play a big role in Democratic politics. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If Bloomberg were just throwing money at this it wouldn't work. But it is working. He thinks creatively, is willing to risk not just his money but his reputation and legacy. &lt;i&gt;He's doing the marketing that the Democrats have failed to do for generations.&lt;/i&gt; He is so smart, most billionaires want to hold on to their money, which is ridiculous, given how short life is and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marknyt/status/1228019691886608384&quot;&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; they are. He's using his money for good, now -- and that imho overshadows every past sin he has been accused of and is likely to be accused of. It doesn't eliminate them, but they have to be considered against the good he is doing, which imho is enormous. He's a gift horse and go ahead and look if you must, but he should keep going in the meantime. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A creative idea. Bloomberg could offer say $50 million to any still-running candidate, to be used for advertising to position against Trump, now, no strings attached. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg is not just a candidate. He's doing the marketing, actually just starting to, that the Democrats have failed to do, ever. All the while the Republicans have mastered it. The Democrats are so unaware of this, they don't even see it. So when they look at Bloomberg they only see what they know to look for. A horse in a race. But he's a developer, working on defining media and politics for the world of 2020. He's going to test every assumption we have about how campaigns work, and that itself will be incredibly valuable. Let's pay close attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's also working in advance of Trump, who hasn't yet managed to shut off political advertising of his opponents. This door should be shoved wide open in the most captivating way possible so when and if he shuts it down, people will miss it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Steve Jobs came along he looked at computers differently from the way IBM did. He looked for assumptions that could be broken and the result was the Apple II. When we got blogging and podcasting going, again we looked for assumptions of print journalism and radio that could be broken and it worked. We haven't yet done that for politics. Not just money-raising, that was solved in 2004 by Howard Dean and Joe Trippi. Actually doing politics effectively without being controlled by trolls using the networking technology of today. Bloomberg, a master of tech and media, is probably the best person in the world to try to do this right now. That's what journalism is, predictably, missing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was Bartlet for America, which begat Dean for America, now we need to be more specific -- politics for the rest of us. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/14/141155.html?title=presidentBloombergReallyADemocrat&quot;&gt;President Bloomberg, really a Democrat?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/154&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I have a JavaScript app running in the browser. I want it to quit when another copy of the same app is opened in another tab. I used to do this with a localStorage value. Set it to a random string of 25 characters. Periodically compare the string in localStorage with the one I set at startup. If it's different I know another copy of the app is running, and I (used to) exit via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_close.asp&quot;&gt;window.close&lt;/a&gt;. This no longer works. There's an error from the browser, &quot;Scripts may close only the windows that were opened by it.&quot; So is there no way for an app to quit on its own without a user interaction?</description>

			<title>Disengage?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It may be time to disengage from the daily news a la Maddow et al. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they're plucking the strings when they're ready to, not when the news is happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it's malice, but there are certainly things happening we can't see that they don't talk about publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find I wish I could ask my grandparents what they did when their societies were going through this kind of transition. Stalin, Hitler, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yup this is depressing, but while this is going on, it's still the same planet and climate, more or less, as it was last year this time. And I'm feeling good so that's something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Life is a challenge. It ain't over till it's over. Namaste y'all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>NYC is fine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/opinion/commentary/bloomberg-killed-new-york-citys-soul.html&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; that former NYC mayor Bloomberg killed NYC's soul. As a son of New York, born and raised there, and who recently spent nine years living there, this is a perennial story, told many times every generation, and so far, it has never been true. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They said it when my family came to the city in the 1940s. Refugees from Europe will destroy the soul of the city. I don't think so. We were just added to the melting pot. Before that it was the Irish, Italians, African Americans, Hispanics, every race, religion, you name it, they've all been accused of destroying the city.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now they're replacing the great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poetspath.com/napalm/_special_edition_nhs_2013/Newman1.htm&quot;&gt;delis&lt;/a&gt;, diners and bodegas with &lt;a href=&quot;https://locator.chase.com/&quot;&gt;ATM farms&lt;/a&gt;, the soul of the city is being destroyed they say, I agree, but read on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I assume that Bloomberg did incentivize the obscene construction of residential skyscrapers in Manhattan, esp on the southern edge of Central Park, blocking out sunlight, to provide excellent views to Russian oligarchs and Saudi oil princes who are never there. But at the same time, Queens, the borough that raised me, that was a sleepy boring white bread place when I was growing up, has become the melting pot Manhattan used to be. People actually go to Flushing to eat the best Asian food in the city. If you had told me that when I was growing up there, I would have said it'll never happen. Flushing is an embarassment. It has a creek that smells like a sewer. And for crying out loud it's named Flushing. Geez. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The city is complex, huge, impossible to control. It's possible that some things Bloomberg did to the city may have lasting negative consequences, but he also made some things better. My favorite Bloomberg accomplishment were the bike lanes. I must have ridden five thousand miles in the city in the last decade. It's an excellent city for biking, but who would have thought that? Not me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Our Banana Republic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What's going on with the DoJ is serious, the news has captured that, but the reporting misses a few important things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why we don't want justice to be partisan. The reports assume people understand, but I think a lot of people may not put two and two together. If justice is applied not based on evidence but on whether you're in favor with the president, the inverse will happen too, people are prosecuted because they're enemies of the president. Expect Comey to be arrested soon, and perhaps Schiff, Pelosi, Romney and others who have crossed Trump in more powerful ways that poor Colonel Vindman. You may say, oh well, the president is just one person, how much damage can he do, but he is the top person, and people below will look for signals and will inevitably try please him. You end up with justice being bought and paid for in favors to the top guy and his capos. A government not of laws, but of organized crime. However cynical you may be about justice in the US, the system we've lived with has rules that limit abuse, but those rules appear to be slipping away now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This isn't the first time &quot;crony justice&quot; has happened in the last few months, or even the biggest travesty. Recall that the DoJ refused to investigate the accusations of the Ukraine whistleblower that led to Trump's impeachment. So the House had to do its own investigating. The congressional Republicans made an issue of how the Democrats did the investigating, but the press for the most part overlooked that they shouldn't have had to do the investigating in the first place. That's why we have a DoJ. When the government is properly functioning it would have been routine, but Barr is acting as the president's attorney, not the US's attorney, therefore of course he didn't investigate.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The various departments may report to the president but they work for Congress as much as they do the president. No longer true. That's why the second article of impeachment, the one Romney didn't vote for, was so important. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also while it's honorable for a DoJ lawyer to resign a case, or resign from the department, and something we should applaud (as opposed to standing by and accepting the malpractice), also note that it serves Barr's purposes to get rid of the ethical people who remain, and once gone they can no longer sound the alarm. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>New site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://isrssdead.com/&quot;&gt;IsRSSDead.com&lt;/a&gt;. I saw a similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://israilsdead.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; for Ruby on Rails, and immediately wanted one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. The first text on the page was rude because I think it's a rude question. The next answer was sarcastic. And now there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/11/isRssDead.png&quot;&gt;polite answer&lt;/a&gt;. It's given me a lot of ideas. I think I might put a reverse chronologic list of news sites that have updated recently. The list of news orgs that support RSS is impressive. Any news syndication standard would be happy with such support. And maybe list some of the software devs who have invested in RSS, and who continue to do so. Standards aren't alive or dead, but as long as people persist in blaming RSS for their problems, we should probably accept the challenge. And thanks to the Rails folks for the idea. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CharlesPPierce/status/1226855965959639040&quot;&gt;Charles Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, a columnist at Esquire, asks why suddenly James Carville is relevant (again). This my friends is exactly what's wrong with journalism and politics. Carville isn't any more or less relevant now. He did however do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/-wake-up-dem-vet-calls-for-party-to-be-more-relevant-diverse-after-iowa-chaos-78129221946&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC where he said exactly what the Democrats are doing to lose the election, and correctly stated what the election is about and what the consequences would be of losing. It was a passionate wakeup call that apparently rippled out to Pierce's perch in the hierarchy of punditry, who hears it as the question he asks. Why is Carville relevant, he asks. Better question, why is Pierce such an idiot? It doesn't matter who sees the truth and yells it loud enough to pierce the fog of your self-importance, what matters is that &lt;i&gt;it's the truth. &lt;/i&gt;We are, as Carville says, on our way to electing Trump to another term, when what we need to do is win so decisively that we have the power to undo the damage he did. We need to be very smart, focused and not worry about Pierce's pecking order. Yet our pundits and political leaders are mostly just worried about doing what they always do, being well paid and as Pierce puts it, relevant.</description>

Once you do that, it makes sense to look for tools to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/&quot;&gt;augment&lt;/a&gt; that. I'm going to let Doc tell you the rest.

			<description>Someone should write a piece about how much worse it's going to be with Trump than the press is willing to admit.

			<description>I did a small overhaul of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; code yesterday. Screwing with that code is inherently dangerous, make a mistake and the wrong email goes out to all the subscribers. Or it doesn't go out at all. This kind of code is notoriously hard to test. Anyway it worked. Whew. And one of the side-effects is that the emails go out at 12:00 PM, not 12:02 PM. I know just a two-minute difference, but I'm a perfectionist, and the two minutes really bothered me. Also it's more reliable, which is the real reason I did the work.</description>

			<description>Doc asked in passing what it means when a section of the outline has chevrons in place of the wedges. In this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/08/commentExample.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; the red arrow points to a comment. It means the text is commented. You toggle the feature with Cmd-\. Like everything in an outline, it's hierarchic, so when you comment a headline, it and all its subs are commented. Okay so now what does it mean to be commented? It depends on who processes the outline. The idea originated in programming, when you want to explain a bit of code, you'd tell the code interpreter the writing by &quot;commenting it out.&quot; Comments are like speaker notes for code. That was the long answer. The short one is that, for what you're doing now, it probably doesn't matter if some text is commented or not. It'll happen if you press Cmd-\ by accident.</description>

			<description>I turned off the &lt;a href=&quot;http://likes.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Likes feature&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News. Most people are reading the stuff through email and RSS. Likes predates the email distribution. The server is a bit of a hog. But the most important thing was that it wasn't being used. If it had gained traction I would have been ready to do the work to get it smoothed out. The code is still there, the server is still running, so I could turn it back on any time.</description>

It was hard to focus on it when I wasn't getting any feedback. I can't emphasize enough how important it is for me to have a connection with smart enthusiastic users.</description>

			<description>BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; is just another name for &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;. There was a previous version that was quite different. So when the second version was on the way, I called it LO2. Also because typing &lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing: 0.04em&quot;&gt;LITTLE OUTLINER&lt;/span&gt; was more work than LO2. Sorry for the confusion.</description>

			<description>It's a two voicemailcast Friday. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/05/daveToDoc2.m4a&quot;&gt;The first one&lt;/a&gt; is from me, to kick it off, and a response from Doc will follow in the next item. I have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/g4&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt;, but they were the notes I took before doing the podcast, I didn't clean them up, so you're seeing D2D (Dave-to-Dave) communication. I recorded this on Wednesday. And some of the items in the outline didn't make it into the cast. Still diggin.</description>
