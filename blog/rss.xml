It was a good vision.</description>

			<description>Over the decades I've spun out a number of individual developers from teams I lead. That started when I sold Living Videotext to Symantec in 1987. I left the company a few months after the deal closed. I wasn't smart or patient enough to try to fit into someone else's company, and I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; I really wanted to do. Here's the interesting thing. When I called back the developers I had left behind, and asked if they would collaborate on interop with my new product, they told me how they work for a big company now and can't collaborate with someone like me. Heh. I knew that they were working on a project with Apple called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock_(framework)&quot;&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, it happens all the time. Once they or I leave the nest, they don't see the value of continuing the collaboration. You'd think, schooled in the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;, they'd want to go forth in the world and create more interop, but big companies are a big influence on the people who work there. Even relatively small companies (like Symantec in the 80s) have a lot of inward pull.</description>

			<description>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterfurnace.com/literature/premier/sp1555.pdf&quot;&gt;geothermal&lt;/a&gt; heating and cooling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waterfurnace.com/&quot;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt; that works well, is supposed to be efficient (I haven't used it enough to verify) but there is one thing that sucks about it. When it turns on there's a huge slamming sound. Like a garage door. You can't sleep through it. It's jarring even when you're awake. I get mixed opinions. Some say the loud sound is just the way it works, and others say it's wrong, they have used geothermal systems that worked just like any other forced air heating or cooling system. Anyway I have the problem solved for now, at least in October. I don't turn the heat on. I use a space heater at night, and keep the bedroom door closed. But we haven't had a frost yet. Then I'll &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/winter-storm/frozen-pipes.html&quot;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; another answer.</description>

			<title>On this day in 1986</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ujwjqIldwU&quot;&gt;Game 6&lt;/a&gt; of the 1986 World Series at my brother's apartment in Palo Alto, with our father.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the moment the ball went through Buckner's legs, I remember vividly my father rolling around on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the one time in a lifetime I saw my father let go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I feel sorry for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Engel&quot;&gt;Richard Engel&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/trump-withdrawal-of-u-s-troops-makes-putin-the-kingmaker-in-syria-71871557542&quot;&gt;reporting from Syria&lt;/a&gt; raises a question that his colleagues in the US don't want to discuss. Russia moving in to take over from the US is no accident, it was the plan. In America for some reason they don't want to incorporate the obvious fact that Trump works for Russia, not for the United States. Over and over, for years, they pretend they don't know this. Why?</description>

			<description>Reporting on the demonstration put on by Republican House members yesterday, CNN repeated the claim that Repubs were being denied entry to the Shiff hearings. This is why the Repubs do these stunts, because journalism doesn't report the news in a realistic way. The technically correct lead-in would be: &lt;i&gt;Repubs put on a dishonest demo, trying to attract naive press coverage.&lt;/i&gt; Now would be a good time to change the game with Repubs, because they don't have a choice but to accept reasonable rules re lies.</description>

			<description>I'm glad to hear that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1187374005906542592&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; has qualified for the next Democratic debate. I want a candidate that everyone can get behind and that includes Republicans and former Obama voters who voted for Trump. We need a president who wins in a landslide, takes both houses, and someone who knows how to get things done in our political system. When we've elected &quot;outsiders&quot; the results have never been good for us. But Klobuchar's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1187478894045257731&quot;&gt;confidence&lt;/a&gt; isn't there yet. Warren has it, as does Sanders, but neither has the ability to govern with the full support of most Americans. We have to think clearly about how our political system will work after Trump.</description>

			<description>We need a Wikipedia for news. A landing page for each story, with a summary, and pointer to coverage of all major news sites. As they all adopt paywalls I find it's hard to pick a good story to point to from pieces on my blog. Also I don't like pointing to news pages that are overloaded with crapware. Two bits of prior art. &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/&quot;&gt;Political Wire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt;. I like Political Wire's synopses, and Memeorandum's accumulation of links and tweets. Merge those two ideas, and cover more than politics, that's the basic idea. And also use relatively future-safe server tech.</description>

As they all adopt paywalls I find it's hard to pick a good story to point to from pieces on my blog. Also I don't like pointing to news pages that are overloaded with crapware. Two bits of prior art. &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/&quot;&gt;Political Wire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt;. I like Political Wire's synopses, and Memeorandum's accumulation of links and tweets. Merge those two ideas, and cover more than politics, that's the basic idea. And also use relatively future-safe server tech." created="Wed, 23 Oct 2019 13:29:02 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/14/mlk.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/10/23.html#a132902"/>

			<description>We're having the fight to preserve the Constitution and rule of law, right now, today. It's debatable the extent to which the president is above the law, but certainly no one else is.

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/19/173340.html&quot;&gt;Dropbox situation&lt;/a&gt; has become more dire. I pretty much have to stop everything and reconceive how I work with my servers from my desktop. Something broke. I may have a workaround. The lesson is that when you depend on other people's tech, at some point it will fail, and then what will you do. It's hard to have a plan for this kind of outage.</description>

			<description>One of the best purchases I've ever made -- a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FXN3E74/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Brita water pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. It fits perfectly in the door of a refrigerator. Fill the top with water, put the pitcher in the fridge. It takes a few minutes to filter the water.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A permanent citizen's occupation of DC. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We don't leave until Trump does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You sign up for one full day of your choosing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's room for say 100K people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once 100K people have committed for a given day, that's it, the day is full. You have to sign up for another day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You arrange to get yourself to DC and back home. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Carry a sign or wear a button or clothing that says you're there to demand Trump's impeachment and removal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Go anywhere in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/The+White+House,+1600+Pennsylvania+Ave+NW,+Washington,+DC+20500/United+States+Capitol,+First+St+SE,+Washington,+DC+20004/@38.894289,-77.0315506,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b7bcdecbb1df:0x715969d86d0b76bf!2m2!1d-77.0365298!2d38.8976763!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b82921a2cf17:0x482a3f7c10cf8c4!2m2!1d-77.0090505!2d38.8899389!3e2&quot;&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; between the Capitol and the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Flood the zone.

			<title>Too many remotes, still</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This started out being a review of the new Apple TV but the real story is same as it ever was, the living room networking situation is still a mess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/20/tooManyRemotes.png&quot;&gt;too many remotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This tale started when the Spectrum app for Roku broke, I could no longer access my favorites. That meant every time I wanted to find a program, I had to fish through all the channels. I've learned over the years which channels I need, basically MSNBC, CNN, HBO, Showtime, the stations that have Law &amp; Order, channels that carry the sports teams I follow. I imagine it's pretty similar for other people. After all these years you develop paths, and program the system accordingly. At this point, I'm not willing to use Spectrum without favorites. But I have been, and it's unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their support is also ridiculous. They want you to jump through the same set of hoops every time no matter what the problem is. I do what they ask, even though I have a theory about what happened. I'm pretty sure they broke something in an upgrade. I can tell I'm using a new version, they made little UI changes, at the same time Favorites stopped working. That's an Occam's Razor type thing. More evidence -- my Favorites are still there on my iPhone, iPad and in the new Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to why I was interested in Apple TV in the first place. I thought perhaps I could just use Apple TV to access Spectrum, working around the breakage. $199 is a lot of money to spend to do that, but I had an extra HDMI port open on my TV, and I wanted to see what's new there, so why not. I had an old Apple TV, btw -- but the Spectrum app wasn't available for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I've spent a few days with Apple TV, trying to fit it into my routine. But it's not a good fit for mostly UI reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to use their remote. The Roku remote, which to me is the most natural, doesn't work with Apple TV. The Apple remote is innovative. Now I see why they were making a big deal about track pads. But it's slow and error-prone, compared to clicking the arrows on the Roku remote. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But there's the problem now of having two remotes. One of my rules for design is &quot;One way is better than two, no matter how much better the second is.&quot; I bet Apple can prove that their remote is better. But on Rokui I think they should just use the Roku remote. I remember when I first shipped Mac software in 1984, I wanted to design my own (better) user interface. After a year or so we gave up on that and just used the Mac standard interface, even though it wasn't good for what we were doing. The pressure not to make people master a second UI was too great. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And there's a third way -- the Mac mouse and keyboard to control Mac Mini, that I've had hooked into my living room TV for 15 years or so. In the old days it was very useful. These days, I prefer to use the streaming services. I use the Mac for demos, and to show videos of my own, though I could use the Apple TV for that. Honestly I don't know why I have a Mac under my TV these days, but I do.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The net-net is that the Apple TV will not get a lot of use. It doesn't have anything over Roku, and they make me put down the Roku remote and pick up theirs. The Apple remote is weird, it doesn't work the way I feel it should. I'm sure they think I'm wrong, but I remember that I'm the customer, and there's an adage that goes with that too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dropbox not working (for me)</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the time Dropbox works, but today, sometime just after 11AM Eastern, it got flaky and basically stopped working. Usually it's something I did, so I started checking things out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have two accounts, neither is close to out of space. One is using 178.85 GB of 2.1 TB. The other is using 11.68 GB of 2 TB.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I thought perhaps my desktop computer wasn't synching. I tried creating a folder, and it took a very long time for it to show up in the dropbox.com file browser, but it did eventually show up. But it does not show up on the server it's intended for.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My desktop computer says it's been synching for a couple of hours. That's when I started looking. Maybe it was going on a lot longer. I don't know. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The way I first experienced the outage is that updates to the app I'm working on stopped appearing on the server. Before that I was making changes, and they'd take the usual amount of time, a few seconds, to appear on the server.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I checked their &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;, and it says everything is good. I looked at the Dropbox support &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DropboxSupport&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, it says it's closed until Monday.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm kind of stuck. No idea what the problem is. Is it my problem? How can I tell. It doesn't seem like it, because if it were, all my desktop computers and servers would have to be experiencing the same problem. It could happen. But it doesn't seem likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Git-based code sync</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/145319.html&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; about using git for code distribution. This was a new idea for me. In the past I've done it lots of different ways.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/about.html&quot;&gt;Fat pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS feeds, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+codecasting&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;aka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/02/16/whatIsCodecasting.html&quot;&gt;codecasting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One-way sync with an S3 location.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They all work well and scale since they're static. I did one method that wasn't static, using XML-RPC. That method had problems as the installed base of Frontier grew. Static distribution is the way to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I waited for a response to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/145319.html&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; about folder-level sync with a git repository, I went ahead with the brute force method, which works as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When it's time to sync, first we clone the whole repo into a temp folder. Then compare the destination folder with the sub-folder of the downloaded repo, copy the new or changed files. Then delete the temporary repo.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The assumption is that the repo is relatively small. We burn a bit of bandwidth and temporary disk space. And the job gets done. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The overall system I'm working on will also support one-way sync with an S3 location and perhaps RSS-based delivery later. But right now having git-based distribution working, I can proceed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Breaking Bad finale</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As with previous installments, this contains spoilers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched the last two episodes of Breaking Bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I had only watched them once, when they first came out, but I remembered almost all of it. And it's amazing that so much happens in the last episode.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First I want to say that my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/171521.html&quot;&gt;previous report&lt;/a&gt; is one of the sloppiest bits of writing and editing I've ever done. It's practically incoherent. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point was this, even though I hate Walter White, his humanity comes through, and his broken heart. Even more so in the finale. No one wants his money. His son wants him to die. He admits now he wasn't doing it for his family, he was doing it because he's good at making meth and being a crime boss, and he likes it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the end he forgives Jesse. And he spends his last moments in Jesse's meth lab, and he's happy in the only way Walter White, having passed on the family business, ever was happy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Was it a great show? Yes. No reservations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got started on this exploration by watching the Breaking Bad movie that just came out. I was wondering if there was anything they could have done with two hours that would be respectful of the show. I haven't figured that out. I'll let you know if I do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Would Brooks vote for Warren?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I always wonder why people disclaim that they don't like me before they point to something I've written as being relevant or important. So I won't tell you what I think of David Brooks. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/trump-warren-2020.html&quot;&gt;His column&lt;/a&gt; in today's NYT is worth reading. He asks if it's Trump v Warren, who he, a moderate Republican, will vote for. I'll save you the suspense, it's Warren. Good, Brooks has a soul and isn't an idiot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Four years of Warren, who imho likely will be as ineffective a president as Jimmy Carter, is way better than four years of the accelerated lunacy of Trump. The United States, seriously, would not survive that. I don't think we'll survive another 1.5 years, which is why impeachment and removal is an urgent matter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He says &quot;If the party nominated one of those six, you really could see the Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence. You could see movement on a range of issues where large majorities are already stacked on one side: guns, climate change, reducing income inequality, expanding health coverage.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I agree. A lot of change would be possible with a centrist Democrat in the presidency, they might even be possible with Warren. I like the progressive ideas, and I think our chance of progress is better if we elect a moderate in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_goes_to_China&quot;&gt;Nixon going to China&lt;/a&gt;, something worth considering, a moderate Democrat could be more effectively progressive than Warren. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Breaking Bad report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As with previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/16/192128.html&quot;&gt;installments&lt;/a&gt;, this contains spoilers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/breaking-bad-5-shocking-quotes-629629&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias_(Breaking_Bad)&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; where Hank dies. A very pivotal scene. Walt loses his money to the Nazis, of course Hank dies as does his friend Gomez. Walter White comes unglued. All logic says, based on previous Walter White choices, that Hank must die. The Nazi, Jack, knows it, Hank knows it. Hank, after hearing Walter offer the Jack $80 million to let Hank live, must have been touched, because his final words were: &quot;You want me to beg? You're the smartest guy I ever met, and you're too stupid to see -- he made up his mind 10 minutes ago.&quot; It's a beautiful scene. And of course none of the events taking place wouldn't have happened if Walter weren't so blinded by his obsession with money, and his feelings about Jesse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still hate Walter White, I guess I never doubted the depth of his character, he has a heart, and it's breaking now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Using git for code distribution</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a project using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steveukx/git-js#readme&quot;&gt;simple-git&lt;/a&gt; in Node, and have what I think should be a simple application, not sure how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a local called myAppFolder containing the source for an application. Various JavaScript files, a package.json, folders for user data and stats. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A location on GitHub, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/test2&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; called test2 with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/test2/tree/master/helloworld&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; whose path is helloworld/ that is meant to have the most up to date version of the files from the location on GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a one-way sync, from the server to the local folder. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/397be0cf030bc3709eb73f3deb6f5912&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; that clones the repo, but that gets a copy of everything in the repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just need to keep up to date with one folder. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Any help much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I opened this as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/issues/403&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; on the simple-get repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday was the 50th anniversary of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_World_Series&quot;&gt;1969 Mets World Series&lt;/a&gt; win. I was 14.

Loved them when they lost, was rewarded for the trust. I’ve believed in miracles my whole life thanks to the example of the 1969 Mets.</description>

			<description>In 1995 I wrote a piece entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#3&quot;&gt;The Baseball God&lt;/a&gt;. It was about two days. 1. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_World_Series#Game_5&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; the Mets won the World Series in 1969. 2. And the day of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake&quot;&gt;Loma Prieta quake&lt;/a&gt;, when the Giants were playing the A's in the World Series in San Francisco. I only realize now, 24 years later, that they were just one day apart, October 17 in 1989, and October 16 in 1969 (I'm writing this on October 17, 2019). Is the Baseball God sending us a message?</description>
