			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Stengel&quot;&gt;Casey Stengel&lt;/a&gt; is credited with asking about the lovably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_New_York_Mets_season&quot;&gt;awful&lt;/a&gt; 1962 Mets: &quot;Can't anybody here play this game?&quot; He might have been talking about the management of the 2019 Knicks. They have lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/&quot;&gt;cap space&lt;/a&gt;, the profits from giving up on Kristaps Porzingas, which was sad (and it turns out delusional), but it's also power, even if they didn't get KD or Kawhi --  and &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; they're &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TommyBeer/status/1145705086871625733&quot;&gt;pissing&lt;/a&gt; it away. We need this team to be sold. Please anyone, my friend's cat even, could run this team better.</description>
