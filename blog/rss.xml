			<description>I got the new &lt;a href=&quot;#a150254&quot;&gt;monitor&lt;/a&gt;. It's bigger than the old one. Bright. But interestingly nowhere near as nice as the Mac. I guess all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac-pro&quot;&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; that buys you something. ðŸ¤ </description>

			<description>Why are we surprised when &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=president+pussy+grabber&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;President Pussy Grabber&lt;/a&gt; makes the border the issue. Boundaries are his playground. He likes to violate them. Do you think once the troops are on the border, they might go into Mexico?</description>

			<description>I checked in with a friend from Berkeley yesterday about stuff I had been writing here. I felt yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/30/174911.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Lakoff, family and framing was kind of a breakthrough. Lakoff's strict father vs nuturing mother, along with my recent realization that we as a society exist in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/29/001342.html&quot;&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt; of abuse. She said something other people have said, she didn't come from an abusive family. I accept that. It's still true that abuse is the context of our lives. It's hidden. Kids are taught to cover for their parents. Yet abuse is viewed, in our discourse, as exceptional. Something that can be fixed by punishing a few people. It's not going to be that easy. Just look at how our political system has embraced not just a strict father, but an abusive one. People voted for him. Not because they're any of the things people say they are. They voted for him because he is, to them, comfortable and trustworthy. Now look at that and tell me abuse isn't the context we live in. It's meant to be a mathematical statement, btw. Not that we chose it, or deserve it. It is what it is.</description>

			<description>24 hours later and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/31.html#a170639&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; still has over &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/01/dropbox.png&quot;&gt;1.5 million files&lt;/a&gt; to download. Files I already have here in my old Dropbox folder. Yesterday at this time it had 1.6 million files left.

			<description>I finally found something to buy that I'm genuinely excited about. I keep a second monitor to the left of my main screen. I think of it as a rear-view-mirror in a car. It's where I keep the status readouts, hit counters, server monitors, etc. I watch TV on that monitor (via Spectrum's website). Anyway, the monitor has, until now, been an old Apple screen from 2006 or so. I had bought it to go with my old Mac Pro. That old monitor can't plug into my new iMac Pro. So then I thought, let's buy a new one. Of course monitors have gotten a lot better and cheaper since 2006. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IZBIMLK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;new one&lt;/a&gt; is going to be glorious, or so I think. Should arrive later today via Amazon. Watch this &lt;a href=&quot;#a165259&quot;&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>In April, I set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://newriver5.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;demo river&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting development system for people getting started in Node. They don't charge to run your application, but if it isn't accessed frequently they put it to sleep, and wake it up next time it's accessed. Just for fun I tried installing River5. It works! And even better, here we are six months later, and the app is still running, and doing a great job of getting the news. I would have thoughth it would have to do a scan for new news when I accessed it, but it's been reading news all night. There must be other people using it? Not sure. But it's good. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>An example of framing. People who are anti-abortion say they're &quot;pro-life.&quot; If you're pro-choice you could deny them their framing and call them anti-abortion.

			<description>Apple has finally made moving to a new machine as effortless as it can be, without having everything be in the cloud. Now Dropbox has to figure this out too. My Dropbox folder is where it used to be but it doesn't recognize it on the new system. Perhaps because the name of the boot drive changed? Not sure. But I have a huge Dropbox, with systems built in it that have been running for years. Not happy that I have to re-download every file, when they're all already on the system. It's going to take at least 24 hours based on past experience.</description>

			<title>The Moneyball of politics</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff&quot;&gt;George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt; was on MSNBC last night, along with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=affable&quot;&gt;affable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kristol&quot;&gt;Republican pundit&lt;/a&gt;, to talk about his ideas of how politics works. Lakoff's view is as far as I'm concerned exactly right. Republicans represent the strict father, and Democrats the nuturing mother. When you vote Republican it's probably because in the house you grew up in the father was a strong figure and the mother not. If you vote Democratic, you're seeking the mother, because that's what you trust. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Repubs know about this, and play into it, and the Dems think we make voting decisions based on policy. That isn't the observed behavior. If you ever doubted it, Trump is the proof. He says whatever he wants. People don't care. It's who he is and how confident he is that makes them feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lakoff also talks about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/jul/20/the-power-of-framing-its-not-what-you-say-its-how-you-say-it&quot;&gt;framing&lt;/a&gt;. It matters how you present an idea more than what the idea actually is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act&quot;&gt;Partial birth abortion&lt;/a&gt;, for example, sounds horrible. But if you or a family member needed an abortion to save their life, you'd see it differently. Framing. Lakoff says &quot;Don't think about an elephant&quot; as Trump might say &quot;Don't kill Jews.&quot; When Trump says it, he's putting the idea of You -&gt; Killing -&gt; Jews in your head. He can say he said not to do it. But it's just as effective at planting the idea when negated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example from my own life. Talking with an Apple exec at a tradeshow in the 1990s he said &quot;We're not trying to crush you,&quot; from which I concluded they are trying to crush me. It's the way the mind works. Lakoff sees that clearly, but TV pundits and Democrats don't know this. They really don't. They think facts are how people make up their minds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though he's so brilliant, when Lakoff goes on MSNBC it's a disaster. None of his very important ideas are communicated. He says &quot;Don't think about the elephant,&quot; and leaves it to the listener to figure it out. The other panelist and perhaps the moderator have no idea what he's talking about, and unless you had read his book, or attended a lecture, or listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/02/25/interviewWithGeorgeLakoff.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, you couldn't. No discussion happens, it's a wasted opportunity. I've seen this happen twice now. Frustrating as hell. Because it's hard to explain how fucked up a system is within the system itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think these ideas are as powerful as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt; was to baseball when they were discovered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2011/11/michael-lewis-and-billy-beane-talk-moneyball.html&quot;&gt;Billy Beane&lt;/a&gt; of the Oakland As. Since then it's been practiced by football, basketball, and other baseball teams with much success. Moneyball says you should look at what factors make a difference in winning, and do that. An inexpensive hitter who reliably gets on base, even by walking, is more central to winning than an expensive high percentage hitter. You look at the numbers and do what they say to do. The As, a poor team, couldn't afford to buy the great players, so instead they bought players that made them win. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lakoff is the equivalent of Moneyball, but applied to politics. Lakoff's laws are observable. Hillary didn't lose because she had bad ideas, quite the opposite, she had smart ones, based on decades of experience in government, and a genius mind. She just didn't know if she was a nurturing mother or a strict father. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think we're going to dig out of this until the leadership and the marketing people in the Democratic Party learn about Lakoff's family and framing. A book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis&quot;&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/a&gt; would be hugely impactful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: We will eventually sort it out, I think, if we survive Trump. The next generation of leaders in the Democratic Party are really something. I'm thinking of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams&quot;&gt;Stacey Abrams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gillum&quot;&gt;Andrew Gillum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beto_O%27Rourke&quot;&gt;Beto O'Rourke&lt;/a&gt;.

				<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff&quot;&gt;George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt; was on MSNBC last night, along with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=affable&quot;&gt;affable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kristol&quot;&gt;Republican pundit&lt;/a&gt;, to talk about his ideas of how politics works. Lakoff's view is as far as I'm concerned exactly right. Republicans represent the strict father, and Democrats the nuturing mother. When you vote Republican it's probably because in the house you grew up in the father was a strong figure and the mother not. If you vote Democratic, you're seeking the mother, because that's what you trust." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:10:39 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/31/moneyball.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html#a171039"/>
				<source:outline text="The Repubs know about this, and play into it, and the Dems think we make voting decisions based on policy. That isn't the observed behavior. If you ever doubted it, Trump is the proof. He says whatever he wants. People don't care. It's who he is and how confident he is that makes them feel comfortable." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:12:53 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html#a171253"/>
				<source:outline text="Lakoff also talks about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/jul/20/the-power-of-framing-its-not-what-you-say-its-how-you-say-it&quot;&gt;framing&lt;/a&gt;. It matters how you present an idea more than what the idea actually is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act&quot;&gt;Partial birth abortion&lt;/a&gt;, for example, sounds horrible. But if you or a family member needed an abortion to save their life, you'd see it differently. Framing. Lakoff says &quot;Don't think about an elephant&quot; as Trump might say &quot;Don't kill Jews.&quot; When Trump says it, he's putting the idea of You -&gt; Killing -&gt; Jews in your head. He can say he said not to do it. But it's just as effective at planting the idea when negated." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:24:36 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html#a172436"/>
				<source:outline text="An example from my own life. Talking with an Apple exec at a tradeshow in the 1990s he said &quot;We're not trying to crush you,&quot; from which I concluded they are trying to crush me. It's the way the mind works. Lakoff sees that clearly, but TV pundits and Democrats don't know this. They really don't. They think facts are how people make up their minds." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:26:45 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html#a172645"/>
				<source:outline text="Even though he's so brilliant, when Lakoff goes on MSNBC it's a disaster. None of his very important ideas are communicated. He says &quot;Don't think about the elephant,&quot; and leaves it to the listener to figure it out. The other panelist and perhaps the moderator have no idea what he's talking about, and unless you had read his book, or attended a lecture, or listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/02/25/interviewWithGeorgeLakoff.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, you couldn't. No discussion happens, it's a wasted opportunity. I've seen this happen twice now. Frustrating as hell. Because it's hard to explain how fucked up a system is within the system itself." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:13:49 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html#a171349"/>
				<source:outline text="I think these ideas are as powerful as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt; was to baseball when they were discovered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/culture/2011/11/michael-lewis-and-billy-beane-talk-moneyball.html&quot;&gt;Billy Beane&lt;/a&gt; of the Oakland As. Since then it's been practiced by football, basketball, and other baseball teams with much success. Moneyball says you should look at what factors make a difference in winning, and do that. An inexpensive hitter who reliably gets on base, even by walking, is more central to winning than an expensive high percentage hitter. You look at the numbers and do what they say to do. The As, a poor team, couldn't afford to buy the great players, so instead they bought players that made them win. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:29:00 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html#a172900"/>
				<source:outline text="Lakoff is the equivalent of Moneyball, but applied to politics. Lakoff's laws are observable. Hillary didn't lose because she had bad ideas, quite the opposite, she had smart ones, based on decades of experience in government, and a genius mind.

				<source:outline text="I don't think we're going to dig out of this until the leadership and the marketing people in the Democratic Party learn about Lakoff's family and framing. A book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis&quot;&gt;Michael Lewis&lt;/a&gt; would be hugely impactful." created="Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:15:59 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html#a171559"/>
				<source:outline text="PS: We will eventually sort it out, I think, if we survive Trump. The next generation of leaders in the Democratic Party are really something.

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning sports fans!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just getting started with my new iMac Pro. It seems pretty fast. I got a warning about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/98&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;, but it launched. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the big problems with the setup is that I had two old Firewire devices, one a La Cie drive and the other a very old external monitor that have plugs that don't fit into any of the ports on the back of the iMac. Not sure where I'll go with this, but the lack of an external monitor is a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/101&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for help with my iMac issues. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I guess it's time to get a new second monitor. The one I've been using is from 2006. I'm guessing the monitors have gotten better. I use the second monitor for status displays. It's like a driver-side mirror in a car. Now I have to figure out what kind of monitor to get. Figuring it probably won't be from Apple. I hear Dell makes good monitors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My new iMac Pro arrived yesterday. Nothing more to say about it than it's shiny and the keyboard and mouse are fancy, but otherwise it looks like a newly unboxed iMac. I have to say though Apple does a first class job on packing these things. There are many levels of redundancy. Not many moving parts. Just a wall plug. Otherwise everything is wireless. Of course wait until I hook up all the bullshit I have on my desk! Scanner, umpteen hard drives, sound system.</description>

			<description>Software design for older people. It's a fact as you get older your short term memory weakens. I think of something to do, get distracted for an instant, and then can't remember what I was going to do. 15 minutes later I remember. That's why even small changes to the way a piece of software work can be so disorienting. In Chrome, they changed the way the popup bookmarks menu works. Instead of popping on the right, it pops on the left. It's also much wider (probably why it pops up on the left). To people don't use Chrome a lot, or whose minds don't lose focus easily, BFD, you'll deal with it. But it's enough of a distraction that I can (just did) forget why I popped up the menu in the first place. I'd love to know why they changed the way this works. Was there any benefit for me? For anyone?</description>

			<title>What kind of person likes Trump?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A friend posted this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/30/trumpQuote.png&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Donald Trump is a stupid man's idea of a smart person, a poor man's idea of a rich man, and a weak man's idea of a strong man. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The quote is attributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Lebowitz&quot;&gt;Fran Lebowitz&lt;/a&gt;, but I can't find it on the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway this is all about men, and that got me thinking, what kind of woman likes Trump, because there are millions of them. There are also a few blacks, Hispanics and Asians who like Trump. A fair number of Jews, amazingly, like him too. And in each category, it's not just men. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've heard a woman friend say publicly that she thought he was handsome. I see it too. He could be a member of my family, same age as my uncle, and handsome in a similar way. My uncle and mother were good looking people. But they came from a horror show of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5735494,-73.8634321,3a,75y,59.93h,79.53t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sBGxHkE_-MRsfsGYsDt9-AA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;. A real war was fought there, and the children were the pawns. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was raised in a soup of abuse. And even if you think your house was a loving place, your friends houses weren't. And you probably thought they were all Ozzie and Harriet. We're &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; at hiding abuse. It's the first sin of a lot of kids, lying to cover up their parents' abuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You want to know why we elected Trump? Because we are comfortable with abuse. We are afraid to stand on our own. A kind of impostor syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to say, again, don't make men responsible for Trump. We all find him comfortable because we all were raised in an abusive environment. Ask Lakoff about it. It's a truth we don't want to face, but if we want to grow, to evolve, to get past Trump, we must face it. We must learn to move on, but not forget. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The deeper I get into this (unnamed) project the more convinced I am that GitHub makes a good object database for a CMS. I haven't hit any limits. It's slow-going only because I don't want to have to live with half-baked ideas long-term, as we did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/manual/chapter06.html&quot;&gt;with Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. Obvious advantage here is that a big tech company is maintaining the back-end at scale with good economic terms. That is also its biggest disadvantage. On the other hand GIT is very much not exclusive to GitHub/Microsoft. So here's hoping haha that they don't &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=embrace+extend+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Embrace &amp; Extend&lt;/a&gt; devs out of the picture.</description>

So here's hoping haha that they don't &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=embrace+extend+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Embrace &amp; Extend&lt;/a&gt; devs out of the picture." created="Mon, 29 Oct 2018 15:37:27 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/29/microsoftBrain.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/29.html#a153727"/>

			<description>I've been thinking how software evolution works much like natural &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/22.html&quot;&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt;. The more I learn, the better the fit. Now I understand why I like programming so much, esp projects that last years, even decades. If this is evolution, think about it, who's god?

			<title>Resurrection of blogging?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I know for sure, if you want to lead a rebirth of blogging, the first thing to do is to start blogging. The resurrection will not be led by non-bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of a public debate I had with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yochai_Benkler&quot;&gt;Yochai Benkler&lt;/a&gt; many years ago. I was stating something like this, that the best software is developed by users. He asked if you had to have cancer to develop a treatment. He stumped me with that. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My response, many years later, is that blogging is not a disease, not something to be avoided, and the tools we have for it are for human expression. A scientist would not understand the language of the human blogger if she weren't herself a blogger.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand a cancer researcher has to think like the disease, not the human. There is no chance (as far as I can imagine) for the doctor to become the cancer. So the treatments have to be developed without the first-hand experience of being a user.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There is a reason for young healthy people to buy insurance even though there is no longer a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/365185-final-gop-tax-bill-repeals-obamacare-mandate&quot;&gt;requirement&lt;/a&gt; that you do so.

They can't cut you off if you get one if you were previously covered (it would be something if they could, you could get cut off as soon as you need insurance). So starting and maintaining continuous coverage, even if you get insurance through a job, is a &lt;b&gt;good&lt;/b&gt; idea. You never know when you might become a person with a P.E.C.</description>

A funny thing for sure, because I was not aware that my blog posts appear there. I guess Manton must have hooked up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feed to my account on his site. Or maybe I did it and forgot? Either way, it's good, the more people who can hear me the better. The magic of open formats and protocols at work.</description>

			<description>If a few thousand poor people from Central America &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/24/caravan-migrants-what-is-it-where-from-guatemala-honduras-immigrants-mexico&quot;&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; to the US over 1200 miles away can threaten the well-being of our country, why are we spending $600 billion a year on defense? (The answer is they are no threat. We are set up to process them. That's why we spend so much on borders. We could look this shit up before we accept the premise of Republican hype. Jerry Brown should run for president just to get the Dems back on track hype wise. This stuff is simple, but the current Dem leadership is as Trump says weak.)</description>

			<description>BTW, if youâ€™re worried about 7000 poor refugees 1200 miles south of the US border, donâ€™t &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freak_out&quot;&gt;freak out&lt;/a&gt; but there are 129 &lt;i&gt;million&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico&quot;&gt;Mexicans&lt;/a&gt; south of the US border, most of them closer than 1200 miles.</description>

			<description>I went for a haircut today at a Russian barber shop here in NYC. They had Fox News on, which is unusual, they usually have Turner Classic Movies (one of the reasons I like the place). So Fox News was going on endlessly talking about the bombs. There was very little news, not much to say. I'm totally tuning into this these days. It's all very repetitive. Like the commenters are instruments in an orchestra who can be relied on to play certain notes when called on. The moderator, Wolf or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/24/cnnOnTheStreet.png&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; or Jake or Brett or whoever is the conductor of the orchestra. He's following a script that's whispered in his ear by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_News_(film)&quot;&gt;Holly Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Mindless crap that's been focus group tested to the max. Blah and blah oh and btw blah, blah. Polls. When is it ok to politicize. No it's too soon for sure. Stay tuned there's much more breaking news to come.</description>

Since then sheâ€™s been alive in my dreams. But now in late October my dreams have caught up. My subconscious has received the news. Iâ€™m dreaming the realization that Iâ€™ll never see her again. The feeling is of course deeper than the conscious realization. It was a shock, tinged with sadness, remorse and regret, but also a feeling of freedom, the likes of which I've never felt before.</description>

			<description>This Neil deGrasse Tyson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SXHMm5I-68&quot;&gt;segment&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution of the eye helped me understand something important about evolution. &quot;We like to think of our eyes as state of the art, but 375 million years later, we still can't see things right in front of our noses, or discern fine details in near-darkness the way fish can. When we left the water why didn't nature just start over again and evolve us a new set of eyes that were optimal for seeing in the air? Nature doesn't work that way. Evolution reshapes existing structures over generations, adapting them with small changes. It can't just go back to the drawing board and start from scratch.&quot;</description>

			<description>It's been a week since we started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/96&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about discovery in blogs. We haven't discussed much, as far as I can see, that hasn't already been tried. One idea, one-click to subscribe to a blog's feed was something we did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/22/141111.html&quot;&gt;at UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. The problem wasn't technology, it wasn't hard, rather it was how to get enough of the blogging tools to support the same calls to form critical mass. It didn't happen. Here's my conclusion on the discussion so far. Two things are needed to upgrade the blogosphere. 1. A growing excited user base. 2. A (somewhat) dominant vendor who is committed to user choice, and therefore uses open clonable formats and protocols. #1 is a prerequisite for anything to happen imho. #2 is a lesson I learned when the clonability of UserLand's products was not reciprocated by our competitors. That's an important lesson and I don't think many others are aware of it. As with our tech, it's available to anyone who wants it.</description>

			<description>I just ordered an iMac Pro. The only upgrade I got was doubling the memory to 64GB. I usually buy as little Apple memory as possible, but I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/imac-pro-review-not-a-consumer-machine-but-not-quite-perfect-for-pros-either/3/#h1&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that installing memory on this machine is not so easy. So I paid the luxury tax. The &lt;i&gt;whole thing&lt;/i&gt; is a luxury, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/22/currentMac.png&quot;&gt;current iMac&lt;/a&gt; performs pretty well. I use it as a writing machine, blogging and software, and I guess it's mostly doing I/O, it's not compute-bound. But this is the last moment for me to buy a new Mac, this is the last O/S release that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/98&quot;&gt;runs Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. There's no direct port planned as far as I know. And hopefully before this machine dies, there will be a Linux port, which is where I'd rather be spending my time. Or possibly my JavaScript codebase will be rich enough so I can port my dev tools to be independent of Frontier. Not my preferred path forward. I've been using a Mac since 1984, with a brief hiatus at the end of the 90s. The total with tax and AppleCare came to $6,497.66. It will be delivered between November 6 and 8. Just in time to either celebrate victory in the election or drown my sorrows in defeat.</description>

			<title>Radio UserLand's coffee mug</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, I reconstructed the Radio UserLand coffee mug icon in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:5335/system/pages/subscriptions?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot; title=&quot;Click on the XML coffee mug to subscribe to &amp;quot;Scripting News&amp;quot; in Radio UserLand.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/22/coffeeMugIcon.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;36&quot; height=&quot;36&quot; alt=&quot;Subscribe to &amp;quot;Dave's Handsome Radio Blog!&amp;quot; in Radio UserLand.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The icon appeared on every Radio blog, and Manila site, and on the Scripting News home page. At the time that was a lot of support believe it or not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you click the icon it sends a message to the server running on port 5335 of the local machine, which was Radio UserLand, telling it to subscribe to the URL for Scripting News' RSS feed. The app would come to the front, confirm that you want to subscribe, and if so it would add the feed to the database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It could have worked for any feed on any blog. It was our hope that it would catch on, but that wasn't the mood of the time. People wanted to blaze their own trail. And it probably should have moved to a centralized publicly owned resource, the commons (like DNS perhaps). But it wasn't meant to be, it didn't happen, and easy subscription became a feature-advantage of the silos over open blogging. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="The icon appeared on every Radio blog, and Manila site, and on the Scripting News home page. At the time that was a lot of support believe it or not." created="Mon, 22 Oct 2018 14:14:53 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/22/141111.html#a141453"/>
				<source:outline text="If you click the icon it sends a message to the server running on port 5335 of the local machine, which was Radio UserLand, telling it to subscribe to the URL for Scripting News' RSS feed. The app would come to the front, confirm that you want to subscribe, and if so it would add the feed to the database." created="Mon, 22 Oct 2018 14:11:59 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/22/141111.html#a141159"/>
				<source:outline text="It could have worked for any feed on any blog. It was our hope that it would catch on, but that wasn't the mood of the time. People wanted to blaze their own trail. And it probably should have moved to a centralized publicly owned resource, the commons (like DNS perhaps). But it wasn't meant to be, it didn't happen, and easy subscription became a feature-advantage of the silos over open blogging." created="Mon, 22 Oct 2018 14:13:02 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/10/22/141111.html#a141302"/>
