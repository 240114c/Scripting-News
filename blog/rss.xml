			<description>The brilliance of the design of our government is that we can have a mini-revolution very two years and an all-out revolution every four. But we are too spoiled and lazy to get this. If we fail to overthrow our Repub masters on Tuesday, we deserve what comes next.</description>

			<description>Dropbox is finished with its &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/02.html#a140427&quot;&gt;sync&lt;/a&gt;. The new iMac Pro desktop is up to date. This caused its own problems. I edit my blog in an outliner that saves to a Dropbox-sync'd folder. This way I can use the same editor on my laptop when I'm traveling. I reloaded the editor this morning, the month of November was gone. I guess overnight Dropbox replaced the new version with the old version. It has missed the last few days of my work. Luckily I was also writing the OPML to a server, so I had a backup copy. I could have always re-entered the text from the website, so it wasn't ever in danger of being lost. Not sure what the moral of the story is. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>A post from Facebook in 2014</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People are uncomfortable with male vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Be strong, be a man, man up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Be happy with what you have, but don't be too happy. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't mind being strong for others, being a source of protection, but inside I'm just like you. So are your sons and brothers and fathers and uncles.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have to find a good compromise. A way to be true to who we are, and have people's expectations of who we are come closer to the reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/293577557516323&quot;&gt;Original post 11/3/2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This morning &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/01.html#a153716&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is down to 1.2 million files. Yes, I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/help/syncing-uploads/lan-sync-overview&quot;&gt;LAN Sync&lt;/a&gt; turned on, on this machine and on the other machines connected to the same router. I've come up with a new temporary way to get files up to the server so my development work can continue while Dropbox is synching. Also, yes I need to be able to see my whole Dropbox structure from this machine. (Thanks for all the suggestions, I've been using Dropbox since it came out, that's a pretty long time.)</description>

			<title>Twitter's new API-wall</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nicest things about Twitter is they'd let anyone create an &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.twitter.com/&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt;. This has made it possible to build platforms that users can run on their own servers, using Twitter as the identity system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well those days are over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now you have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/02/apply.png&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt; to become a developer. I am trying to complete my application. I have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+twitter+api&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; the Twitter API as long as they've had one. But I'm pretty sure I don't match their idea of what a developer is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Luckily GitHub has as liberal a policy re devs as Twitter used to, and I have been (coincidentally) tooling up for GitHub as a development platform pretty intensely for the last month or so. Good timing I guess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it's a sad moment. I'm guessing this is part of getting control over Russian bots, which is understandable. Maybe what we need is what GitHub is providing. There, the identity system isn't connected to a mass communication system as with Facebook and Twitter. Facebook effectively closed off their API a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: My application was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1058389061583417347&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I checked in with a friend from Berkeley yesterday about stuff I had been writing here. I felt yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/30/174911.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Lakoff, family and framing was kind of a breakthrough. Lakoff's strict father vs nuturing mother, along with my recent realization that we as a society exist in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/09/29/001342.html&quot;&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt; of abuse. She said something other people have said, she didn't come from an abusive family. I accept that. It's still true that abuse is the context of our lives. It's hidden. Kids are taught to cover for their parents. Yet abuse is viewed, in our discourse, as exceptional. Something that can be fixed by punishing a few people. It's not going to be that easy. Just look at how our political system has embraced not just a strict father, but an abusive one. People voted for him. Not because they're any of the things people say they are. They voted for him because he is, to them, comfortable and trustworthy. Now look at that and tell me abuse isn't the context we live in. It's meant to be a mathematical statement, btw. Not that we chose it, or deserve it. It is what it is.</description>

			<description>24 hours later and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/31.html#a170639&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; still has over &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/11/01/dropbox.png&quot;&gt;1.5 million files&lt;/a&gt; to download. Files I already have here in my old Dropbox folder. Yesterday at this time it had 1.6 million files left. I guess it might be done by Christmas. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Files I already have here in my old Dropbox folder. Yesterday at this time it had 1.6 million files left. I guess it might be done by Christmas. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 01 Nov 2018 15:37:16 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/11/01.html#a153716"/>

			<description>I finally found something to buy that I'm genuinely excited about. I keep a second monitor to the left of my main screen. I think of it as a rear-view-mirror in a car. It's where I keep the status readouts, hit counters, server monitors, etc. I watch TV on that monitor (via Spectrum's website). Anyway, the monitor has, until now, been an old Apple screen from 2006 or so. I had bought it to go with my old Mac Pro. That old monitor can't plug into my new iMac Pro. So then I thought, let's buy a new one. Of course monitors have gotten a lot better and cheaper since 2006. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IZBIMLK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;new one&lt;/a&gt; is going to be glorious, or so I think. Should arrive later today via Amazon. Watch this &lt;a href=&quot;#a165259&quot;&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>In April, I set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://newriver5.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;demo river&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting development system for people getting started in Node. They don't charge to run your application, but if it isn't accessed frequently they put it to sleep, and wake it up next time it's accessed. Just for fun I tried installing River5. It works! And even better, here we are six months later, and the app is still running, and doing a great job of getting the news. I would have thoughth it would have to do a scan for new news when I accessed it, but it's been reading news all night. There must be other people using it? Not sure. But it's good. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>An example of framing. People who are anti-abortion say they're &quot;pro-life.&quot; If you're pro-choice you could deny them their framing and call them anti-abortion. (It's more accurate since we're all pro-life. Even people who are pro-choice.) More &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/31/171035.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
