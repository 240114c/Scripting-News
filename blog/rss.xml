			<description>There was a point in the development of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, after a few VCs invested in startups, that the consensus among them (the founders and the investors) was that RSS was theirs, and they told me to my face they weren't going to listen, because I was the old way, and they were the new. (Famous last words.) Even some people who thought they were friends did this, perhaps not so bluntly. Okay now fast forward, all the startups are gone, they were so stupid they failed for many other reasons, not just their arrogance and closed minds. Stupid people. Here's a better rule. Listen by default. Tech is filled with idiotic arrogance. It's a kind of narcissism. I am the only one who can think. Bullshit. Look at all you're building on. The people who created that not only had an idea, &lt;i&gt;but they were right. &lt;/i&gt;That's a very rare combination. And until you have built something like that, you are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; smarter. And once you have, you know other people are smart, because that's what you learn.</description>

			<description>New York should just buy a team, coaches, players, owner -- the whole thing, and move it into the Garden. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheAthleticNYC/status/1093963720877842432&quot;&gt;other city&lt;/a&gt; can have all the rookies and draft picks. New York is the greatest city in the US. It should have the greatest NBA team. We can afford it. Failing that, if Bloomberg doesn't run for president, could he just fucking buy the Knicks and manage it in an interesting way? I don't know if he's a basketball fan, but somehow I think he &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; do better than Dolan.</description>

We don't have to accept the mediocrity of Facebook and the big news orgs. There's something between that combines the best of both to make a news service that's much much much better than what we have now. We must stop accepting limits.</description>

			<description>Another idea. I'm staying in a rented house with Internet but no cable. I would like to watch a little news. It would be great if there were a web/app-only news channel, that competed with MSNBC, Fox, CNN, that was fully available over the web or Roku (or the like). It's ridiculous in 2019 that I am shut out from cable-style news just because I haven't paid Spectrum. Do we really still need them? (Note: I do pay them at my apartment in Manhattan, it's not like I'm trying to avoid paying them.)</description>

			<description>An idea for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union&quot;&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;. Why not offer personal membership in the EU to citizens of countries that withdraw from the EU. Benefits might include, they get to keep their EU passport. They can freely move between EU countries as before. They can vote in EU elections. Might lead to something interesting, like a new political party in the withdrawing country?</description>

			<description>Journalism should compete with tech. The tech companies were willing to give equal voice to users. They created a level playing field. Journalism still insists that only pros have a voice. They could create their own journalism platforms and mix things up differently.</description>

			<description>This is not only a function of the narcissism of American journalism, but of the corruption of Americans, all of us, people of color and whites, all sexual persuasions, boomers and milennials, all of us -- we're the Facebook of the world. As much as we despise and villify the current top dog in tech (Microsoft before FB and Google, btw) we are that, for the world. We are the privileged. We have collectively killed so many countries, millions of people, to maintain our control. We think of ourselves as the country we were taught about in school, but that was a bedtime story. We have done some awful shit, and the chickens may be coming home to roost real soon now.</description>

			<description>All the news sources are on the net, mostly on Twitter, these days, but Twitter is far from optimal. Any news org that wanted to compete, that actually had a strategy, would find there are openings in the market, big ones.</description>

			<description>Idea: If you're selling a house, put it on the market by listing it on AirBnB. People who are interested in buying can stay there for a few days. Might get a better price if the house has features that are only appreciated with time.</description>

			<title>Porzingas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Is it worth it being a fan of sports? Yesterday in NYC we learned first that Kristaps Porzingas, our young star, was not convinced that the culture of the Knicks had changed. Then minutes later, rumors of a trade to Dallas, a move that just clears cap space, that doesn't get the Knicks a star that's comparable in any way to the one we're giving up.  A few minutes later the deal is confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a shock. Then after letting it settle in a bit, I realized how much I had looked forward to seeing him blossom as a Knick. That all the young players the team was accumulating and developing were his team to lead, and it wasn't good enough for him. After a few years of him saying how much he loved New York, he goes to Dallas of all places, because they have a player there he'd like to play with. The ones we drafted, for him, weren't good enough, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks are not the Mets. I can handle the Mets sucking year after year, because eventually they pull it together and make history, again. There's something to hope for, to root for. But the Knicks are mired, ever since they dealt the whole roster to Denver to get Melo. Ever since then it's been one &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/02/25/meloLin.gif&quot;&gt;disappointment&lt;/a&gt;, mostly self-inflicted, after another. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I wrote this for a friend</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015 a friend was going through a tough time. The bottom had dropped out of his tech industry life. It had happened to me. I gave him the advice that worked for me, that helped me go on after my dreams of grandeur had been revealed to be foolish. I posted it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/887204091486997?notif_id=1549026273419642&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for some reason, which proves I guess that despite what so many say, it has or at least had a purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a friend who's going thru a familiar struggle. I have some advice that's imho worth sharing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Go some place natural. Alone. Where no one knows you or who you know. Subtract everything that defines you as a pundit or friend of the rich and famous. No gadgets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Swim. Get massaged. Try being quiet. Talk about your childhood. Find yourself, the person you've been hiding from.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Just be another random person, one of seven billion, because that is the truth. That is who you are. Who I am. Who everyone is. When you really feel it a weight comes off. None of this shit matters.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
