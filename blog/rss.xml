			<description>If you were going to design the ideal news reading environment, would it be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; like Twitter, or would you use the mailbox reader style of the now-defunct Google Reader? Or would you do something else entirely?</description>

			<title>It's &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; Sources Go Direct</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last time I spoke to the news industry in the US, blogging was booming, there was no Twitter, and podcasting was still very much in bootstrap mode. So I'm thinking that what I propose now, while it's basically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;same idea&lt;/a&gt; as I was promoting then, that we, the sources, the editors, and independent developers (not the big tech companies), work together to create a great open news publishing system (the basic vision of RSS, btw) might go over better than it did then.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back then, in the mid 00s,  I guess they thought I was dreaming, it was unrealistic, or whatever, but now all that I was pitching has happened. It really happened. We have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;SGD&lt;/a&gt; president. And Congress more and more is made of SGDers. But it's not happening in an open way, from my point of view because the news people won't listen, so things are faltering like crazy. Facebook, formed out of the DNA of Silicon Valley, has way too much power. News is shaped to suit their business interests, and not surprisingly this has choked off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseretnews.com/article/676103/Microsoft-executive-denies-threat-to-cut-off-air-supply.html&quot;&gt;air supply&lt;/a&gt; for the news business. That's how dominant tech companies work. I know this because before news collided with Big Tech, I was a developer in the ecosystems of several huge tech companies. My career appeared to be over at age 37 because there was no way out of the tight boxes they had created for us, poorly designed boxes, like networking on the Mac, for example. Able to do so much but so crippled through its API that developers couldn't access its power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I struggled against it, and lost. But then the web came along, and boom, we were growing again. I was sure then and am equally sure now that the news industry will meet the same fate as MS-DOS devs, Mac OS devs and then Netscape et al. There is an economic math at work here, and being in denial of it doesn't change it. (These were among the very first pieces I wrote when my blog started up in October 1994.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't expect to be liked for saying all this, but I'll try to smile &quot;smile&quot; and be affable, and maybe a few people will listen and see (as I believe) that sources and news people working together, without the big tech companies, is the only way out of the mess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Skiing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning sports fans!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went skiing yesterday for the first time in let's say five years. The last time was at Deer Valley in Park City, Utah. I remember being in extreme pain and skiing badly, and not being happy. But this time I was less than 30 minutes from a nice easy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Ski_Center&quot;&gt;ski area&lt;/a&gt; (or so I thought) in the Catskills, on the day after five inches had fallen overnight, and I sucked up my courage and went skiing. It was painful, but I took it slow, and at times even felt in charge. It's the feeling where your boots are where you express your will to move in this direction or that. The skis in front and back of the boot almost aren't there. You move your ass one way to turn the other. When you get in that zone it's fun. I played another little mental game, sometimes when I'm &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/07/05/bikingVsSkiing.html&quot;&gt;bike riding&lt;/a&gt; I pretend I'm skiing. This time I pretended I was bike riding. A new thing. Now this morning I'm sore from head to toe, but I feel gratified. I did it. I can still ski. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I learned is that the vertical drop on Catskills ski areas are pretty good. The big difference is elevation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Ski_Center&quot;&gt;Belleayre&lt;/a&gt;, where I was skiing yesterday has a base elevation of 2000 feet, compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Valley&quot;&gt;Deer Valley&lt;/a&gt; at 6500 feet. That's why the snow is so much nicer at the latter. It rains a bunch in the winter in the Catskills. Enough to make the snow wet sometimes and icy others. But yesterday it was perfect. The snow was the kind of stuff Utah is famous for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of these days a thinker-about-journalism is going to have an epiphany, like this. Hey the crisis in journalism isn't just about me and other journalists. The people need and want journalism too. Maybe we should include them in the discussion about what to do?</description>

			<description>I recommend watching this 9-minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH5oW3ynOFk&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kendzior&quot;&gt;Sarah Kendzior&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 about her experience as a journalist in NYC in 2000 and how things changed. At the beginning, she was paid enough to rent an apartment in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Queens&quot;&gt;Astoria&lt;/a&gt; for $900 a month. By 2015, the same apartment rented for $2500 and her former job at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/&quot;&gt;Daily News&lt;/a&gt; was now an internship that paid nothing. It's the first time I've heard the story told by someone who is not going on to say how tech needs to pay for the salaries of reporters. Her story is simple, compelling, and gives the problem of what to do to the listener. From here we can begin the discussion about how we proceed. Do we bet everything on finding a business model that returns journalism to the model that worked before the web? And if we do that, is that all we do? Is there no Plan B? No way to hedge against that not working? The truth is we need journalism. My job, as I see it, is to work on Plan B. Always have seen it that way. I'm not Craig Newmark or the Knights. I have no vast pile of money to pay to journalists to keep them employed. And even if I did, I think that's the wrong answer. I believe we need journalism to work. We all do. And I think it has to work &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; than it has worked before the web. My answer is not popular with journalists. They have a lot of power to shape the discussion, but journalism does not exist to serve them. It's for all of us.</description>

It's a sweet car all around, but the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; thing about it is it fits me. For my whole life I've been driving cars that were too small. I'd have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=contort&quot;&gt;contort&lt;/a&gt; myself to get in and out. Not the Forester.</description>

			<title>Does podcasting need a Netflix?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's time to do some work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;Podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt;, to make it possible for anyone to turn a list of podcast feeds into a reverse chronologic river of new shows. Help the open network push back against the VC-backed silos.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The diff betw podcasts and Netflix, btw is this. Movies and TV shows are almost all licensed, because they are very expensive to produce. Podcasts are not expensive, yes I know some orgs spend a lot of money but I don't think that makes them better. And the infrastructure for movies is super expensive and the infrastructure for MP3s is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of reasons why podcasts will never need the kind of service that Netflix provides for video. But if we don't put up any open services, the lock-in might happen anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Podcasts are not expensive, yes I know some orgs spend a lot of money but I don't think that makes them better. And the infrastructure for movies is super expensive and the infrastructure for MP3s is not." created="Mon, 04 Mar 2019 03:24:43 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/03/03/032400.html#a032443"/>
				<source:outline text="There are all kinds of reasons why podcasts will never need the kind of service that Netflix provides for video. But if we don't put up any open services, the lock-in might happen anyway." created="Mon, 04 Mar 2019 03:25:50 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/03/03/032400.html#a032550"/>

			<description>When I was a teen, buying tickets at Carnegie Hall, a nice old man said he lost his wallet. If I loaned him $20 heâ€™d send me $50 when he got home to Connecticut. I gave him the money and my address. The old guy is Trump and his voters gave him the money.</description>

			<description>Adweek is a sneaky outfit. If you go there with an ad blocker on you get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/01/adweek.png&quot;&gt;this scolding&lt;/a&gt;. So if you turn the ad blocker off, you still can't read the article. This is supposed to make you do what? Subscribe? Not really, I wonder if they user-tested this.</description>

			<description>Over on Twitter, a question -- &quot;What do you do to feel more confident?&quot; I have an answer, but it's sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NSFW&quot;&gt;NSFW&lt;/a&gt;. So I'll post it here instead of there. Certain drugs in  your bloodstream give you confidence. Not sure if this is true for women, but it is true for me, and I'd guess for other men. So when I'm feeling frail, or sad, or lacking direction, I stimulate my body to produce this drug. It's never failed. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Buying furniture online?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The web is showing me lots of furniture ads these days. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hayneedle.com/product/kodiakfurniturealbanylinenconvertiblefutonsofa1.cfm&quot;&gt;example of an ad&lt;/a&gt; for a simple convertible couch that looks really nice imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing I don't understand. How can you buy furniture online? I can't get a feel for it. This little couch is very cheap. It must feel cheap, right? But it doesn't &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How can people buy something like this without sitting on it first? How does this work? Plenty of people must buy this way or there wouldn't be so many businesses selling this way, I assume...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
