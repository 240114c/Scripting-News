			<description>We ought to, instead of talking about how &lt;s&gt;deficient&lt;/s&gt; defunct Trump is, talk about the job of POTUS, what his or her responsibilities are, for future reference, so thereâ€™s never again a doubt as to whether the incumbent is doing the job.</description>

			<description>I suggest we use the word &quot;trump&quot; (lower case) to refer to what we used to call the Republican Party. Example of usage: &quot;That trump is really corrupt. Yeah they all are.&quot;</description>

			<title>Rudy Kiesler</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My maternal grandfather, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rudykiesler.com/&quot;&gt;Rudy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;, was a bundle of energy. Highly opinionated. Very loud. Didn't spend a lot of time thinking (or so it seemed to me as a child) he just burst into action. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was the 13th of 13 children, born in the land between Poland and Germany, sent off to fend for himself as a very young boy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jewish, he was deported in the first rounds of the Nazi regime, leaving my grandmother and mother behind. Lucie, my grandmother, was Lutheran, blonde-haired, blue-eyed Aryan princess. Why they married is something I never understood. They didn't seem to have anything in common.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the women were left in Germany or Czechoslavakia, I'm not clear on which, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+rudy+kiesler&amp;t=hy&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Rudy K&lt;/a&gt; was in Brooklyn or Queens, setting up a garment business, which he ran until he had a stroke in the 1970s. With no heir wanting to inherit the business, he sold the company, United Pioneer, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/53/Salant-Corporation.html&quot;&gt;Salant &amp; Salant&lt;/a&gt;. But he was always a bundle of energy, until he drifted away in a nursing home and died in the early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He would not have liked this &quot;stay home stay safe&quot; thing. I can't imagine he would have done it. He was the kind of guy who couldn't stand to wait in a line at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair&quot;&gt;World's Fair&lt;/a&gt;, so he'd cut in front of the person at the front of the line, and when they complained, he'd ignore them (this actually happened). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/22/kieslers.gif&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/09/22.html#l60a1aad9dbba17d33466766294610e29&quot;&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; in Rockaway probably in 1961 or so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was a legend. Still looms large in my mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Tabs on scripting.com</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I changed the way tabs work on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; home page.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are three tabs: Blog, Links and About.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click on a tab, you are redirected with a url of this form:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;http://scripting.com/?tab=&lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; is the name of the tab you're going to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That way you always have a link to the tab in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the browser's Back button works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It used to do it all with JavaScript without redirecting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also no longer remembers what tab you had frontmost last time you visited the site. This was always annoying. Not a good heuristic. When I come to scripting.com 99 times out of 100 I want to see the blog. It doesn't matter what I was looking at last time I visited. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was suggested a long time ago, has been on my todo list ever since, and I finally got around to doing it. It's even worse than it appears. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/covid19/covid-counter.html&quot;&gt;This is great&lt;/a&gt;. Stanford University is setting up a network of Americans around the country to track their symptoms and exposure to people with CV. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/23.html#a154211&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; traveled through Seoul on her way home, she had to install a mobile app to keep a diary of her symptoms, if any. This is how they do containment, and it's great to see a similar system starting in the US, from a credible institution like Stanford. We're on the road now. Every American reader of this blog should sign up for daily reminders, and do it. If I could make it a requirement, I would. America being smart.</description>

Not old enough to have gotten it myself, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine&quot;&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; already existed when I was born. But there were kids in my school that had been crippled by it.</description>

			<description>I'm okay with people going to church as long as we can lock the doors after they're all inside. They should not be allowed to re-enter society after being so reckless with their own health. On FB they're saying they should stay inside for 14 days and those without symptoms be allowed to leave. I am reminded of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/05/never.png&quot;&gt;New Yorker cartoon&lt;/a&gt;. I think &quot;never&quot; is a better time to let them out.</description>

It is anonymous in aggregate so they can predict areas that will be most impacted based on how you are feeling. This data can help redirect medical resources and give public guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Think about it. Most of us, if exposed, may develop a mild case and stay home to recover. We may not be able to be tested because we are not sick enough. There aren't enough tests available either. That data point is considered &quot;under the radar&quot; and is not reported in the daily numbers we hear on the news.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But if we knew how people felt, self-reporting symptoms, we could get a jump on it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Given the 9-10 day delay between onset of symptoms and hospitalization, and the 20% hospitalization rate of patients, this type of survey tool can help fight the Coronavirus.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Please consider taking this survey to help end this pandemic quickly. You can opt out at any time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How CV got started in the US</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/04.html#a152322&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; a somewhat nuanced question, basically why does the virus travel in waves across the United States? Why is it not distributed uniformly across the country? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A retired bioresearcher sent via email a non-mathematical explanation that makes sense to me. Note he talks about places where Asians are in the US, it's a bit delicate, but since the virus originated in China, and I'm trying to understand why it's not everywhere, it is factually relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the story:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My degree is not in mathematics but after forty years in bioresearch I hope I know how to think logically. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People do move freely about the US, but it isnâ€™t random movement. There are also nuances in genetic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)&quot;&gt;endemic disease&lt;/a&gt;, age distribution demographics, health care infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Travelers congregate at airports, on cruise ships, and mingle at tourist destinations. There have been numerous maps published that show how spread of the virus aligns with popular travel routes and political alignments. Winter holiday travel turned out to be a particularly bad idea last year.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Our index case was already symptomatic when he left Wuhan and came home to Seattle in mid-January. New York didnâ€™t see their first case until March (via Iran). Both are coastal cities with seaports, major airports, universities, and diverse populations, but NYC is half the size of Seattle and has about nine times as many people. New Yorkers literally canâ€™t get away from each other.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Chinese Americans are not homogeneously distributed across the US, and they tend to live, work, and travel in aggregates. NYC and Seattle demographics show about the same proportions of Asians, but NYCâ€™s are jammed more tightly together and an airborne contagion would hit more people, more quickly there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;California's significant Asian population is clustered in Santa Clara County, by far the hardest hit by the virus. The state has been under shelter-in-place orders since mid-March. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia has a tiny Asian population and theyâ€™re all in one district. Philly also has a very large and well-equipped hospital in Center City; theyâ€™re prepared.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Drilling down into the data in my area, West Virginia was late to the party imo because the folks who choose to live there like their solitude in the woods, and they donâ€™t travel much. This held back the spread in the western parts of adjacent states (Maryland and Pennsylvania) where the first cases werenâ€™t seen intil mid-March. None of these areas have  significant Asian populations.The two Maryland counties with large Asian populations recorded their first cases a month earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The wave thing is - once the virus is in the door, one way or another itâ€™s gonna find you - itâ€™ll getcha getcha getcha - unless it canâ€™t, of course.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have additional info re this piece, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/162&quot;&gt;post here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I asked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1246347423045337089&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter this morning that apparently was not understood. Let's try again. When Gov Cuomo says that NY got hit first, I want to know why other American cities didn't get hit at roughly the same time. They say a virus moves in waves. First northern Italy gets it, then the south. NY has its hospitals overloaded, but not Philadelphia. The theory is, according to Cuomo, that the virus will peak in NY, and then peak in other places. Since people move freely around the US, why wouldn't it all happen at roughly the same time. I'd like you to remember, before answering, I have a math degree, and have spent decades working with logic and numbers in computer software. Saying that Dallas has cases, as has St Louis and Cleveland, while true, is not an answer to this puzzling question. Thanks in advance for considering this.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/my-podcasts/new-feed&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Cuomo podcast&lt;/a&gt; to iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It failed in my first attempt. Here are the messages I got.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Podcast artwork must be between 1400 x 1400 and 3000 x 3000 pixels, JPG or PNG, in RGB color space, and hosted on a server that allows HTTP head requests.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Canâ€™t submit your feed. There is no category tag in your feed, or the category tag is empty.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Canâ€™t submit your feed. There is no explicit tag in your feed, or the explicit tag is empty.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure how how you're supposed to specify &quot;podcast artwork.&quot; Guessing it's the channel-level &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/xml/rss_tag_image.asp&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; element. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In any case this isn't going to be a quick thing. I have to update my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daverss&quot;&gt;RSS package&lt;/a&gt; to allow for the new metadata they want. And I have a feeling from some of the docs that they want us to use HTTPS, which is somewhat of a deal-stopper. Yes I know the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/#1519488824000&quot;&gt;usual arguments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: I got the podcast through their validator and it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/04/submitted.png&quot;&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; for review.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The parent and child, in crisis</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're all depressed. I heard this explained well &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurenthehough/status/1246318803077804033&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; last night. Our brain tries to understand the predicament. Not the intellectual brain, the instinctive one. The subconscious. The child. The one that decides in an instant to fight or flight. The one that keeps your organs functioning, oversees the immune system's response to an invader. It's very powerful, but its vision is limited to the input coming in through your senses. It's not very well wired up to your conscious self, the intellect. Something is threatening you, it can detect that, but it doesn't understand what it is. So it makes you numb while it tries to figure it out. But it never can. So you feel depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all in this place. Yet somehow we manage to do things. To take care. Clean, feed, nurture ourselves. To find distractions. We create moments where we feel well. I've watched myself do this, and see myself doing something I learned in various workshops and classes I participated in, in my 30s and 40s. It involves another duality inside of all of us, the dependent child and the nurturing parent. I literally give voice to the parent. Let it speak, out loud, to the child.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm lying in bed at 10AM. I don't want to get up. The parent's voice says, Dave, it's time to get up. I don't want to, I don't want to. The parent holds my hand, and says don't worry, I've got this. I'll give you something good to eat, something delicious and filling. Then we'll play a game, and go for a walk, and the list goes on. Things my inner child likes. It doesn't matter so much that he likes these things, but that the patient, loving voice &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; he likes these things and will give them to him. Someone has taken charge, and the scared little boy feels loved, guarded, cherished. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why we like listening to Gov Cuomo, and can't stand listening to Trump. The former says I've got this. I'll get us through this. You can depend on me. The latter says I'm going to fuck things up even worse than they are. The former helps us get out of bed and face the world, the latter makes us want to pull the covers over our head and pretend we're in another place and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As adults, all of us have an inner parent we can call on, if we remember to do it. A leader like Cuomo helps us access our strength and determination, helps calm the fears of the child. We may not know the answers, but we will find them, together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Narcos taught me something</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138189/narcos-mexico-review-netflix-season-two&quot;&gt;Narcos/Mexico&lt;/a&gt; just opened my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Season 1, Episode 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A young guy with a big idea gambles big and loses because his boss is an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's being taken off to be executed, but he's cool. He knows he's going to be killed. He took a risk and lost. He's ok with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Cops flag down the car, make everyone get out and they shoot everyone but the guy who was about to be killed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The cops were part of the big deal, and they liked the smart young dude so they killed his boss and made him the new boss.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Very nicely done, and even though I had seen it before, it totally held my interest. And I was glad to see it on April 4, 2020. If this is the end, why not go out with dignity and style?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought it was an interesting perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A bunch of things to write about today. Rolling up my sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the old days of blogging I had subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://val.demar.in/&quot;&gt;Paolo Valdemarin's blog&lt;/a&gt;. Then Paolo must've gotten busy, being an entrepreneur in Italy, and now a VC in London. Then once they had the lockdown in the UK, he started blogging again. My RSS aggregator, which had been checking his feed every fifteen minutes during his decade-long hiatus, sprung to life. The lights came on. Paolo is a much better writer than I remembered. His blog flows, his stories are human, his observations are easy to relate to. Silver linings everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnnaughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt;, though he never stopped writing. He's a columnist at the Guardian, also from the UK, a great thinker and observer. His blog is now published every morning (my timezone) &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/&quot;&gt;via Substack&lt;/a&gt;. I looked at using Substack before writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;my own software&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't like that I would have to manually transcribe my posts from my CMS to theirs to get them to publish it. It's 2020 for crying out loud. Support the standards. Or maybe they want their users locked in? I can't tell you how many times I've had to reimplement the entire functionality of a product to avoid having to manually transpose my writing or avoid lock-in. It's a VC way of thinking and not observant of the fundamental law of the web, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3&quot;&gt;people come back to places that send them away&lt;/a&gt;. Trust your users. If you have the best product, they'll continue to use it and sing your praises. If you don't, they'll bolt at the first opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Naughton also wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://privatekit.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Private Kit&lt;/a&gt;, though I can't find the reference now. It's a brilliant idea. An app for iOS or Android that tracks your whereabouts, but doesn't share the data with anyone but you. The info never leaves your phone without your permission. It offers new opportunities for resarchers studying among other things the migration of pandemic viruses through the population. This is the future, and a very nice way to spin it, MIT. Keep up the good work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It sucks that there isn't a wiki-type food ordering app that takes no percentage of sales. I want the money to go to the deliverers and the restaurants. The restaurant would pay a flat monthly fee. At this late date there is no justification for the money the middlemen make.</description>

			<description>We will all be more patient in the future. What's a few minutes compared to all the waiting we're doing now. It's funny, I could keep developing, nothing in my way, but for the first time in a long time, I can't get the excitement or even the interest to actually do the work. Not that I don't get ideas. I'm much more interested in finding a good online version of Hearts, Sorry or Risk. Or if there were a way to play Wii games online. Now that would be interesting.

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-fauci.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci&quot;&gt;Anthony Fauci&lt;/a&gt; may be the most consequential podcast ever. In the last ten minutes they finally get to the important stuff, i.e. what's coming. Now I understand the next phase of the virus much better. I'm also glad to hear they're considering the functioning of society in their plans. At some point we're going to have to provide health care to the people who can't afford it, if we ever want to come out of this. Imho the sooner the better, but Fauci has to take as a given that the president is who he is. I've never said anything was more of a must-listen than this podcast. I think they should play the last ten minutes on Maddow tonight. Everyone with a mind needs to hear this.</description>

			<description>Think before you RT. I am once again unfollowing people who RT Trump, and I am now also unfollowing people who RT Kellyanne Conway. They make us stupid. Waste our capacity to think. Reduce everything to emotion. Trump and Conway are intellectual pneumonia. They fill your mind with emotional nonsense, crowding out your ability to think. The cure is simple. Distance yourself from them, and people who are infected with them. Even people you like.</description>

			<title>JavaScript plug-ins for PagePark</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a technical description of a new server bridge between two apps, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;. It's now possible to view user-editable files through PagePark as long as they've been made public. This is how the pieces fit together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; is a Node-based HTTP server that has special understanding of two kinds of files -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For Markdown files, it renders them in a template. So you don't have to repeat the envelope for each bit of text, and it's easy to modify, for all pages. So it's a bit of a CMS for Markdown files. It also can connect directly to GitHub repos, so it can serve from them, which is nice because Markdown is a default format on GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PagePark also has a special ability to render &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; files. I use this feature for my this.how site which I've been using to accumulate documents that I want to revise over time. Unlike blog posts, they are not ephemeral. Examples include my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;Trolling howto&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt; doc. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So to sum up, what's special about PagePark, for this situation, is that it's really good at rendering OPML documents.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outline editor&lt;/a&gt; that runs in a web browser. Its native format is &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every file you edit with &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; is either public or private. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a copy of PagePark running on the same machine as the server that runs Little Outliner. I created a bridge between the two apps, on the server, that allows PagePark to serve from each users' public folder. When you access the page, you'll see a beautifully rendered version, like my this.how documents. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.this.how/davewiner/example.opml&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This might sound complicated, because you've probably never thought of the software that runs these apps. But conceptually it's simple. There's a new bridge between &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt;. That bridge is a PagePark plug-in.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been talking about the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md&quot;&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt; ability for PagePark. I needed that to create this connection. I've designed a lot of plug-in architectures over many years, and this is a good one. All web servers running in JavaScript should consider doing it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md#a-plug-in-is-a-module&quot;&gt;this way&lt;/a&gt;. The plug-in I use for this bridge, is a bit of logic that translates a URL from the outside, to a file in the user's public folder. I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/a676b0da36c13576877a91fc77a34ecb&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the source. As you can see, there's not much there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To really nail it, it turns this &lt;a href=&quot;http://storage2.littleoutliner.com/users/davewiner/myOutlines/example.opml&quot;&gt;source file&lt;/a&gt; into this &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.this.how/davewiner/example.opml&quot;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;. That's it. The next step, soon, will be to present a document that explains how to edit and view these files through the new bridge.

						<source:outline text="For Markdown files, it renders them in a template. So you don't have to repeat the envelope for each bit of text, and it's easy to modify, for all pages. So it's a bit of a CMS for Markdown files. It also can connect directly to GitHub repos, so it can serve from them, which is nice because Markdown is a default format on GitHub." created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:23:52 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a162352"/>
						<source:outline text="PagePark also has a special ability to render &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; files. I use this feature for my this.how site which I've been using to accumulate documents that I want to revise over time. Unlike blog posts, they are not ephemeral. Examples include my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;Trolling howto&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt; doc." created="Thu, 02 Apr 2020 16:24:15 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/04/02/162221.html?title=javascriptPluginsForPagepark#a162415"/>

We've never turned off the world economy like this. We have had disasters where whole cities were decimated, but the world around them was able to absorb the flow of people, and send enough people and money in to rebuild. But what happens when there is no place to go, nor enough people to come in and help rebuild?</description>
