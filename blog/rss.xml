			<description>I had to run errands into Kingston just now and heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo&quot;&gt;Gov Cuomo's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3h9Z4u4icM&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;. He is masterful. I feel like there's someone in charge who knows what to do and is doing it. I feel lucky to live in New York State, wish we had something approaching that kind of leadership in Washington.</description>

			<description>Now I wish there were a podcast feed for his press conferences so I could listen to them asynchronously. I won't always be able to listen when they're happening. Maybe this is something WNYC or the NY Times could do? Betaworks?</description>

			<description>Rachel Maddow cried at the end of her show last night. I assume for her colleague, a man about my age, who died of CV. But it meant something personal to each of us. I saw it as her crying for the end of America. Reagan was right, government is the problem. But not the way Reagan meant it. I don't know what goes through the minds of the Republicans in Washington, I can't find a bottom to their depravity. It's possible they're masochists. They feel they, and we, deserve to die.</description>

			<description>There’s a ticking time bomb. The people who don’t have health insurance and don’t have savings or a job and aren’t part of the stimulus, these people are going to be broke, hungry, homeless and sick. And on CNN they’re talking about Trump's racist tweets.</description>

			<description>Most times we can convince ourselves that in the immediate future:  1. We will remain alive and well.  2. Our friends and family will too.  What's so unsettling about the moment: Now we know that either, we will be sick or die, or some of our friends and family will. I think that's why we are all reaching out to our friends now, and re-establishing the connection, because we want to hold them close so they don't leave us. It's a good thing. In this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/springtime-in-the-plague-year/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, at the end, Andrew Sullivan talks about that re AIDS, which he experienced as a gay man in the 80s and 90s.  I experienced it as a man with a fatally sick heart in the 00s. After being fixed, I felt like I wanted to die. Weird, right? But real. We call the first feeling &quot;normal.&quot;  Over time, this will become normal.  Then at some point, if we survive, a vaccine or treatment will come about.   And we'll go through the unsettled feeling again.</description>

			<title>From NYC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Via email from a young friend who lives in NYC, a medical researcher.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a spectacularly beautiful spring day. I went out biking in the park in the afternoon. Others had the same idea, and it was so crowded it quickly became almost impossible to maintain the 6 foot distance even while riding a bike. The fact is, NYC is just too crowded to make this work well -- social distancing is just not what this city is about. I'm not seeing the kind of distancing you'd hope to see out here; New York has always felt like a human zoo to me, and it still does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My friend and former co-worker's wife is a doctor, just finishing her hospital residency, and they're preparing for all-out war. Constructing tent hospitals outside all the major hospitals to deal with the expected overflow. 5000 confirmed cases now means there were tens of thousands infected a week ago, by the end of this week we will have tens of thousands confirmed, and likely over 100K in less than a month. I am fully expecting NYC to be not only the worst-hit city in the U.S., but possibly the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have listened to that natural instinct I felt when I first visited this place -- too many people, get out -- but it's too late now, I'm riding this out right here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/19.html#a141211&quot;&gt;travels&lt;/a&gt; of NakedJen. She made it to Seoul. I had a voice chat with her just after midnight Eastern. I wanted to discuss a possible twist to her travels. In Seoul, she has a good network through the University of Utah. Of course it's one of the few places where the virus is being fought effectively, the US is a somewhere between a shitshow and a clusterfuck. I wanted to suggested she skip the return to the US and just stay there for the duration. Of course she was thinking about that. She had decided to let fate determine the outcome. If her flight to Seattle wasn't canceled she would return. If not, she'd stay in Seoul, and not try to return through some other hub like Dubai. It's pretty clear now that there aren't going to be many, if any, more flights to the US from South Korea, or anywhere for that matter. At about 5AM, I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/20/jenplane.png&quot;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt; saying she was on the plane. A few minutes later it &lt;a href=&quot;https://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL198&quot;&gt;took off&lt;/a&gt;. I'm happy, I'd like to see her again, and I'm not sure that could happen if she had stayed there. Also, I'm not sure if Jen is better off here, but we are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Renting cruise ships seems like a good idea. Park them in the Hudson River, and use them for isolation. They have all the systems you need to keep people going. Or better yet instead of bailing out the cruise ship lines, buy the boats. We're going to need them for a long time. And will want to modify them.</description>

			<description>If you're a longtime reader of my blog, you know one of my best friends is &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+nakedjen&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; of Salt Lake City and Santa Cruz. Deadhead. First of her name. Dog person. Movie lover. Advocate for beets. &quot;The first faerie off the ferry.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/05/04/thecutelittlenut.html&quot;&gt;The cute little nut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/11/16/nakedjensBlissBag&quot;&gt;That's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2012/december/nakedjen2012&quot;&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, the CLN decided just as all hell was about to break loose in SLC to go to Bali. I watched it happen. I didn't say anything because I was sure lots of people were saying it. If this is what was meant to be, so be it. Anyway, as the shit began to hit the fan here, after Trump closed us off from Europe, I got word that Jen is coming home. Good. It hasn't been easy. Few flights, and lots of cancellations. But -- her flight from Bali to Seoul is at 1AM, which is 1PM Eastern. From there, I'm guessing she goes to Los Angeles and then to Salt Lake. I'm sure Jen will be Jen where ever she is. If she has to weather this out in Bali, or Seoul, or even LA. But we really do want her back in the good old US of A.</description>

			<title>What comes next</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been pretty frank here as the crisis developed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/142306.html?title=ourPrecariousPosition&quot;&gt;early March&lt;/a&gt;, and we now are much further along, and there's more bad news coming. I'm inferring this from what I've heard about what has already happened in north Italy, and what we know is happening here, from doctors, and public info. You can find links to all my sources on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Health care workers need protective gear, asap. This is a higher priority than testing, believe it or not. Here's why. A lot of health care workers in the US either have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&quot;&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; or are going to get it soon. When they get it a decision has to be made whether to isolate or not. Of course they should be isolated, not just for our protection, but to get them the rest and care they need. On the other hand, if they are isolated they can't care for non-medical people who are infected. So, there's an exponential curve operating here. Over time, all health care workers will have to be isolated, or infect new people, or get very sick and possibly die. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our health care system will fail.&lt;/i&gt; That means people who get the virus won't get help. You'll stay at home, and recover if that was meant to be, or not. It's too late to stop this from happening. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The supply chain for food and other essentials is shaky. I've learned a bit about that in putting together the &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/&quot;&gt;Woodstock Today&lt;/a&gt; page. The local retailers talk about the supply chain, openly, on the record. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/#1584550615000&quot;&gt;Cub Market&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/#1584558640000&quot;&gt;Woodstock Hardware&lt;/a&gt; for examples. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The best system we have, it seems to me, is Amazon plus UPS/Fedex. But there are real problems in that system, inside Amazon with infections at warehouses and in the delivery services. I have no idea about Amazon's supply side. However, some of the items I have ordered recently from Amazon have been delivered. I have a thermometer coming all by itself from China. I think however it will be returned by UPS at the very last step in the delivery chain. I hope not. I'd really like to take my own temperature! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I realized how essential Amazon had become I posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/17.html#a182847&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on the home page.  &lt;i&gt;Amazon has become the indispensible company. &lt;/i&gt;It's a huge problem that the president has a problem speaking with Bezos. This connection is too valuable to be left idle.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; has also become indispensible. They are really rising to the occasion. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, for people who think the incompetence here is unprecedented, it is not. Two examples in my own lifetime. 1. The AIDS epidemic. It took years before the US government recognized there was a problem and started fighting the virus. 2. Puerto Rico's hurricane and earthquake. We let the island which is part of the United States die. No help at all. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If we want a competent government, we have to make it so. A lot of us have managed not to suffer for all the crazy shit the US government has been doing for decades. But now it's come home to everyone. This gives us a chance to turn in a new direction. I hope we do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Finally, the trillion dollar stimulus must go to shoring up the hospitals and food supply chain, and making sure people have enough money for basics. That way we can assure that the part of the economy we need to survive will continue to exist. The rest of it, airlines, cruise ships, hotels, they will be repurposed for other uses. For scrap perhaps, or to house the homeless or sick. People have no idea what a months-long shutdown of the economy will do. We will be different people when and if we emerge. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The trillion dollar stimulus should go to shoring up the hospitals and food supply chain, and making sure people have enough money for basics. We should not be bailing out the travel industry. By the time this is over there will not be a travel industry. Money spent there is as foolish as spending money on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Don't piss this away. We need help.</description>

			<source:outline text="The trillion dollar stimulus should go to shoring up the hospitals and food supply chain, and making sure people have enough money for basics.

			<description>I ordered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/18/thermometer.png&quot;&gt;thermometer&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon for delivery sometime in April. They sent an email that it just shipped and it'll be here by March 23. How could that be? Are they sending it via bicycle? Well, turns out it's coming from China. We should be nice to China. We need them. They're going to help me keep track of my temperature. Maybe alleviate a little of my anxiety. Now the question is will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+ups&quot;&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; deliver it to me, or automatically return it without trying. Something they've been doing for a while now.</description>

			<description>Speaking of anxiety, I've been relatively anxiety-free since I got out on my own in my early 20s. All through my childhood I had terrible anxiety, which manifested in an unhappy digestive system. Always had a stomach ache, trouble controlling my bowels. Upset. I was always upset. I understood why totally, my parents created a very tense atmosphere, and after many years of therapy and self-examination I understood why they were so tense. But a few years after I established myself outside their house the digestive problems magically went away. They're back. Started just after watching Trump's Oval Office speech last Wednesday. I was already hunkered down. I understood what was coming. What was clear from his speech that he didn't. He was still throwing out racist bullshit. From the fucking Oval Office. After that, I realized fully how fucked we are. There have been moments of relaxation. But they're few and far between now.</description>

			<description>I met a driver for a big delivery company that does a lot of work for Amazon. He said they can't get gloves or hand cleaners. They know the boxes carry the virus for up to a day. Can't get time off to take care of the kids, so the grandmother is. The union is involved. Sounds like the whole thing is about to be shut down, which of course should not be allowed to happen. We need direct-to-home delivery. It's hugely important. If we had a government this would be high on the priority list.</description>

			<title>Be careful with takeout food</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked a theoretical &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1239548652504391680&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to take a drive today. I like to stop off at a McDonald's and get an Egg McMuffin and a coffee on this drive. The question is -- is this safe? What if someone preparing the food has the virus. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everyone said it was not safe. Later I thought, wait -- the virus has to enter the lungs. If you eat it, it's harmless, it never makes it to the lungs. I asked a doctor friend. He says: You are wrong. Don't eat it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The virus in the food attaches to receptors on the cells of the back of your throat, like any cold virus, and is taken into those cells, after which you become infected. It spreads to your lungs later. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He continued:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it's super hot, that kills the virus. This is what I've been doing: order food, use gloves to touch the packaging. When you get home, open the package, dump the food out onto a plate, then throw that plate in the oven (or if you can heat on the stove, in a pot), then dump the packaging and wash hands. Packaging more likely to have the virus, but heat the food to almost boiling as well to ensure everything is dead. Hot food only, get a hot coffee and ice it yourself. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Everyone said it was not safe. Later I thought, wait -- the virus has to enter the lungs. If you eat it, it's harmless, it never makes it to the lungs.

					<source:outline text="If it's super hot, that kills the virus. This is what I've been doing: order food, use gloves to touch the packaging. When you get home, open the package, dump the food out onto a plate, then throw that plate in the oven (or if you can heat on the stove, in a pot), then dump the packaging and wash hands. Packaging more likely to have the virus, but heat the food to almost boiling as well to ensure everything is dead. Hot food only, get a hot coffee and ice it yourself." created="Tue, 17 Mar 2020 14:18:30 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/17/141420.html?title=beCarefulWithTakeoutFood#a141830"/>

			<description>Someone should make a video game for the iPad (where I play) that simulates a virus infecting the population of Earth. Your job is to keep the most people alive and win re-election for the president (who randomly might be Trump, Obama, Hubert Humphrey or Elizabeth Warren). Or if you prefer, you can crash the civilization, have everyone behave badly, and die horrible deaths. You get to be god, as with SimCity. This might be called SimVirus. I bet someone has already done it.</description>

They've been bungling every step of the way. So what happens when the end of the week comes and there are still no tests.</description>
