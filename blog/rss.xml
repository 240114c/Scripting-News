			<description>Andrew Shell opens a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrewshell/status/1216370917225517056&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;, an iOS podcast client, asking why he was unable to subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out Overcast doesn't like titleless posts. I don't use Overcast myself, so I can't offer specific advice, but it is not acceptable to use the file name as a title. That's not what the file name is for. I described the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216404689719365634&quot;&gt;use-case&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet (of course without a title, tweets don't have titles). Vendors tend to ignore advice on these issues, and that's kept us from growing. I used to budge for them on this issue, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;decided in 2017&lt;/a&gt; to stop. All the compromises meant that my blog disappears. Bottom-line: I put podcasts on title-less posts. &lt;i&gt;That's never going to change. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>I was hooked on Klobuchar when she stared down &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/28/brett-kavanaugh-amy-klobuchar-drinking-apology-tsr-bts-vpx.cnn&quot;&gt;Kavanaugh&lt;/a&gt; in his confirmation hearing. She doesn't rattle. I think Trump should be followed by a woman, one the Repubs have yet had a chance to work on. I don't think Americans will stand for him abusing her.</description>

			<title>Journalists: We are not you</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On this day four years ago the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/12/0848.html&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; of bloggers wanting to replace reporters came up again. This was yet another colossal misunderstanding, much like the disconnect re Facebook today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We, bloggers, seem to always be trying to assuage journalists' fear of us. That really shoudn't be necessary, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar: How refreshing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bensmith/iran-war-twitter&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt;, editor in chief at Buzzfeed News, refers to the &quot;the enduring positive qualities of social media.&quot; I wonder if his colleagues at Buzzfeed and other pubs tuned into that. How about a series of columns, updated to 2020 reality, that explore those positive qualities, to balance all the horror stories running in the NYT and elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I observe that journalists tend be blind when it comes to voters, users, writers, developers, anyone but politicians, rich people, and other journalists. We hardly exist as individuals, we're only considered in the aggregate (polls and the like). They shrink their world, furiously, so they can deal with it. Huge disconnects result. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This cartoon ran at the DNC in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html&quot;&gt;ISOJ&lt;/a&gt; in April last year, I described the above cartoon. I was one of the bloggers. Of course it hurt my feelings, it was intended to, although some people think it was done with irony. I personally don't buy that. YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bloggers don't usually wave their credentials in your face, so you might not be aware that many of us at the DNC in 2004 actually had decent credentials. For example, I had a good education from good schools. At the time I was a research fellow at Harvard. I had spent decades proving myself in my field and had risen to the top. I invented a bunch of technology that were in very wide use, and would form the foundation for all computer networking to come. I had been writing my blog for nine years at that point, and if I do say so myself, was a good writer. We were in the process of starting podcasting at the time. And I was just one of the DNC bloggers. The others were just as accomplished. You had to be someone special to be at the DNC in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A request for ambitious truth-seeking journalists -- stop writing from your fear, learn more about the world. Your blind spots are huge, and are killing us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The impentetrable Shorenstein</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Harvard, when I was a fellow there, one of the members of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/bloggroup/&quot;&gt;Berkman Thursday&lt;/a&gt; group was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_MacKinnon&quot;&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, who was a fellow at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorenstein_Center_on_Media,_Politics_and_Public_Policy&quot;&gt;Shorenstein Center&lt;/a&gt;, which was the rough equivalent of Berkman but for journalists. Previously she had been a CNN reporter from Beijing and Tokyo. Her fellowship was a turning point in her career. She went on to start &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalvoices.org/&quot;&gt;Global Voices&lt;/a&gt;, a blogging network, among other pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She got me together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a former NYT reporter, who was then the director of Shorenstein. To say he was blog-skeptical would be an understatement. He typified all the arrogance and fear of blogging in journalism, with what I saw as false confidence, bravado, I guessed, to try to keep me, and what I represented to him, at arm's length. We probably met just twice, maybe even once. I remember a contentious somewhat friendly conversation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henriettastable.com/&quot;&gt;Henrietta's Table&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I personally asked Jones to come to the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;. He came. I watched him and joined in conversations with him at times. He appeared to be having the time of his life. And why shouldn't he? Here was a room full of sources, people who knew about something he was actually very interested in, and they didn't have to be coerced into talking about it. There was a ton of enthusiasm in the room. They were exploding with ideas, because of the huge potential of this space in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But after the BloggerCon we went back to our corners, staring at each other, unsure of how to communicate. By now &lt;a href=&quot;https://shorensteincenter.org/alex-jones-leave-shorenstein-center-july-1-2015/&quot;&gt;Jones has retired&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicco_Mele&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; is a former famous blogger, the guy who did the blogging at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_for_America&quot;&gt;Dean campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2004/02/07/howardDeanIsNotASoapBar.html&quot;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, really breakthrough stuff, and yet nothing has changed. Shorenstein is still a bastion of professional journalism, and ideas from blogging don't penetrate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should all be working together. I said it then, keep pounding the table, beating the drum. No reason to stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have a bunch of things on my mind ready to go this morning, including the next in a series of &lt;i&gt;voicemailcasts&lt;/i&gt; with Doc Searls, a defense of XML when used as an object serializer, and the awful tendency of techies, esp those who work at Google, to have little respect for stuff that works, always wanting to reinvent without using their supposedly brilliant minds to evaluate their approach, and thereby burning decades of knowhow on a bonfire of geek vanity. Probably a few other things I'm not remembering at the moment.</description>

			<description>Okay first up is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10/daveToDoc.m4a&quot;&gt;26-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt; that follows Doc's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10.html#a145153&quot;&gt;kickoff&lt;/a&gt; of our nascent series. You will feel like you're eavesdropping on a conversation between two old friends, which is totally what it is. I remember the first time I met Doc, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck%27s_of_Woodside&quot;&gt;Buck's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant in Woodside, CA. I also remember very clearly the day in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/11/15.html&quot;&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; I was at his house in Redwood City, helping him get going with his Manila blog, he was one of the very first, and understood blogging in an instant. Doc looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilford_Brimley&quot;&gt;Wilford Brimley&lt;/a&gt;. He got the name Doc because he was a radio personality in North Carolina in the 1970s. He has a radio voice. In this voicemail I talk about Fargo, the masterful FX series. I just watched season 2 and am now working my way through season 3. I talk about my development process for the last decade or so. Very different from the previous 30 years. That's just the beginning. It's a content-rich podcast. Hope you listen and enjoy. Looking forward to Doc's rebut.</description>

You will feel like you're eavesdropping on a conversation between two old friends, which is totally what it is. I remember the first time I met Doc, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck%27s_of_Woodside&quot;&gt;Buck's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant in Woodside, CA. I also remember very clearly the day in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/11/15.html&quot;&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; I was at his house in Redwood City, helping him get going with his Manila blog, he was one of the very first, and understood blogging in an instant. Doc looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilford_Brimley&quot;&gt;Wilford Brimley&lt;/a&gt;. He got the name Doc because he was a radio personality in North Carolina in the 1970s. He has a radio voice. In this voicemail I talk about Fargo, the masterful FX series. I just watched season 2 and am now working my way through season 3. I talk about my development process for the last decade or so. Very different from the previous 30 years. That's just the beginning. It's a content-rich podcast. Hope you listen and enjoy. Looking forward to Doc's rebut." created="Sat, 11 Jan 2020 15:01:40 GMT" type="outline" enclosure="http://scripting.com/2020/01/10/daveToDoc.m4a" enclosureType="audio/mpeg" enclosureLength="13377777" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/11/dots.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/01/11.html#a150140"/>

			<description>It's a fact that XML can be used to serialize complex objects from all kinds of programming languages. I know this because I do it. Have been since 1998. So when a geek says on Twitter that you can't, he or she could get &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1215670988567916546&quot;&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; from me. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1215669583425617920&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; that illustrates. Further, XML and JSON are equivalents as object serializers. I know because I generate both &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; versions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216036119931969536&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for my blog. And as an experiment, my new XML-RPC implementation can use JSON encoding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc#using-json-in-place-of-xml&quot;&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, as an option. Of course there are not many servers that can understand this, so sticking with XML for now is the only practical option. I don't have any love for XML, but I do resent having to lose decades of progress for unrigorous technical thinking. I also don't like debating, anywhere, and especially not on Twitter. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A family story. My mother was a pure capitalist. She believed in hard work, being productive. She felt threatened by evidence of idleness. I drove her crazy. Even as a kid I would sometimes just sit in a chair in the living room of our apartment in Jackson Heights and think. Once she saw me sitting, lights off, no TV, no book, appearing to be doing nothing, and she lost her shit right there. Anyway, many years later, when I sold my company and then it went public, after years of begging me to get a job, her stock in the company was all of a sudden worth a lot of money. It was the only time I remember getting her unqualified approval. She boasted, even when I could hear, that I was profitable. In other words, the money and time she put into raising me made her money. &lt;span style=&quot;opacity: .5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I looked it up, and they are right. And through the rest of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/01.html&quot;&gt;January 2001&lt;/a&gt;, Adam and I were trying out neat hacks that could move large (for the day) audio and video files back and forth between our offices in California and Europe.

			<description>You want to know how bonded Doc and I are. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/11/15.html&quot;&gt;day in 1999&lt;/a&gt; when we got his blog started, I saw he had a blue box in his office. I asked what it is. He didn't really know. I took it home with me, I didn't even ask permission. I realized even at the time this was &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=cheeky&quot;&gt;nervy&lt;/a&gt; of me, but Doc was happy that I did. Turns out it was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_Qube&quot;&gt;Cobalt Qube&lt;/a&gt;, a revolutionary product, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/weLoveOurQube.html&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; that seemed like the future in 1999, but sadly its future has yet to arrive. Hopefully this decade it will. (On second thought maybe it was the precursor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;?)</description>

			<title>Naughton on Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://memex.naughtons.org/archives/2020/01/10/28373&quot;&gt;John Naughton wrote&lt;/a&gt; briefly about the difference between Facebook the company and Facebook the billion-user network. There aren't many people in journalism who see this dichotomy. He wrote to say he had a similar experience on the rail in the UK, viewing the backs of people's houses and wondering what their lives were like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I often do that when travelling by train in the UK in the dark, because British towns always turn their (unadorned, unguarded) backs to the railway while keeping their (brushed and spruced) fronts for the street or the road.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's hard for those of us who predate Facebook to not feel challenged by it and even to reject it. But it is what it is. The open web didn't organize the world, Facebook did. I wish it were otherwise, of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring Facebook as a technology base that we'll build on in the future, would be like refusing to listen to the Beatles in the 60s. You could do it, but if you were a musician or any kind of artist really, you'd be missing a common language that all your users understand. You'd be ignoring an important tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The real platform is the minds of all the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a book I read 30 years ago that opened my eyes to this -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Warfare-Military-Principles-Strategies/dp/0886840821&quot;&gt;Marketing Warfare&lt;/a&gt; by Ries and Trout. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People don't understand this &quot;battleground as the minds of the users&quot; idea is why people don't grok Bloomberg. He really gets it and has the resources to develop all this virgin territory that I'm sure he understands every bit as well as Trump or Murdoch. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Google's crawl-less index</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; asking for clarification of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10.html#a154129&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of yesterday's mini-posts about how Google can index the web without crawling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doc said that Google and Bing are doing an increasingly bad job of archiving the history of the web. When he looks for something he wrote 20 years ago, the search engines can't reliably find it. He also said they're not indexing the current web like they used to. He experiences it thus: Google can't find one of his recent posts, but then after he visits it, presumably in Chrome, it can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From this I conclude:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Google isn't crawling his site. In the past it would check frequently updated pages, such as blogs, every few minutes, for new links. On discovering one, it would read it, add it to their index, and then it would be findable in Google. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But when he visits one of those pages in Chrome, then, a few minutes later it can be found in the search engine. It appears to be using Doc's human behavior to find new pages to index. They can do this now because they have a popular web browser, so they can retire their old method of discovering links and let the users do their crawling. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My own experience. For what it's worth, I've found that Google is still really good at finding my old stuff, as long as there are some good unique words I can search for. If I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22future-safe+archives%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22future-safe+archives%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.9495j0j3&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;future-safe archives&quot; for example, it gives me back a really good set of results. But the other day I was trying to find something I wrote about Obama and his online social net he let dwindle after the 2008 election, and although I believe I wrote about this a number of times, I could only find one piece, by going to the January 2009 archive page and scanning it with my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Caveat: This is all based on tea-leave reading. Neither of us have any insight into what Google is actually doing to maintain its index. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been wanting to bootstrap a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10/docSearlsFutureSafeArchives.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt; for the longest time. When we get together, our conversations are fluid, and full of ideas and stories. In the last few years we've started to exchange voicemails using the iPhone voice memo app. A few days ago I said to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Doc+Searls%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/a&gt;, in a voicemail of course, that we should try to do a podcast that was just a series of voicemails. Nothing more fancy than that. So here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10/docSearlsFutureSafeArchives.m4a&quot;&gt;Doc's first podcast&lt;/a&gt;, to kick things off. He talks about what I call &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+future-safe+archives&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;future-safe archives&lt;/a&gt;. Ideas follow. I think we should &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/151513.html#a153528&quot;&gt;retire domains&lt;/a&gt; the way sports teams retire numbers. We should have a plan for how to preserve the web, not a photograph of the web (that's what archive.org does). BTW, since this podcast is part of scripting.com, it is backed up every night. The original is on Amazon S3, which I think it is the most stable and affordable publicly available storage system. If it didn't exist, I'd be begging them to create it.</description>

			<description>An interesting idea in Doc's &lt;i&gt;voicemailcast, &lt;/i&gt;apparently Google doesn't crawl the web these days, they use the addresses of pages that Chrome users visit. Makes total sense. It's why his pages don't show up in Google search until he goes there. Hadn't thought of this.</description>

			<title>Facebook is not bad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; distribution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; is that I hear directly from readers. Most of the responses are thoughtful and informative, and that's great. But sometimes I receive responses that are neither thoughtful or informative, like the one I received yesterday (author's name withheld so it isn't personal), quoted below.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Just because a billion people do something doesn’t mean the thing they do is good.  Two examples:  smoking tobacco and dumping CO2 into the atmosphere. Facebook use is undercutting democracy around the world.  It’s not getting better.  We need something like Wikipedia but in the Facebook arena.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, this was not written by a journalist, but it could have been. It's more or less the party line among journalists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second, I am a former smoker, and it was definitely damaging my health, a cardiologist who had just operated on my heart said so. I stopped, and believe I am healthier as a result. I am still alive, and that's something. But I have to say there were positive things about smoking. I won't go into them here and now, I just want to say that they exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Third, the correspondent is indulging in a logical falacy. It's true some popular things are bad, but that doesn't mean all popular things are bad, nor are all bad things bad in all ways. His second example &quot;dumping CO2 into the atmosphere&quot; is bad, but driving cars is often good. An ambulance that saves someone's life is dumping CO2 into the atmosphere. Later today I'm going to drive to get groceries. That's good. I use electricity to heat my house. On a cold night, where the temperature can go down into the teens, believe me &lt;i&gt;that's good. &lt;/i&gt;And to get the heat I am dumping CO2 into the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As someone who uses Facebook, let me testify that many of the things that happen there are good, unique, empowering and fun -- things I wouldn't want to live without. These things are certainly worth &lt;i&gt;understanding&lt;/i&gt; before dismissing the whole medium. You can learn from something you don't like. A billion people doing something raises the question &quot;What are they doing?&quot; We should aspire to not dismiss before understanding, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A little unsolicited advice. Don't be so rigid. If someone you respect says something is worth doing, if you dismiss it with a generalization you can't prove, you're missing something, and probably not just in this area. Living a creative and interesting life imho requires considering possibilities you might have rejected without much consideration, stepping outside your comfort zone. Keep an open mind. Challenge your assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays when you go to a baseball game there is never a moment when the PA system shuts up so you can talk about the game with your friends. This used to be one of the nicest things about going to a live game. The shared experience. Now they play commercials every minute that baseball isn't being played. On top of the $100 you paid for the seat. We are coerced into singing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMdkcTmPS2U&quot;&gt;God Bless America&lt;/a&gt;, a truly awful song, instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4-gsdLSSQ0&quot;&gt;Take Me Out To the Ballgame&lt;/a&gt;, as a form of weak patriotism (weak because if they understood America, they'd realize that forcing people to pray to your god is about as un-American as it gets). We have to rise to thank the troops who protect our freedom in Afghanistan, even if you don't believe that's what's going on. That's the world that Facebook exists in. So if you don't like the commercialism of Facebook, the lies that advertisers tell, you should have the same feeling about America's national pastime. And Facebook isn't nearly that bad, btw. And some very good things happen there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Let me tell you a little story. When I was 14, I went to high school in the Bronx and lived in Queens. It was a 1.5 hour trip each way. I had a few choices but they all magically took the same amount of time. One of the routes was to take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+St,+Flushing,+NY+11358/Main+St+%26+Roosevelt+Avenue,+Queens,+Queens+County,+NY/@40.7655943,-73.8268099,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a80780e9c3b:0xa8668e9b256999a4!2m2!1d-73.794882!2d40.769637!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c26011d8a8638d:0x3a7a296f0fbc67fc!2m2!1d-73.8301324!2d40.7595662!3e3&quot;&gt;Q16 bus to Main Street&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Main+St+%26+Roosevelt+Avenue,+Queens,+Queens+County,+NY/Grand+Central+Terminal,+East+42nd+Street,+New+York,+NY/@40.7522944,-73.9738374,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c26011d8a8638d:0x3a7a296f0fbc67fc!2m2!1d-73.8301324!2d40.7595662!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a21fb011c85:0x37513b7f1821408b!2m2!1d-73.9772294!2d40.7527262!3e3&quot;&gt;7 train to Grand Central&lt;/a&gt;, and switch to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Grand+Central+Terminal,+East+42nd+Street,+New+York,+NY/The+Bronx+High+School+of+Science,+West+205th+Street,+The+Bronx,+NY/@40.8192919,-73.9978298,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a21fb011c85:0x37513b7f1821408b!2m2!1d-73.9772294!2d40.7527262!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f39fba19f047:0x456fa7ab9f9bae18!2m2!1d-73.890843!2d40.8783054!3e3&quot;&gt;4 train uptown&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Park_Boulevard%E2%80%93Lehman_College_station&quot;&gt;Bedford Park Blvd station&lt;/a&gt; is two blocks from the school. One day on the train, I remember this really clearly, I was watching all the houses and apartment buildings we passed, first in Queens, then in the Bronx. Inside every window, I guessed, was a family, like my own, possibly. With their dramas and struggles, stories, victories, history, abuse, happiness, fear. I tried to imagine how each of them might live and realized in an overwhelming way that I could never begin to understand who they were. NYC, even then, was an ethnically and economically diverse place. Of course as we traveled through the city, the people on the train changed too. Very few of them were Bronx Science students. There were all kinds of people. Who knew what any of them were thinking. The point is this. The world is huge. To keep our sanity we have to simplify it, and to do that we have to ignore differences. The stories we tell ourselves little connection to reality. And so any general statement about a community as huge and diverse as Facebook is certain to miss the mark, widely. And most of what we read only focuses on the company, not the users. To have that appear as journalism is just wrong because journalism has a higher calling, to find out what's real, what's true, and then say that.</description>

			<title>Candidate Bloomberg</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of pieces just floated through my river. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/michael-bloomberg-president-democrats-beat-trump.html&quot;&gt;Nominating Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; for President Isn’t a Crazy Idea &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1215301568972632070&quot;&gt;Biden, Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; have largest leads against Trump in Michigan poll&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Amazing. And Bloomberg is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What people (mostly journos) overlook with Bloomberg is that he has mastered two very important things for a presidential candidate:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Media&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tech&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think about who he is and how he thinks and how he made his fortune. A presidential campaign is not that different from his news org. In a way it's as if Steve Jobs didn't die, left Apple again, was mayor of NYC for 12 years, took some time off, made some more money and then decided to run for president. Bloomberg has mastered media and tech as much as Jobs ever did. Very different styles, but similar levels of accomplishment. Do not underestimate Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nominating Bloomberg is not a crazy idea. He's a good fit for the country. A nice rebound from Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A diverse &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pilhofer/status/1214916712417636352&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter about judging Facebook. For me, a re-hash of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/03/214302.html?title=whenWeTalkAboutFacebook&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote on January 3, about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1214966166512427010&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook, and how the the story you hear most in journalism ignores the billion or so people who use Facebook and focuses on how they feel about the company. I've yet to see an act of journalism that didn't flaunt their conflict of interest. In the thread, Facebook has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1214979702810697731&quot;&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; to a supermarket, NBC and Times Square. It is none of those things, it's much much bigger. It's a community of a billion or more users, and is as diverse as those people are. Most people in my experience have good intentions, and that's true on Facebook. Even the ones who aren't nice, are probably just struggling with something. I'd like to see a few journalists adopt the point of view that Facebook is not a simple place, can't be reduced to  good or evil, isn't a product of one or two peoples' personalities, that it's made up of an incomprehensibly huge group of people, from everywhere.</description>

			<description>In 1996, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;wrote a story&lt;/a&gt; for Upside, a dream really. I dreamt I was the CEO of Apple. Before Steve came back. I would buy a song, and make a new computer and drop the rest, and focus on getting developers to ship new products. Not all that different from what Steve did when he came back, except the part about developers. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Yesterday when I posted the instructions for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/06/153015.html?title=sharingOnFacebook&quot;&gt;how to share&lt;/a&gt; one of my blog posts to Facebook, in addition to trying to help a friend, I wanted to see for myself what the instructions would look like, in writing, without too much detail and without any steps omitted. The moral of the story is this. Come on Facebook, re-join the open web. Let's make it easy for people to do their writing outside Facebook for sharing inside. Let's make the wall of your silo so permeable that it ceases to be a silo. On Twitter I was asked why I keep beating this drum when it seems so unlikely that Facebook cares. I do it because I want to create a historic record, this has always been a big part of my blogging. I want to remember what sharing across silo walls was like in 2020. Maybe we'll look back and marvel that it was once this convoluted. Or maybe we'll marvel that it could be done at all. No one knows. But part of the reason I blog is to create a record. That's why I care so much about &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;bigco's&lt;/a&gt; trying to erase that record for selfish reasons.</description>

			<description>I appreciate the shout out yesterday from &lt;a href=&quot;https://evhead.com/autocompletely-5a29de03581b&quot;&gt;Evan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, a former competitor who has gone on to make billions as co-founder of Twitter. It's nice that he still reads my blog, even though I have said some critical things about Medium, but all in the spirit of trying to make the web work better. Hope they have been received that way. I learned from reading his post that he has moved to New York. I think that's a good move, from San Francisco, which as a born-and-bred NYer has always seemed really small to me. Of course I've now moved to a much much smaller place. Anyway Ev if you're reading this, thanks for the kind words. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A lot of people I knew years ago who have gone on to great success are keeping their distance. I wish they wouldn't. I have had my own experience with success, having been part of a tech IPO in the 80s, and creating a bunch of the tech in the 90s and 00s that we take for granted today. Some people may think I'm poor. I am not. The stock and real estate markets have made it pretty easy to build on a modest nest egg. But our humanity is so much more important than the ways we measure success and influence. Ultimately, no matter how rich any of us are, we don't really attain the influence we feel we deserve. I've learned that from burying two parents, both of whom had very strong opinions. Today, years after they are gone, well, no one really cares about what they thought. I care about them as my parents, the people who raised and cared for me, and I care about their struggles and accomplishments insofar as it was central to who they were. But their influence now is nil, and sadly, it was probably pretty close to that when they were alive. That's reality. So if we enjoyed each others' company before, if we learned from each other in the past, your great success shouldn't matter, it shouldn't be a barrier to more fun.</description>

			<title>Charley Hustle and the Hall of Fame</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/sports/basketball/nets-kyrie-irving-shoulder-injury-surgery.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss&quot;&gt;Kyrie Irving says&lt;/a&gt; he may need shoulder surgery. As you may know I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/26/172803.html&quot;&gt;not a huge fan&lt;/a&gt; of his. NY didn't need him. And it's obvious he didn't really want to play for the Nets or in NY, he wanted to play with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant&quot;&gt;KD&lt;/a&gt;. And until KD his healed, Kyrie would prefer to sit on the sideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reminds me that the other day I saw a comment about Pete Rose and how he belongs in the Hall of Fame, and I couldn't agree more. For so many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1213879234185302017&quot;&gt;Statistically&lt;/a&gt; it's a no-brainer. He has more hits, more singles, more at-bats, more games played, more outs than any other player in MLB history. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt; before there was Moneyball. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/11/whitey-ford-gave-pete-rose-his-charlie-hustle-nickname/&quot;&gt;Charlie Hustle&lt;/a&gt;. Who else would dive &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/07/charlieHustle.png&quot;&gt;head-first&lt;/a&gt; into second with no helmet? Is he even wearing gloves? Hard to tell. He should be in the Hall of Fame for this alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Charley Hustle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I said all that. And Alan Cooper who I know to otherwise be a reasonable person, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MrAlanCooper/status/1213879931416936449&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; if I would pardon Jeffrey Epstein (enslaver and sexual violator of children) or Nixon (defiler of the Constitution) because I would forgive Pete Rose for betting on his own team. I responded to Cooper that there is an obvious difference between Pete Rose and the others, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1213926736641044485&quot;&gt;sports&lt;/a&gt;. In sports we get to be judgmental assholes. You may hate Pete Rose, I love him. I loved him as a kid, because he taught me what passion was. It makes total sense to me that a man like that, too old to play the game himself, would indulge in gambling on the game, even when it was against the rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are too intolerant of different points of view on social networks. But I refuse to give up the last bastion of intolerant assholery and political incorrectness -- sports. So I'll keep on loving Pete Rose and you can keep hating him, and life goes on. No one is the worse for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- in tech, where both Alan and I come from, we bet on our own teams all the time. It's the norm. We give people the means to bet themselves, hoping it'll motivate them. Even in sports there are performance incentives. Players are given bonuses if they achieve a specific stat, or their team makes the playoffs. I could see being pissed if a manager bet &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; their team, but betting in favor the team? I don't know, but I just don't see the problem. In any case, he's going to be in the HoF when he's dead. Let him enjoy the acceptance and love now. Inside that old body is Charlie Hustle, let him in, if not for him, for the kids he inspired.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The thing that was so frustrating about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/amp/article/156096/death-good-internet-inside-job-decade-hell&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; from Jason Linkins in the New Republic is that he is the kind of user we need on the open web. They see it as we deserted them, but as a developer who needs smart driven creative and friendly users, when you guys left, and decided to pour your brilliance into Twitter and Facebook instead, you helped drive the downward spiral. &lt;i&gt;Users matter. &lt;/i&gt;That's the thing I've never been able to communicate to users. Stop being sheep. Choose. It may be a little harder, you may have to give up some features at first, but if you support a creative individual developer, you could be amazed at the new power they can and will create for you. Work with developers who make tools you like. Help them.</description>

			<description>Postscript on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/05/175213.html&quot;&gt;email outage&lt;/a&gt;. Problem solved. The mails went out last night. A perfect programming job for a Sunday. Correctly sized up the problem, determined the solution, implemented and tested all within a couple of hours, in time to take a walk and then watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-marcus-morris-rj-barrett-paul-george-kawhi-leonard-la-clippers-20200105-mqwpur4yancmhm5qhgypicfs7a-story.html&quot;&gt;the Knicks lose&lt;/a&gt; to the Clippers, and started reading a new excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Fell_to_Earth_(novel)&quot;&gt;science fiction novel&lt;/a&gt; chosen from a list I can't find now. Today, the first day back to work in the New Year, I have no idea what to work on next. I'm going to look for something small and self-contained. I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/mail#readme&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; the previously undocumented package, so maybe someone else will benefit from the work.</description>

			<description>Sometimes on FB people say the kind of stuff you hear on CNN from opinioneers whose job it is to say something even when there isn't anything to say. You listen to these people, and it's just a word salad of non-sentences that have absolutely no meaning. Then the host that you somewhat admire (e.g. Tapper, Melber) says that's an excellent point, Pete or that gets you thinking Gloria, and you realize they're just filling time with words that really have no meaning, and you're just wasting your time, you could learn more watching a Law &amp; Order rerun for the 18th time. At least they're getting paid to do it. But on FB, there's just no call for it.</description>

			<title>Sharing on Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/howardweaver&quot;&gt;Howard Weaver&lt;/a&gt; asked how to share a post from Scripting News to Facebook. These days this is how I do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in its own browser window. This makes it easier to go back and forth, which we're going to have to do several times. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on the purple pound sign to the right of the post you want to share. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Take a screen shot of the post. Here's how I do it on the Mac. Press Cmd-Shift-4, to go into Screen Shot mode. You can let up the keys after pressing them. Move the mouse to the upper left corner of the area you want to copy, click and hold, then drag to the lower right corner and let up the mouse. The screen shot is now on the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open Facebook in another window. Navigate to the place you want to drop the shared post. Click in the text box, and press Cmd-V (on the Mac) to paste the screen shot. Do not submit the post yet, there's more to do.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Go back to the browser window with the Scripting News post, click in the address bar. Cmd-A if necessary to select the whole address and copy it to the clipboard (Cmd-C). Switch back into Facebook and paste the address into the message. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One more time, go back to the post and select a provocative phrase or sentence from the post. Something that'll catch the readers' interest. Select, Copy, switch into Facebook, Paste. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now you're ready to post. Review what's there to make sure everything is as you'd like it and then click the Post button. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Of course I shared this post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1128171360723601&amp;set=a.113966572144090&amp;type=3&amp;theater&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Iran has the kind of opportunity the US had after 9/11. We had the whole world behind us. Had we shown restraint, we could have cemented our &quot;sole superpower&quot; status. Instead of spending trillions on unwinnable wars, we could have put that money into infrastructure. Rebuilt our school system. By now those kids would be in the workforce, kicking ass competitively. We would be solving problems. Amazingly Iran is in a similar place now. The US is the bad guy, the terrorist, with an unprovoked attack of apparently similar scale as the terrorist attacks of 9/11. In addition to helping Iran, it would help the people of the United States to get our country off the insane path it's on. By not responding, you deprive Trump of an enemy, and win the support of the world, including in the US. This is how the world wins.</description>
