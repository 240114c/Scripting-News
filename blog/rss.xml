			<description>This week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/profits-or-people/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; is worth a listen. The economics of Coronavirus. They breezed by a huge issue. Millions of Americans without health insurance, no savings, no job, sick, homeless, hungry, plus guns. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/21.html#a011845&quot;&gt;ticking time bomb&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about briefly on March 21. The so-called stimulus Congress passed, what a joke, does nothing to address this. I would much preferred see the $2 trillion give everyone the health care they need, keep us all fed, and reboot the economy around serving the people of the country. The UK did this, by guaranteeing 80% of people's salaries for the duration. They already have a national health care system. We are headed for a big crash. Congress didn't deal with it.</description>

			<description>I don't feel good about this. I was glad to hear Boris Johnson got the CV, not because I hold anything against him, but if he can get it so can Trump. And I think that would be good for Americans who are scared out of our minds about this disease esp because our president is not.</description>

			<description>If our country is to have strong national borders, we need a uniform lockdown policy across the whole country. Or else we have to form federations of states with identical policies. This is starting to happen in the northeast, btw.</description>

			<description>The UK is getting its act together, after a bad start, meanwhile in the United States we know what to do, but can’t get our president to stop sulking. If he wants everyone to get back to work, he should set the example. Quit crying and do your job or get out of the way.</description>

			<description>Why America is so bad at Covid-19. It’s our attitude, there are never consequences for Americans. That’s for other people. We have wars and tax cuts at the same time. We don’t see the coffins of our returning dead. Nothing happens to us. We can’t imagine things not being normal. The generation that grew up during World War II, who experienced the Holocaust, the advent of nuclear weapons, that generation is gone now. Everyone alive today, not just boomers, have been spoiled. We're all coming awake now from a life-long trance. For the first time in our lives, we have to deal with the mortality of our country. Don't cry for America. It's time to grow up, again. Couldn't have a more perfect person as president. It's easy to see he is our past. Now how do we move beyond that.</description>

			<description>I read in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/phones-track-spread-covid19-good-idea/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about China and South Korea how they relied on location data from people's phones to know where contagious people had been. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/20.html#a141448&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; had to install one of these apps before they'd let her enter the country, just to switch planes. I'm guessing that in the US we can't use that data even though companies like Google, Apple and Facebook have it. The context has changed, and now trillions of dollars are at stake, the existence of our economy, our lives (hope that's not too dramatic). Perhaps it's time to re-think our assumptions.</description>

			<source:outline text="I read in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/phones-track-spread-covid19-good-idea/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about China and South Korea how they relied on location data from people's phones to know where contagious people had been. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/20.html#a141448&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; had to install one of these apps before they'd let her enter the country, just to switch planes. I'm guessing that in the US we can't use that data even though companies like Google, Apple and Facebook have it. The context has changed, and now trillions of dollars are at stake, the existence of our economy, our lives (hope that's not too dramatic). Perhaps it's time to re-think our assumptions." created="Mon, 23 Mar 2020 15:42:11 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/23/southKoreaFlag.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/23.html#a154211"/>

			<description>I have a rule. No online debates. Here's a reason why. Even with friends there could be a basic disconnect early in the discussion. If it's done in voice, you can hear that. In text you might not hear it until you've gone back four or five times. Feelings get hurt.</description>
