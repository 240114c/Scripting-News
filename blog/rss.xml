			<title>The Irishman, with spoilers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My mini &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-irishman&quot;&gt;Irishman&lt;/a&gt; review.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese&quot;&gt;Scorsese&lt;/a&gt; has a style, you can see it in the first scene of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/27.html#a195050&quot;&gt;The Irishman&lt;/a&gt;, and you smile, not knowing what's coming next, but knowing it's going to be good. The camera snakes through a nursing home and finds our narrator, an ancient Robert De Niro, and the story begins.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They do some fancy CGI stuff to show the characters much younger than the actors are today, but it doesn't work. I was thinking about that all through the movie. How old they are now, the staples of a Scorsese gangland movie, De Niro (76), Pesci (76) and one who's not a staple but also ancient, Pacino (79). And how old are they supposed to be in the scene I'm watching now. It was never clear. And the young CGI version of De Niro looks really old and doesn't look like De Niro. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It could have been more emotional, gripping and surprising, as good as any of his films, if he had used new actors. The CGI tricks stole the show and not in a good way, imho. I think that's why The Departed really clicked. None of the usual Scorsese ensemble, the stars were Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Vera Farmiga, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin. They played characters their own age. The story and storytelling took over, I never once thought about the movie-making, was completely captivated by the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; watch The Irishman. Even a not-so-great Scorsese movie is epic and historic, especially with this cast, and especially at this point in all their careers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NBA in NYC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is decidedly not a Thanksgiving post. Maybe I should hold it for tomorrow, but that's not how I roll. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched a game between the LA Clippers and the Dallas Mavericks yesterday. They're both really good teams &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/28/standingsWestNba.png&quot;&gt;doing well&lt;/a&gt; this year. Watching the Clippers specifically it's sad for me, a Knicks fan, to see that LA has two highly competitive NBA teams and New York has part of one. We did attract two stars to NYC in the off-season, but one of them is injured and won't play all year, and the other is an asshole whose attitude spoils any hope we might have for interesting basketball in NYC this year and into the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The asshole of course is Kyrie Irving. If he were a true leader, he'd come to NYC and say hey I'm from here too, and I think it sucks that the city has such shitty basketball. I'm going to do my part to help liven things up, and hopefully the Nets will have a good year (set expectations, show a bit of humility, it works) and maybe we can inspire something interesting to happen on the other side of the river (i.e. at the Knicks).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's so sucky that the biggest market in the US doesn't have a decent team and Dallas, a very random place for basketball, has a good team. Houston also has a great team, and San Antonio, even though they're rebuilding, is ok. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how much longer the NBA will put up with a Knicks owner who has no clue about sports, about the city, for that matter, about people. The Knicks need an intervention. Knicks fans are patient, but the city deserves better from the NBA. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This year's Knicks are actually, for the Knicks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/11/27/knicks-completely-destroyed-by-dominant-raptors/&quot;&gt;pretty good&lt;/a&gt;. They're still however in last place in the East, and only 1/2 game better than the worst in the West, the Warriors, and that's another story I want to tell someday.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I saw a thing on CNN how Trump is using Facebook ads to refute bad news on TV. You wouldn't know if you (like me) are not in his base. They showed a graph with the money spent by various Democrats on FB ads. In total it's small fraction of what Trump is spending. Now I think about Bloomberg's entry into the race in a whole new way. Not only is he rich, and can afford to spend a lot on ads, he also understands tech and media. That's how he made his billions. So when people count him out based on today's polling, they're getting caught in horse-race thinking and forgetting to look at the horse itself. He won't be afraid to use Facebook. He'll have some catching up to do, but he has a mind for tech media and lots of unique experience. Trump should be concerned.</description>

			<description>Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1199777312054493184&quot;&gt;clarifies&lt;/a&gt; its inactive account policy.

Twitter accounts are websites, we point to them and include them, as I point to the new Twitter policy above. Jack was around when the web was very young. The idea is that we're creating a record. It's not ephemeral. It should survive us. It shouldn't matter if a site is active. Now we know that &lt;i&gt;users care&lt;/i&gt; about preserving the web. Twitter is part of that.</description>

			<description>For 3+ years reporters won't cross the line re Trump and Russia. Every story ends with the same puzzle. Why does Trump love Russia? We don't know. We just don't know. It's like the line in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Harry_Met_Sally...&quot;&gt;Harry Met Sally&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55VPeDVxsrg&quot;&gt;Carrie Fisher&lt;/a&gt; says &quot;He'll never leave her, I know, I know he'll never leave her.&quot; Everyone says it at some point. We can recite it along with them. &quot;No one thinks he'll ever leave her,&quot; says Meg Ryan. At some point you hope she gets the clue. Everyone but the reporters knows why Trump loves Russia. At some point it would be useful if the reporters would just use it in their reporting.</description>

			<description>Everything is subject to humor. Yes there must be lines, don't joke about things people have no control over, as in body shaming. But if we can't laugh at ourselves and our foibles, well what's the point of living. We are really small and live infinitesimally short lives. That's the big joke connecting all the individual ones. We don't really matter in the end. If you've ever had someone you're close to die, you know that truth. We're only here for the moment, so &lt;i&gt;let's have fun. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning coffee fans!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something I used to do in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22morning+coffee+notes%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt; of the blog. When I started work in the morning, I'd create a section for the first notes of the day. It's nice because it leaves room at the top of the page as the day goes on, and I don't have to shuffle the morning stuff off to new places.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Morning Coffee Notes was also the name of &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;my first podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in the summer of 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Want to see and hear my first podcast? Scroll down to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/26/mcnFirst.png&quot;&gt;6/11/2004&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later that year I started another podcast with Adam Curry called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22trade+secrets%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Trade Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. It was a cool name for a podcast, It would be cool even today with the glut of podcasts because it's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre&quot;&gt;double entendre&lt;/a&gt;, and inviting if you're into secrets that are traded. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I forgot why I started today's MCN section. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll catch up on my next coding break. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm moving apps from an old server where Dropbox stopped working to another old server where Dropbox still works. It's like taking apart a robot and putting it back together. Lots of wires to hook up. And just getting the old pieces off the old server without Dropbox was a pain the ass. Lots of chances for mistakes. I really need to make this kind of thing easy. I know just use containers. But it's at the next level up where I need more factoring and abstraction.</description>

			<title>Holiday season binge-o-rama</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's the best time of year for binge-watching. I'm up to date on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. As far as I'm concerned they could stop right here at episode 7. Best season &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Mr+Robot%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;. But there are still six more episodes in the series. Now I'm working my way through the third season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt;. Another tour de force. Waiting in the wings is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Man in the High Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt;, which is fantastic even though it got &lt;s&gt;awful&lt;/s&gt; mixed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. I only watched the first three episodes, the ones that were released when AppleTV+ came out. I want to wait until the season is done so I can watch it in a binge. I'm not a big fan of waiting a week between episodes. I'm a fairly modal person in most things I do and TV is certainly one of them. I also know a few people who are just now catching up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Succession&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;. Can't wait to hear what they think. No spoilers. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- the reason &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; got bad reviews is that it isn't what a newsroom really is like. Because presumably the reviewers know what newsrooms are like. The rest of us don't. We loved &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; even though it was nothing like working in the White House. Dramas depend not on the reality of what they portray, rather the ability of the writers, actors and technical people to tell a story that pulls you in, gets you to care, makes you forget you aren't in their world instead of your own. They become your friends, and you develop an intimacy you can't get with your real friends and family. That's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; is so good. The writing, acting, and everything else are done by people who know how to get you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; you want to go. Whether it resembles the way newsrooms work, the only people who care about that are reviewers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also -- one of the great things about Mr Robot is that the writers understand how software works. They do take shortcuts and at time make word salads of tech jargon, but most of it is about things that hackers would really do and use. One thing they gloss over is bugs. Elliot and Darlene's code always works the first time. They never get so much as a syntax error. I'm waiting for the next generation shows where the plot revolves around a platform vendor removing a feature that the firewall depended on and the hackers figure it out and Evil-Corp crumbles and the Dark Army takes over or someone worse than Trump ends up running the country. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1198188964278079488&quot;&gt;Democratic impeachment strategy&lt;/a&gt;: House hearings continue indefinitely, until Senate agrees to remove president. Explore every nook and cranny of Republican corruption. Target Repub senators up for re-election in 2020. Draft articles of impeachment are posted publicly and kept current, registered voters can vote individual articles up or down. A full week of hearings on why Republicans are repeating Russian talking points. How about the July 4 visit to Moscow by senators. Why are Repubs so beholden to Putin? What happened in Helsinki? So many questions. Letâ€™s get the answers.</description>

			<description>Occam's Razor says if you want to grok the hows and whys of the Republican Party,  look at how the political system of Russia works. Why do the members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assembly_(Russia)&quot;&gt;Russian legislature&lt;/a&gt; do whatever Putin wants? That's why the Repubs do what Trump wants.</description>

			<title>UPS no longer delivers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Living in the country, as I do, I order a lot of stuff on Amazon. The nearest department store is about 40 minutes away and it's a Walmart, not exactly my favorite place to shop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the last week the UPS driver on my route decided not to deliver to my house. The reason keeps changing, but it seems there's nothing I can do about it, so I gave up. I asked the UPS people in Kingston to return the packages to Amazon. I expect Amazon will refund the purchase price. They're usually pretty good with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are no Amazon lockers nearby. But UPS has a relationship with the hardware store in town (8 minutes from my house). That's going to be my next approach. To see if there's a way for UPS to deliver my packages to the store. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And while the UPS people I've talked with have been professional overall this leaves a really bad feeling here for UPS. One day they deliver to your house and the next day they don't. Whatever the reason (it keeps changing) it's not cool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just had a freaking nightmarish development experience. I was moving an app on a server, and the address of the server was hard-coded in an Electron app I use. I figured when it changed, I could just edit the source and rebuild. I know everything should be an option, but this was just for me. But when I rebuilt it, Electron would have &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of it. So much deprecation. So I ended up on a trail of tears having to update one thing after another, and they all refused to work with something else that had just changed. Platform developers, stability is something we should rate you on and you should get paid accordingly. Typically it's highly paid developers at BigCo's who feel entitled to pull the rugs out from under our apps and tear up the pavement just for the hell of it. Oy oy. Two oys. But shit I'm good at taking the punches, and now it's running. Whew. Back to work on fun stuff.</description>

			<description>People should simply use their names in the space where you put your name in a tweet. After a couple of years of playing with it, I find it's confusing to put messages there. An example.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dweinberger&quot;&gt;David Weinberger&lt;/a&gt; is someone I would read every &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/22/tweetexample.png&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; of, but sometimes miss because he's endlessly creative with his twitter name. I believe this is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/cognitive-overload&quot;&gt;cognitive overload&lt;/a&gt;. My brain screams &quot;too much&quot; and I move on to the next tweet.</description>

			<description>A long time ago I was having lunch with someone I thought was a friend. He told a story about how he tried to buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt;, a product I developed, from the company that owned it. I guess at the time he didn't know that I still owned a majority share of the company. The people who were running it never brought the idea to me. I asked why he didn't just try to work with me. I would have totally been open to the idea. He explained he wanted to own it. I've seen this happen over and over. People who build careers with products that are copies of stuff I had already done. I keep wondering why we couldn't work together. They do it in other creative fields. I just got caught up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. I picked the right moment to do it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=rm+robot+season+4+episode+7&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;S04 E07&lt;/a&gt; was a total masterpeice and a big reveal. Look at all the talent that had to come together to make that happen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tracks.ranea.org/post/35606102112/mistitled-andrew-singer-rip&quot;&gt;Andrew Singer&lt;/a&gt; a former colleague said once that in tech we don't stand on the shoulders of giants, we stand on their toes.

			<description>American journalism is never far from falling back to the horse race in everything. Who the hell knows or cares how many senators will ultimately vote to remove. It's impossible to know, or even if the vote will ever happen. Waste of time to speculate. And it isn't even up to the senators, it's up to the voters. The senators will vote to remove if it means they feel they will lose their election.</description>

			<description>&quot;The Three Amigos&quot; is now part of American political folklore after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/live-blog/nov-20-impeachment-hearings-live-updates-n1086301/ncrd1086906#liveBlogHeader&quot;&gt;Sondland said&lt;/a&gt; he was proud to be an amigo. You can say you were there when this happened. Also this scandal doesn't have a short name, like Watergate, Iran-Contra. I guess the Clinton impeachment didn't get a name either.</description>

			<description>Sorry for the sparse updates here. I'm overloaded, watching the impeachment hearings and at the same time dealing with a server that Dropbox fails on. Moving these apps to a new server is tricky. On Digital Ocean.</description>
