			<description>Updated: &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/scriptingNews/nightlyArchive.opml&quot;&gt;How I archive Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Iâ€™ve been backing up my blog to a GitHub repository for the last year. The idea is that the content of my blog should exist even if &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;  were to disappear. The process is now documented, hoping to leave clues for future historians.</description>

			<description>I like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/09/04/644418160/colin-kaepernick-is-chosen-for-nikes-anniversary-just-do-it-campaign&quot;&gt;Nike did&lt;/a&gt; by using Colin Kaepernick as a model. I think this is possibly a cleansing process. It'll force people to look at what exactly it is they're against. Whether Kaepernick might be a patriot and not a pariah.</description>

			<title>Democratic priorities for the fall</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Campaign season starts today. Here are the priorities as I see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Campaign on oversight&lt;/b&gt;. The reason the Dems must take back at least one chamber of Congress is then they can do oversight of the Trump Administration. Subpoenas and hearings to investigate how the cash flows between Trump and foreign entities, not just Russia.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concerts/rallies&lt;/b&gt;. The Dems have completely ceded the ongoing entertainment campaign to Trump. His rallies are more like concerts, with a single comedian. He's a cross between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers&quot;&gt;Joan RIvers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt;. He's good but he's not that good. The Dems have the best comedians and musicians. They even have politicians who can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3eC35LoF4U&quot;&gt;burn down the house&lt;/a&gt;. Every Trump rally should be programmed against, provided for free to all the networks. Gradually push him off the air.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starve the troll&lt;/b&gt;. He gets around the media and goes direct. This of course imho is a good trend long-term because it forces the media to become part of the people and vice versa. But in the immediate term, he controls discourse, he keeps the focus on himself, exclusively. Block the troll. And unfollow people who RT him, no matter how much you value their other contributions. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/22/151134.html&quot;&gt;trolls die in darkness&lt;/a&gt;, and that's a good thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Impeachment is an issue for the voters, not the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Impeachment as a goal is like starting a football game saying your strategy is to score a touchdown. We must focus on rebooting our democracy. We not only have to think about the danger of Trump in the White House, we have to set our country back on its previous course. It was flawed, but at least we had a semblance of the rule of law. Impeachment isn't itself an answer. When the time is right, when there's overwhelming support for impeachment &lt;i&gt;and removal&lt;/i&gt; among the people, then and only then will it be the next thing to do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Avenatti works because while he cares how he's covered by the press, he doesn't follow their rules. The other Dems follow the rules. Hillary was the worst. So they could get her on her &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/02/butHerEmailsBig.png&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt;, not because there was any substance, rather because she was &quot;defensive.&quot; They criticized her for following their rules. Heh. Break out, there's no penalty for doing so.</description>

			<description>One of my basic rules of discourse is to never tell another person to shut up as long as I can easily stop listening. And the converse, if someone tells me to shut up, or implies it, they're wrong, and I don't argue with them. But I have an exception to the rule. If a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; is destroying a community and people engage with the troll, I will tell them to stop, and explain, as lovingly as I can, that they're as much a part of the problem as the troll is. There is no excuse for engaging with a troll.</description>

			<description>That was quite a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC08_cYeGHw&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; by Obama. It's the kind of speech McCain might have made, but it says more that Obama said it at McCain's request. The very last thing said about McCain before being buried.</description>

			<description>Emails like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/01/moreDisgustingEmailFromGoogle.png&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; from Google about &quot;violations&quot; on my website are really disturbing, esp since I don't run any Google ads on my site. I wish they'd STFU about violations, or say what the violations are. I always can use a good laugh. Their email is a violation of my independence. Fuck off.</description>

			<title>Tech booms</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The big boom in tech is never what the pundits say it will be. They generally go for the wizzy demo, but what wins is usually more cerebral and prosaic, has more to do with human potential than domination.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like the cameras in phones. Few pundits called that. It wasnâ€™t spacy and hard to understand. Instead  cameras got smaller, better, and key thing â€” could communicate without tethering.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Few predicted that radio was ripe to be democratized, but thatâ€™s what we did. Not VR or AR. Imagine how much money has poured into those. New media types are the simple obvious ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Different kinds of archives</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/31.html&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; we heard that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.villagevoice.com/&quot;&gt;Village Voice&lt;/a&gt; is ending, but they are sticking around long enough to be sure their archive is accessible for historic purposes. This is much appreciated by all who value the Voice, its history, and the human knowledge it represents. As far as I know, it's the first time a news organization, or a blog, when shutting down, has put effort into assuring the archive remains accessible. (If there are other examples, I'd like to hear about them.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So then the question is, what kind of archive? I'll try to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine the difference between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/things-to-do/rome-s-ruins&quot;&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; of ancient &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum&quot;&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, and a museum filled with artifacts from that time. In the actual ruin, you're standing where the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Romans&quot;&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt; of Roman history stood. There's more data available to you, things a museum curator might not think to preserve.  It also invokes the imagination and inspires in ways a museum can't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's also great value in museums and libraries! Sometimes the things that were created are more important. So you can visit the US Capitol (a place) in Washington DC, or see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration&quot;&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt; (a document) at the National Archives.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d187555-r376233744-The_British_Museum-London_England.html&quot;&gt;handwritten lyrics&lt;/a&gt; of Eleanor Rigby by Lennon and McCartney at the British Museum, but the Beatles are no longer performing the song. When the thing itself no longer exists, it's good to have the artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You want it all if you really care about the history.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As it is with the web. Most of the content of the Village Voice is probably already safely &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.villagevoice.com/&quot;&gt;stored&lt;/a&gt; at archive.org. But what about the villagevoice.com domain? Don't we also want to preserve the links into the site, for ongoing web sites that point to the Voice? Or when someone reads the preserved Scripting News, if I'm able to get that done, be able to click a link to a great Voice article and not get a 404? That's analogous to preserving ancient Rome in addition to remembering its history. (BTW, some of it's already gone. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/03.html#When:2:56:16AM&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on this blog from 2004 that links to a VV article. Not found. Ouch.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the web we have the technical means to create a perfect archive, but without planning ahead, all we will have are the museums. And we are not doing the planning. The web, as a historic medium is far less than imperfect, it's temporary. Only present as long as someone keeps paying the bills. And there's no way to pay the bills far in advance, so the historic record has a literally no chance of surviving, given the current state of things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Village Voice offers a chance for us to learn how to do this right. So we can do it again, and again, until we've got a method that has a reasonable chance of working.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
