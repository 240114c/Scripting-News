			<description>Once a long time ago I wrote on this blog that we should have fewer humans, and the rage it provoked was awesome, and imho totally wrong. As we consume the life-sustaining ability of our planet, if we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2010/08/29/virgin.jpg&quot;&gt;fewer people&lt;/a&gt;, we'd consume it at a slower rate. I don't think there's any great reason to overpopulate the planet, esp when we're so resource-constrained. BTW, I'm a mystic, i.e. I believe in the mystery of it all. :-)</description>

			<description>I want to buy a cool exercise bike for home. I like the idea of taking virtual trips, and that there be inclines and declines. But I'm pretty sure I don't want to do cycling classes. Any recommendations?</description>

			<description>If you are pro-choice, as I am, focus your ire on people who vote for abortion restrictions. That's how we should divide ourselves. This isn't just a battle for women's rights, it's much broader than that. We need to unite, not divide. Keep that in mind when you post something clever that further divides us. You're doing someone else's work there, someone who is very much opposed to you and your values.</description>

			<title>Who's on the throne?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well here we go, the final episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones&quot;&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt;, and the big question, assuming there still is a throne, who's sitting on it at the end of tonight's episode? Whoever it is is in some sense the winner.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a wacky theory about it, I posted it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/949167355290670&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, might as well post it here too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What if...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The person who ends up on the throne is...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;None other than...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tyrion Lannister! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I assume there's going to be a showdown between Jon Snow and Daenerys. What if they kill each other? Or elope to a romantic hiding place?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Alterately, Arya kills Daenerys, and Jon Snow, who likes Tyrion (going back to season 1) returns to the north to be with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ghost&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tormund_Giantsbane&quot;&gt;red-haired friend&lt;/a&gt;. He could hook up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth&quot;&gt;Brienne&lt;/a&gt;, who is available now that Jaime is dead. There's your spinoff! He could pick up &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samwell_Tarly&quot;&gt;Samwell Tarly&lt;/a&gt; and family (son named Jon, btw) on his way north. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's crazy to think the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendry&quot;&gt;Baratheon bastard&lt;/a&gt; is going to be accepted on the throne. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Cersei was a Lannister. Tyrion is a Lannister. He's the next in line if you believe Cersei was a valid Queen. And why not. Everyone knows that Joffrey was a Lannister as was Tommen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Seems old Tyrion has the best claim to the throne. And he's not a murderer, he drinks wine and likes to fuck (or at least he used to). He's been pretty good to everyone, and Sansa loves him. He would be a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; king (you can almost hear him saying it). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think too many Kings Landing folk are going to be begging for a Targaryen to take the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if other people see this, but it seems reasonable to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tyrion for King! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/news/129&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; really resonated with me. So many good points. When a project catches on the work really changes. And the difference between this kind of creative work, and say writing music, is that software is used not just listened to. Another thing I've noticed is that people who come along and build off your open work expect you to step aside when they want to take over. This is a big disconnect, I create the software because I want to build on it, not to create a lifestyle for you, though I don't mind if you do that, that's why I made it open. But don't ever expect the originator of a project to step aside. That's a bug in your thinking. I've also noticed that the people who want to take over rarely have any original ideas other than they want to take over (and of course that's not original).</description>

			<description>The town of Woodstock, where I live, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/05/18/woodstocks-short-term-rental-regs-set-for-passage/&quot;&gt;working on a law&lt;/a&gt; to limit short-term vacation rentals. When I was shopping for a house here, I used the AirBnBs. But now that I own property here, I have conflicted views. I understand the reason they want the law is to have more housing available for full-time residents to rent.</description>

			<description>I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1129405186055782400&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; yesterday asking what people expect from the GoT finale, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/05/19.html&quot;&gt;tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; night. FWIW, I expect to be satisfied. They aren't going to pull any punches in the finale. They had something great last week, and they're going for the kill this week. I expect to be blown away.</description>

He's going to change the rules so the Mueller investigation is retroactively illegal. I bet they put some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-2016-campaign-spying-treason-warns-of-long-jail-sentences&quot;&gt;FBI people&lt;/a&gt; on trial. That'll completely put an end to investigations. In their calculations, people who work in government have to decide who they fear most, Trump or what comes after Trump.</description>

			<description>Suppose the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-fLC1dJi78&quot;&gt;worst person in the world&lt;/a&gt; has a great idea, but you aren't listening because you don't like this person. In normal times you would be the main loser. But if the idea could help us avert the climate or constitutional meltdowns, we all lose because of your pride. That's why I try to listen to smart people even if it hurts my ego.</description>

			<description>Resist efforts to divide us. When people say that a certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=old+white+men+abortion&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; of people, based on age, race or gender, is responsible for something bad, it probably isn't true.

			<title>Rating the integrity of guests</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had an idea watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/IjbqLTFP8Rs?t=44&quot;&gt;this clip&lt;/a&gt; from MSNBC, where a reporter does something unusual, he stops the person he's interviewing for BS, and then for not answering his question. This is so common in cable news, it's the #1 reason I switch channels.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the idea -- an organization, perhaps sponsored by Knight or Newmark, maintains a database of people who are interviewed on cable news. For each, the number of questions they were asked, the number of times they did and didn't answer the question. A simple way of measuring the integrity of the interviewee. And also the interviewer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You could publish an index for each of the shows. Do they tend to invite people on who actually answer questions? And then you could have an index for each network. They like horse race journalism. Turn it around, make the quality of their reporting a horse race. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twist: Penalize the show double if the person has been on before and evaded the questions both times. Fool me once, okay, ask to be fooled again, I'm a fool for listening to you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another index: Time spent talking vs how many ideas discussed. For a few people the ratio would be infinite, they just speak in a word salad, they say nothing. A great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Steele&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; is the former head of the RNC.  The best ratio, most substance to time talked would be interesting too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Goldberg&quot;&gt;Michelle Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the best. She ramps up quickly, says something interesting, doesn't repeat herself unless asked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>feedRead viewer app</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a specialized tool useful to a small number of people. I'm putting it here so I can easily find it by searching, when I need it in the future. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you may know I have a NPM package, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread&quot;&gt;davefeedread&lt;/a&gt;, that makes it easy to read most kinds of feeds in Node.js projects. I use it in my apps that read feeds, so when I fix a bug, I just have to add it in this one place and rebuild any app that uses it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedRead/blob/master/examples/webapp/feedreadviewer.js&quot;&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; it because I want people to use RSS. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I was debugging an app that generates RSS, and wanted to get a close look at what davefeedread was generating, and decided once and for all to put it in a web app, to make it easy to debug a feed. Should've done it long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example link:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedread.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;http://feedread.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It displays the structure that the davefeedread package returns for my feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danmactough&quot;&gt;Dan MacTough&lt;/a&gt; who wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedparser&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; package that this is built on.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;http://howardweaver.com/styled-12/index.html&quot;&gt;Howard Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, a long-time friend, journalist, asked &quot;What is an open identity server?&quot; I was able to answer the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1128674591201689602&quot;&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Briefly it's the part of Twitter that knows you're @howardweaver and I'm @davewiner. I need that in my software too. Rather than build my own, and make users establish a new &quot;identity&quot; for my apps, e.g. -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;,  I just use Twitter's.

			<description>One of my reasons for moving to the country was to have a real kitchen and to re-learn basic cooking. I used to love preparing meals. Last night I hit a milestone. A very simple dish, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/15/dinner.png&quot;&gt;broccoli, carrots&lt;/a&gt; -- cooked lightly, then lightly covered in olive oil, soy sauce and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha_sauce&quot;&gt;Sriracha&lt;/a&gt;, over rice. Just perfect. Previous iterations were basically edible. Working my way up to a full dinner for guests, maybe by Thanksgiving. But for now I'm happy to be eating well. Living in NYC made it too easy to order delicious food that was too greasy and too much and made me unhappy.</description>

			<description>I made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread&quot;&gt;davefeedread&lt;/a&gt; package a little more robust. Under some circumstances the lower-level feedparser package will return a length for an enclosure of &quot;None&quot;. This is not what my apps were expecting and as a result we missed a bunch of podcasts due to errors. Zero is much easier to handle, and there really is no correct value if the length is omitted, since it is required by RSS 2.0. But what can you do -- this is the real world, and it happens. Examples -- Radio Lab, Here's the Thing. I added a simple workaround. If the value is None, we set it to 0. Result: More podcasts to listen to. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I watched last night's Game of Thrones instead of Game 7 of the playoff series between Toronto and Philadelphia. No regrets, I had more invested in the GoT story than the story of either of the NBA teams, though I do have a thing for the Sixers and respect the hell out of the Raptors. When I came out from GoT the first thing I checked was the NBA schedule, and I could see that Toronto had won. But, like everyone else, I was struck to learn &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; they won. So many stories in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/13/waitingForTheResult.png&quot;&gt;fantastic photo&lt;/a&gt;, taken while the stars of the both teams wait to see if the at-the-buzzer &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kawhis-buzzer-beater-might-be-felt-around-the-league/&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; would go in. It would bounce four times before they knew the result. So much pent up energy in this, one of the greatest sports pictures of all time. Wonderful.</description>

She's in the other room lying down reading, something she did a lot, and for some reason I called her on the phone. We hadn't spoken in a long time. She said &quot;an angel is calling&quot; in a very sentimental way. She never said stuff like that. This morning I wonder maybe I was the one who died?

She said &quot;an angel is calling&quot; in a very sentimental way. She never said stuff like that. This morning I wonder maybe I was the one who died? Happy Mother's Day mom, where ever you are, or where ever I am. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sun, 12 May 2019 13:17:08 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/15/kristaps.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/05/12.html#a131708"/>

			<description>New feature in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=chat&quot;&gt;chat tab&lt;/a&gt;, permalinks. If you roll your mouse over &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/12/permalink.png&quot;&gt;the time&lt;/a&gt;, next to the author's name, you'll see it's a link. Click the link to get to a page with just that item on it. It's a permalink to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.scripting.com/story?day=2019/05/12/&amp;id=136&quot;&gt;story page&lt;/a&gt; for the item. That means you can point to a comment the same way you'd point to a blog post. It will continue to work even after there's a rollover of the chat stream (a fresh start that I'll do periodically). However story pages will not survive moderation, so this isn't a place to write a blog post. Respect the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;comment guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>My Facebook Manifesto</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're getting the downside of networking and not enough of the upside because progress is stalled due to Facebook's dominance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they had created a thriving ecosystem not underneath them but alongside them, no one would be talking about about breaking it up, it would already be in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everyone who's ever pursued a monopoly in tech should see (now) why it's a dead end. And people who in their hearts felt the web should stay open, you were right, it's the only sustainable option.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's easy and economical for Zuck to give up his monopoly and it doesn't require divestiture or breaking up. And it's necessary to get the web growing again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Key point: We have to have more than Zuck's mind working on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Doc Searls has an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/05/11/podcasting/&quot;&gt;interesting idea&lt;/a&gt;. Ask the big search engines to add another &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/11/searchCategories.png&quot;&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; to search -- Podcasts. That would help make clear that podcasts are a thing of the web.</description>

			<description>I haven't listened to a podcast in two weeks, not even the Daily podcast. I plan to come back. But right now I'm reading an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker&quot;&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; about Robert Moses and how power works. I had read it a long time ago, before I knew much about power myself. It's interesting in new ways at the other end of my life. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Mother's Day could benefit from being split in two, one holiday for people whose mothers are alive and one for those who aren't. For the latter, it would be a time of reflection and forgiveness. Holding on to the lessons and the love, and letting the other stuff go.</description>

			<description>In 1985, Apple did something bold and brave with the Mac, they included &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleTalk#AppleTalk&quot;&gt;networking&lt;/a&gt; with every Mac they made. This meant that if the APIs were easy for developers to adopt, to build on, the Mac would have gotten a huge wave of Mac-only networking software. There's no doubt that in my mind that the web would have booted up on the Mac, possibly years before it did on the NeXT platform. But the Apple networking APIs were impenetrable, so only a few developers, who probably secretly got help from Apple, or who were especially good at reverse-engineering APIs, managed to break through. Too bad, because when the web finally came along in the early 90s it didn't have a GUI, it wasn't WYSIWYG, and since this was the basis of Mac software, it's why Apple was slow to adapt to the web, even if their developers, now liberated from Apple's lock-in, rushed to adapt and led the early web. Apple definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing&quot;&gt;benefited&lt;/a&gt; from their decision to build-in networking, but they could have hosted the web, and we all would have gotten the benefit of the Mac user interface. The web would be very different, and imho much better. This should be a lesson for Facebook. If they bend down to be &lt;i&gt;part of the web&lt;/i&gt; instead of casting the web aside, long-term they'll own a huge share of the growth that comes from lots of independent developers working alongside them.</description>
