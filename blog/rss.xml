			<description>Every time you criticize a Democratic candidate, please add &quot;Whatever happens I'm voting for whoever isn't Trump. I hope you are too.&quot; This ought to be our mantra. Disagreement is great. Suicide is not permitted.</description>

			<description>Another problem in letting the silos usurp the name &quot;podcast&quot; is they will take it places that suit them, and when it's done, the term will mean &quot;failed get-rich-quick scheme.&quot;</description>

			<description>Once podcasting becomes a tech battleground, it will get to be like Disneyland or HBO. I like silos as much as anyone, I prefer Fresca to some unknown local brand of soda (are there any?) but what I love about podcasting is the mix of styles and ideas.</description>

He's basically found a new level in the game. He is very knowledgable of trivia, but also risks a lot. And that's why he wins.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/24/theHearingsAreWhatMatters.m4a&quot;&gt;17-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Impeachment is a TV show. Anyone who says they know what US politics will be like after the hearings is an idiot. They will transform the US.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Ervin&quot;&gt;Sam Ervin&lt;/a&gt; was probably the best character in Watergate. An avuncular country lawyer type, on the verge of senility, but incredibly eloquent all the same. He was one of the last Democrats from the Deep South to serve in the Senate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG6xMglSMdk&quot;&gt;Barbara Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, also on the Select committee was from Texas, and incredibly eloquent and held the attention of the camera.</description>

			<description>There's a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=chat&quot;&gt;Chat tab&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News. I've been planning to do this for some time, moving my basic &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/chat&quot;&gt;json.chat&lt;/a&gt; shell into a tab on Scripting News in place of Disqus, which has become an embarrassment. I still haven't figured out a bunch of stuff, like when rollover happens, causing the chat stream to reset. For now if you have a comment on something on Scripting News, post it there. But it must still follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Comment Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Keep it short, only add information to an existing post if it's asked for or you're pretty sure it would be welcome. No spam, and nothing that looks like spam, and of course nothing personal. I delete comments without explanation. I can block people here as with Disqus, so please respect the guidelines. ;-)</description>

			<description>People who think podcasts are not a product of the open web, ask yourself a simple question. Whose approval do you need to create a podcast? Today, no one. In the future, as silos take over, itâ€™ll only be for sanitized product. Void of inspiration. Safe.</description>

			<description>The next thing are the hearings to determine if the House impeaches. No one knows where we will be after the hearings and the people who say they know are wrong. Far from hurting the Dems chances in the 2020 election, the stuff coming out of the hearings will electrify the campaign. There will be all kinds of Republican unsavoryness on parade. A circular firing squad for the ages.</description>

Key point is that we can't just wish the problem away. We've been doing that for three years. Now resistance is more than symbolic. We've blown through every chance we've had to stop Trump. He will continue to ignore the Constitution. You want to live in that country? There only way to say no at this point is to impeach. This is a good timely podcast. Proud of how it came together.</description>

			<description>It's too hard to publish something to the open web. It has to be available as simple content. Not rendered inside a commercial template. Technically it's a very simple problem, actually. And the raw serving capability is dirt cheap. But it needs a corporate entity to run it.</description>

			<title>You should use Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I stopped on the street yesterday to talk with a couple of neighbors. The question of whether they should use Facebook came up. They read the NY Times and hear how bad FB is, they don't want to use it. They say the same phrases the NYT uses. Educated thoughtful people, want to do what's right, but they're getting their truth from a conflicted organization, imho. I thought about it, and here's a follow-up email I wrote.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nice to meet you X, and see you Y! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought some more about Facebook, of course it's a choice whether to use it or not, and they are the worst most greedy people in the world, they took from the web and refuse to give back, and there's very little nice I can say about the company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I think the news pubs are doing a disservice by trashing FB so thoroughly without offering an alternative that works the way it should. What they really want is the rest of us to be quiet and listen to them. That is not going to happen because what goes on on the net is too valuable and people won't give it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would love to see a world where we could use these great tools without giving up anything. We knew how to make that and it existed before FB, but they made it easier and figured out how to give it away free, and people didn't care to know about the cost...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- I've decided this isn't my battle. I'm going to get the benefit, and not worry about the cost. Nothing I can do about it anyway. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I should probably make this a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's time to impeach</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ignore the Constitution?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Those who say impeach is not the answer, what would Trump have to do in order to make impeach the right answer? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Well here's the thing, what makes you think he won't do much worse between now and inauguration day in 2021?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He wouldn't have any restraints between now and then.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And BTW, what restraints would there be on the next president? Maybe not such a buffoon as Trump. If we don't impeach and remove, we no longer have a Constitution that's enforced re the president. This guy has been ignoring it. We would all be ignoring it if he isn't impeached and removed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrupt attorney general&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The corrupt president now has a corrupt attorney general. That's something to factor into your thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One implication of this is that all the other DoJ cases that are open now, will soon be closed. It's within his power to close them. So if you're thinking about SDNY cases, forget it. They're not going to happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The only thing the people control now is the House. Are we going to let the Democrats make this a partisan thing? If you're an independent, now's the time to express that independence. You shouldn't care if a Democrat gets re-elected, if they're just as corrupt at the Repubs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump's corruption is a moving target. He's found new people who go along with his most wantonly destructive acts, so the future offenses will be worse than the ones we're reviewing now.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There comes a point when the sins of the president are so huge that Congress, no matter which party occupies it, has an obligation to start impeachment. Think about it this way. How would you feel if the Repubs held the House and refused to impeach, at this point.</description>

			<description>I think the House should decide whether to start impeachment hearings in a few weeks, after the Mueller report has been a bit more settled in. Unlike the gun debate, Dems wonâ€™t lose the power to act in a few weeks.</description>

			<description>The only question at the Austin conference wasn't really a question. In the back row a woman said I was talking about privilege when I was telling the story of the very earliest days of blogging. I said there were no barriers to entry. I guess she imagined the barriers were there, and I would have seen them and felt them if I weren't a privileged white male. She wasn't so nice about the way she said that, btw. And I didn't figure that out in the moment. The truth is, as I said, there were no barriers. So they couldn't have stopped anyone if they were another race or gender, they just weren't there. If a 40-something black woman from the east coast tried to start blogging, I think it would have worked, and instead of coming out of Silicon Valley, blogging might have come out of some other community, and have evolved in a different way. No matter what they would have had to know a little scripting, and be curious about how the protocols of the Internet worked. Maybe my privilege made it more likely I'd be interested. But I think it was more hereditary, and as I said at the conference, the impulse to blog was something I inherited from my mother, not a white man. Anyway, at first, I promise you, it was more a question of courage and imagination than any deep skills. That came later when we tried to create end-user software for blogging. For that you'd have to know a lot of programming techniques. I for one would have been anxious to work with whoever was the first blogger. &lt;i&gt;Working together&lt;/i&gt; is what I'm all about.</description>

			<description>After buying a house, moving, then going to a conference in Austin and getting a cold, I tried to have a productive programming day and got absolutely nowhere. That hasn't happened in a long time. Partially I think it's because I'm relaxed? Maybe I don't give as much of a shit? Or who knows. But it's a fact, I got nothing done today. I guess it happens. I'm going to spend the rest of the day doing the following: 1. Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt; season 1.  2. Catching up on the latest in The Mueller Report. 3. Watching a bit of NBA Playoff action. 4. Are the Mets playing?</description>

			<description>I always thought foot pedals would become a standard part of the UI. They haven't, but I think they would have if Apple had decided to try them out. When I write, my feet are doing nothing. However they are capable of driving a car, so why aren't we using them??</description>

			<title>Roku, the entertainment desktop</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been slowly rebuilding my home entertainment system, in a bootstrapping kind of way. My old system was built around a huge Denon receiver I bought in 2007, two Polk Audio towers (also 2007), and a 45 or 55 inch Sony Bravia screen bought in 2010 when I moved to NYC. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed in all those years, and I wanted to get caught up. First, I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798B2L5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;65-inch 4K TCL Roku&lt;/a&gt; screen and a cheap &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BJT931Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Onkyo receiver&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted immediately to get 2019-level equipment. Still using the Polk Audio towers. The picture quality was an amazing improvement over what I had before. Like many others, the picture was weird until I made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation&quot;&gt;motion smoothing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/402240/how-to-disable-motion-smoothing-on-a-roku-tv/&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got a cheap Polk audio &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KVQBA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;subwoofer&lt;/a&gt;. I never thought about how it would connect to the receiver. Then I assumed there would be speaker wire ports on both ends and I would hook it up as I did with the towers, using banana plugs. I was surprised to learn how subwoofers connect to receivers these days. Using some very legacy tech, totally non-digital -- simple old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D5H8IIU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;RCA plugs&lt;/a&gt;. I went on to Amazon hoping to find some, then I realized of course they would be easy to find. An entire new market has developed here. Super long mono RCA jacks, with gold plating. As someone who studies standards evolution in tech, this is both odd and gratifying. The old way just worked and no one screwed with it. Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also was pleased to learn about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#HDMI_Ethernet_and_Audio_Return_Channel&quot;&gt;ARC&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol that allows sound to flow back out over an HDMI wire. It means you only need one HDMI cable to hook up a receiver to a screen. It allows the receiver to play audio that's coming in through the TV. I was getting ready to set up an optical connection, as I did in the old setup. It's not needed any longer. I love factoring. Some good standards work. Met the customer need (I had actually thought of this while I was hooking up the TV and the receiver). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another great connection is now you can access the user interface of the receiver on the TV. It's weird to use their remote on a screen I usually use via the Roku remote, but it works. Onkyo's UI was understandable, but there are some very simple best practice type changes they should make. And it's hard to find out how to get the configuration screen back. I think part of the reason the sub-woofer doesn't work yet is that when I configured it initially, I told it I didn't have a sub-woofer. I think it was a mistake of them to ask, and a mistake of me to tell the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I'd like to be able to control the receiver through the Roku settings hierarchy. I imagine there either is a way for a receiver to do this, or they're working on it. It's too obvious a direction to head in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I assume Apple has tried to buy Roku. They have an incredibly valuable asset, the desktop of the digital entertainment world. It could be a franchise like Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm learning a lot about a tech in an area I have loved since I was a kid. Pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Sitting in the Austin airport early this morning hearing the names of Muslims on the PA system, such an ordinary thing in normal times, I wondered where we would be in a couple of years. Will those people still be fully righted Americans, or will the rule of law have completely collapsed. I wondered what must go through their minds. How conspicuous they might feel. And who would be next. When will we start putting Americans in concentration camps, and what comes after that. I couldn't convince myself that these were foolish thoughts.</description>

			<description>I just spent a few days in Austin at the ISOJ conference. I had a great time. Thanks to all the people who put on this complicated affair. I was interviewed yesterday morning by my longtime friend Rebecca MacKinnon, and co-conspiritor of original Berkman Thursday clan, and co-founder of Global Voices. Made a lot of new friends, and stayed true to my rather radical opinions about the course journalism should take into the future, and found to my surprise a lot of support among the assembled journalists and academics.</description>

			<description>I now find myself on a longish layover in Philadelphia, in Terminal F. Never been to this airport (no reason to, because my endpoint is usually JFK or EWR, but this time it's Albany). Looking forward to bingeing on the NBA playoffs which have so far been quite exciting. The Nets won and Orlando won, against teams that were thought to be superior. I doubt if I'll ever be a Nets fan, but they're the only quality act in NYC these days. And of course Game of Thrones and Killing Eve tonight. A great time to have a TV and a couch! :-)</description>

			<title>Instant tech bootcamps for journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This idea came up in Austin and was well-received. When journalism discovers a tech issue that appears to be a scandal, I proposed there should be a quickly convened flash conference, hosted by a university journalism department in conjunction with its computer science department. A two-evening bootcamp for journalists in New York, where the tech behind the scandal is examined dispassionately and objectively, by computer scientists who speak the language of journalism. A &quot;poets&quot; course. It is possible to understand the basics of an email server, for example, in a couple of hours, even if you only have a user's understanding of email technology. In the second evening, a smaller group convenes with journalists and techies, to write a concise backgrounder on the tech, and it is published, quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The organization that does this would be something like Politifact, but rather than fact-checking a story, it's providing the necessary background for all reporters working on a controversy, so the delay in getting seriously factual reports on the problem is minimized. It would also likely quickly evolve, and set a baseline for the kind of information every news org should publish along with a story about tech malfeasance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason this is needed is that our political system has (imho) overreacted to sensational stories, such as Hillary's emails, or misunderstood the extent of Facebook's API. And also completely missed looming crises, failing to catch them in time for them to be prevented. It seems journalism should aspire to do this as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I spent the whole day on airplanes flying from Albany to Chicago to Austin, and watched the whole first season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Foster_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Dr Foster&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix, and really enjoyed it.</description>

			<description>I'm going to Austin tomorrow, and thought I should have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/04/10/austinWeather.png&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=30.2676&amp;lon=-97.743#.XK4AQRNKiX0&quot;&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt;. The first words that emitted from my mouth were &lt;i&gt;Holy Shit.&lt;/i&gt; I'm not ready for a high of 91 (today) and only 81 on Thursday and Friday. In other news this will be my first flight from Albany via &lt;a href=&quot;https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=41.8843&amp;lon=-87.6324#.XK4ByBNKiX0&quot;&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, where there is a &quot;significant winter storm&quot; expected. I am totally not ready for this. What a crazy situation. I'm going through all this to talk for 45 minutes on Saturday? Probably a bunch of schmoozing too. I think I'm getting too old for this! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>An idea for banks as social/financial networks. I have a checking account at a major bank. I use it to pay bills. It's not a great user interface, and they don't keep my records indefinitely (I wonder why not) but it's way better than the old way of paying bills by hand with paper checks. Some companies have a special deal with the bank, so when I pay their bill, no paper check is written and mailed and they get their money much faster. An example is my credit card company. When I pay their bill, they get the money the next day. I just added another bill-to account for a business that has an account at the same bank. Why can't they optimize that so the money arrives in their account faster? In this case, they are actually mailing a check, which then has to be deposited &lt;i&gt;at the same bank.&lt;/i&gt; Ridiculous. It's 2019 not 1992. Optimize. And give more people an incentive to bank with you.</description>
