			<description>Too bad &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(actor)&quot;&gt;Brian Cox&lt;/a&gt; was born in Scotland, otherwise he'd make an excellent candidate to go up against Trump for the entertainment president.

The configuration of the kids is right too. Two good-for-nothing sons, and a gorgeous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/17/shiv.png&quot;&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; who seems she might have her head screwed on straight, but all along you know she's really her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/succession/283350/succession-season-2-the-pierce-deal-is-dead-but-shiv-still-looks-like-the-future&quot;&gt;father's daughter&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I was shocked that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/news/richard-m-stallman-resigns&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman resigned&lt;/a&gt; from the FSF. He is the founder. I'd like to see a clear accounting that explains how and why he was forced out, assuming that's what happened.</description>

			<description>A corollary of your never knowing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/philo_103409&quot;&gt;struggles&lt;/a&gt; of other people. As the people you think about grow older, the chance they're dealing with serious health issues approaches certainty. So if you make work for them that might be one reason they don't do it. This is one of the most offensive things about what &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is doing to the web. Make-work, security theater, whose main consequence won't be a more secure web, just a web with bigger holes in it.</description>

			<description>When I was a college student in New Orleans in the 1970s, I used to hang out at restaurants and bars on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Street_(New_Orleans)&quot;&gt;Oak St&lt;/a&gt; in Uptown. It's very close to the line separating the city and Jefferson Parish, and like most political lines in the area, it's marked by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee&quot;&gt;levee&lt;/a&gt;. If one side floods it doesn't necessarily mean that the other does. It was also very close to the Mississippi River, which of course also has a levee. In this case you walk up the levee, and the river comes to within a few feet of the top, way above the level of the city. If the levee were to break, a huge volume of river water would flood the city. I understood at an intellectual level how precarious this place was. But Oak St was an affluent street in a mostly affluent area. Living there you had the sense that it will always be this way. It seemed impervious to catastrophe. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html&quot;&gt;Thirty years later&lt;/a&gt;, after Katrina, I came back and Oak St was destroyed. A fire had raged through the area, unchallenged by fire fighters who were gone. The civilization that seemed so dependable had folded. The people had moved to other cities. New Orleans was almost empty. The point of the story is that climate change may seem theoretical because you live near an Oak St in whatever town you are in. But its stability, the foundation it's built on, is mostly in your imagination.</description>

			<source:outline text="When I was a college student in New Orleans in the 1970s, I used to hang out at restaurants and bars on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Street_(New_Orleans)&quot;&gt;Oak St&lt;/a&gt; in Uptown. It's very close to the line separating the city and Jefferson Parish, and like most political lines in the area, it's marked by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee&quot;&gt;levee&lt;/a&gt;. If one side floods it doesn't necessarily mean that the other does. It was also very close to the Mississippi River, which of course also has a levee. In this case you walk up the levee, and the river comes to within a few feet of the top, way above the level of the city. If the levee were to break, a huge volume of river water would flood the city. I understood at an intellectual level how precarious this place was. But Oak St was an affluent street in a mostly affluent area. Living there you had the sense that it will always be this way. It seemed impervious to catastrophe. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html&quot;&gt;Thirty years later&lt;/a&gt;, after Katrina, I came back and Oak St was destroyed. A fire had raged through the area, unchallenged by fire fighters who were gone. The civilization that seemed so dependable had folded. The people had moved to other cities. New Orleans was almost empty. The point of the story is that climate change may seem theoretical because you live near an Oak St in whatever town you are in. But its stability, the foundation it's built on, is mostly in your imagination." created="Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:32:06 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/10/04/goldenGirl.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/09/16.html#a153206"/>

When initializing a shared object, it ignored all non-scalar fields. I was using a daveutils routine copyScalars to do the copying. I wrote a new local routine that copies everything. I can't think of a reason it should only do scalars. It came up in an application I was writing. We're at that stage in this project where I try to use it as it was designed to be used and discover that the system guy (me) didn't correctly anticipate the needs of the app developer (also me).</description>

Suppose I request a link to a story, you include a code in the url, so when you get a hit you know it came thru me. At least deduct that page from my monthly quota. Or maybe a twofer.</description>

			<description>It took hours of digging through various bits of software to figure out that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nbariver&quot;&gt;nbariver&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account had been suspended because they thought it was sharing personal information inappropriately. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/twitterComplaint.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the report. Obviously we were not sharing personal information, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/tweetInQuestion.png&quot;&gt;relaying&lt;/a&gt; a news report from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/13/michael-porter-jr-adam-silver-cell-phone/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dp-sports-nuggets+%28Denver+Post%3A+Sports%3A+Nuggets%29&quot;&gt;Denver Post&lt;/a&gt; that some sharing had taken place. This is interesting because a human obviously would be able to tell the difference, and also it's exactly what we were discussing on Twitter over the last few days, how to automate these things. I did not delete the tweet, it was completely innocent.</description>

			<title>A definitive list of news feeds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted an item &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/14.html#a164047&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1172912815054737408&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; suggesting a collection of RSS feeds from news orgs managed by one or more universities. There were a few responses from people who believe they at least have a good start on this, so let me flesh out the idea a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Think of it as a process more than a product. A list frozen in time isn't very useful. We have lots of those. The idea here is that the list is maintained, it grows and shrinks as new feeds are created, new organizations get on board, and of course some fall off. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think the people should come from a university or a group of universities. It could be a student project. Lots of people flow through the project over time, and go out into the world and help build awareness of the project. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Having a list that no one knows about is pointless. There should be marketing activity for the project, a Twitter feed, Facebook group, what else? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All popular feed formats are supported. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Feeds should be added conservatively. The quality of the feeds is very important. The list should be culled of dupilicates, different URLs for the same resource. Don't worry about including two feeds that include similar stories (for example, there is a sports feed for the NYT and also a New York news feed, stories about the Knicks would appear in both, this is not a problem, ).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Use the standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;OPML subscription list&lt;/a&gt; format as documented. Add attributes to any item with the metadata you have for it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open source all the way. MIT License for any software, and Creative Commons for the list itself. Create a GItHub repository to store the list and any associated documentation. It can be distributed in other ways of course, via a website, an internet-accessible database.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please post &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/131&quot;&gt;your comments here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was asked in a recent interview to talk about the first software I remember seeing demoed. This was hard, because when I started programming, in the mid-70s , what we think of as software today, didn‚Äôt exist. In 1979 I got my eyes opened with a demo of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc&quot;&gt;VisiCalc&lt;/a&gt;. I had never ever conceived of something like that. I immediately decided to copy their user interface. Didn‚Äôt take more than a few seconds to grok it. That's elegance, a clear breakthrough.</description>

In 1979 I got my eyes opened with a demo of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc&quot;&gt;VisiCalc&lt;/a&gt;. I had never ever conceived of something like that. I immediately decided to copy their user interface. Didn‚Äôt take more than a few seconds to grok it. That's elegance, a clear breakthrough." created="Fri, 13 Sep 2019 21:45:48 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/09/13.html#a214548"/>

			<description>Chris Lydon &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/tech-master-disaster-part-one/&quot;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt; Evgeny Morozov. I tried listening, couldn't get very far into it. In the last 25 years a huge amount of new media has been created, I can't think of a single thing that was created at the Media Lab. Negroponte's column at the back of Wired wasn't a place to turn to for new ideas. Mostly it was self-promotion, as I recall. Demoware has always haunted tech. In my experience that's what the Media Lab pushes. Stuff the funding organizations go for. It seems in all the mess that came out of the Epstein affar at the Media Lab, someone at some point would have offered a defense of the form, &quot;But the Media Lab gave us X, Y and Z.&quot; But that never happened. I think in the early days, before the web, they did create some influential stuff, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/history.html&quot;&gt;Logo language&lt;/a&gt;. What's been uncovered in this scandal is how little is created with all the millions of dollars of funding, not just at the MIT Media Lab, but at all the media labs everywhere. Moral of the story, at least in this round of tech, money isn't what creates new media, individuals with a vision who persevere do.</description>

			<description>A minor league football coach could figure out how to beat Trump. It requires minor collaboration between the Democratic Party and the entertainment world. We need programming to go up against Trump. The programming has to be about Trump, because he's made himself the story. But it has to tell the story he doesn't want told, in as dramatic a fashion as he tells his story. It doesn't have to be good drama, it won't reach into your soul and make you cry, it doesn't need to because Trump can't do that. What it has to do is fill you with rage. Grab and hold your attention. But it must not be done by the Democratic candidate. The Republican team only has one play. It's a game where the quarterback runs. So you just fill the field with defensive backs. When Trump moves, destroy him. When he moves again, destroy him again. With what? Acting, childish pranks and low comedy.</description>

			<description>Back in the day they used to broadcast &lt;a href=&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera&quot;&gt;soap operas&lt;/a&gt; live. I assume they wrote the scripts the day before. So it would be interesting to use the same technique to dramatize the goings-on in the White House. Don't attempt to impersonate Trump and his staff, it's not funny or interesting -- maybe even given them different names to bring that home. Have them say and do the things the people in the White House are doing. Use your imagination. They can do things that haven't been reported on, or be dramatic flourishes.</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be great if all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/opinion/apple-keynote-2019.html&quot;&gt;reporters in tech&lt;/a&gt; got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/11/appleJoke.png&quot;&gt;together&lt;/a&gt; to see truly new stuff, without regard of which company it came from, or if it came from a company at all? The big message no one in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Establishment&quot;&gt;the establishment&lt;/a&gt; wants to hear (a term that's become precise these days) is that money does not yield progress. Jobs left a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA&quot;&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt; for you all as a clue. It's &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; that make the difference, not piles of money. That's the big reboot of news we're waiting for. For our news to stop worshipping money and get down to telling us what's new.</description>

			<description>I'm helping a publication do an oral history of podcasting. The writer is earnest, thoughtful, a good person. But... Would you read a history of cars written by someone who didn't know the basics of how cars work? It'll be a miracle if something coherent comes from this.</description>

			<title>On this day in 2001</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was up and blogging early &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/09/11.html&quot;&gt;on this day in 2001&lt;/a&gt;. If you visit the site you'll find that many of the links are broken, so you might want to try the archive.org &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070118082215/http://scripting.com/2001/09/11.html&quot;&gt;version&lt;/a&gt;. It's in reverse-chronologic order, so read from the bottom and scroll up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What the day was like for me. It started as a normal blogging and programming day. A link to an article on Wired. A plug for David Banks' book new book on Microsoft. And then the day started for real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At 6:15AM I got an email from Bill Seitz with a link to a webcam in the Empire State Building pointing south. The World Trade Center was in the middle of the picture, smoke was coming out of the side of one of the buildings. He said a plane had hit the building. I had no TV. Emails came from people in New York, some with pictures. People sent me links to stories via email (remember this was before RSS was supported by most news orgs). Digital cameras were just starting to catch on, readers in Brooklyn and in lower Manhattan, with clear views of the scene, sent pictures. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had no TV because I turned it off. I had become obsessed with cable news after the 2000 election. Didn't like it. I turned it back on later in 2001, when we started the war in Afghanistan.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;News orgs in New York had been knocked out, I was safe in California, but I grew up in New York, so I knew the geography. And later we'd learn that my father, a professor at Pace University hadn't been heard from. My mother, a school psychologist was on a rooftop in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That day my blog served the function that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1171807703372587008&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook play today. The biggest story in the world, before or since. Only as much as one person could absorb, only the questions that occurred to that person. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
