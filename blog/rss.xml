			<title>Notes on last night's debate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Watched the whole debate last night in despair, watching our last hopes evaporate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;These debates are crazy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They do nothing to help us find good leaders. Probably the opposite. People who think and listen before speaking are penalized. Yet this is what we need from a leader.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Has Bernie Sanders ever listened? To anyone? Ever?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Biden is even more pitiful. Please if someone loves him tell him to quit. He lost.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Amy doesnâ€™t know when to shut up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have no words for the disaster that is Warren.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I were on the debate stage last night, I would have done what Bloomberg did. All these people yelling about crazy nonsense, a lot of it at me, should I join in the yelling? Fuck no.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People say Bloomberg didn't respond to the accusations. I listened to what he said, this is what I heard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yes, I made a lot of money, and I'm giving it all away.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I made jokes about women and paid for my sins. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A communist can't win in America.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm a manager. I'm going to manage this. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm sorry for my fuckups. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What his critics really mean is that he declined to partake in the food fight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was shocked when I realized that lots of people were going to vote for Trump. But that's nothing compared to the gobsmacking realization that enough people want Sanders that he might actually be the nominee.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I guess the way to win people's hearts is to yell at them and over them, wave your hands in their face, and never listen to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sanders has a slogan for everything, except it's always the same slogan.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think Sanders would be great on Crossfire. As president. Oh god help us.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sanders is so awful he must be a Putin plant. When the oppo research comes out, obviously after he's nominated, I feel certain we're going to see pictures of hitm a dinner with Putin in Moscow with Jill Stein and Michael Flynn.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think everyone could stand to re-watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE&quot;&gt;Jon Stewart on Crossfire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Felt sad when I realized Buttigieg is by far the youngest person on the stage, but Sanders is getting the support from young people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobbierman/status/1230479993391796224&quot;&gt;Bob Bierman&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Man. Dems are going to have to do better than spend the evening taking easy razzle-dazzle shots at a billionaire who lacks theatricality and defensiveness but is giving all his money away to progressive causes. Where were the redirects to core issues?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bhgreeley/status/1230477872617476096&quot;&gt;Brendan Greeley&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Bloomberg is an organization where journalists fly business class. I want to say that didn't matter but I also don't want to lie to you people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Candidates are mirrors</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Honestly, either Klobuchar or Warren are more attractive than the others. I would definitely go with Klobuchar, still.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to say anything bad about the others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Choosing a candidate to me has nothing to do with judging the morals of the person. I have no insight into that. These &quot;people&quot; are images of people, not real.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You're selling a mirror to voters. It's imperfect. But when they look in the mirror do they like what it says about themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I liked looking into the Obama mirror. It says to me &quot;we've accomplished something in my lifetime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I looked at HRC, I saw some level of competence, but mostly &quot;NOT TRUMP.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why I like Klobuchar is what I see is &quot;This is America.&quot; A compromise with the other half of the country. I think enough of us can agree that this is America, for now, that we &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be able to restore the rule of law. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don't think most people get how deep in the hole we are now. We'd make a better decision if we were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I used this post to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mockcain/status/1230187515551920128&quot;&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; my outline-tweeting code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Andrew Shell did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/voicemailcast-20200218/&quot;&gt;voicemailcast&lt;/a&gt; about his work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewshell/rsscloud-server&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;, which plugs into RSS 2.0 feeds, and maintains backward compatibility with my implementation which I no longer maintain. He has to do really horrible things to run my software to be sure his stuff still works with it. His philosophy is mine. I really have very little influence on what other people do, sometimes they seem to not listen to prove they don't have to listen, and over time all our work gets erased. But Andrew definitely is a charter member of the soon-to-be-famous No Breakage Club.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/concord/issues/13&quot;&gt;Update on Concord work&lt;/a&gt;. I've been trying to fit a more powerful keystroke capturer under Concord's keyboard handling code, but I'm not ready to debug the resulting code, which would basically be turned inside-out. The problem is that none of the JavaScript key handlers (that I've found so far) will decode an existing event, they have to actually capture the event itself and call back to the app. Maybe there's an exception. If such a toolkit exists, that would make the systematization of Concord's keystroke handling simple enough to attempt. The goal is to have all combinations of option, shift, cmd (or cntrl) be handleable by the outliner.</description>

I still really dislike the concept of pairing RSS with that word. But this site gives me a chance to say concisely what RSS is. Things like RSS are useful forever. Live or die isn't even a question, it's a standard, an agreed-to way to make things that are compatible. It's gives users maximum power. It's kind of a miracle that it exists.

			<title>What is Scroll?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a test account for &lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.com/&quot;&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt; so I can figure out what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Scroll is interesting because it comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arctictony&quot;&gt;Tony Haile&lt;/a&gt;. He's a real product guy, having created Chartbeat. For the last few years, as I understand, he's been going to various future-of-news conferences. I met him at the Newsgeist show a couple of years ago. He's been talking about collaborating with news orgs on a new distribution system, and that's Scroll. There's a page for Scroll on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/scroll&quot;&gt;Crunchbase&lt;/a&gt; and they have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tryscroll&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; account. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once you're logged on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/17/scrollscreen.png&quot;&gt;you see&lt;/a&gt; a list of partners, and a section called reading activity. I wasn't paying attention the first few times I went there, but I assume they gave me a cookie, so that when I show up at their partner sites, it knows it's me, and they share the fact that I read that article with Scroll. I assume then that they give the publisher a micropayment from the monthly fee I pay them. The reading activity section shows me the partner stories I read. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I guess the theory goes like this. Paywalls are a pain in the butt. Users hate them. But you can go to these sites, without subscribing, without caring about the paywall. Read the story, and the fee is deducted from your Scroll balance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.com/sites&quot;&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; has a list of their partners, not sure if you can read this without paying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If every pub adopted it, I could cancel my subscriptions to the Washington Post, NY Times and The Athletic. And I would be able to read as many articles on currently paywalled sites like New York, New Yorker, The Atlantic and a few others that I usually run out of free reads on before the end of a month. I would no longer have to ration my clicks, and I would feel free to share links to all sites, as I did before there were paywalls. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So that's the trick. Tony has to get the paywalled sites that are in demand, the ones which people are on the edge of subscribing to but don't. He already has the sites without paywalls. But I don't see the ones I miss there. And until they are there, while I like Tony and expect great things from him, honestly, there's no reason for me to use Scroll.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I wasn't paying attention the first few times I went there, but I assume they gave me a cookie, so that when I show up at their partner sites, it knows it's me, and they share the fact that I read that article with Scroll. I assume then that they give the publisher a micropayment from the monthly fee I pay them. The reading activity section shows me the partner stories I read." created="Mon, 17 Feb 2020 15:03:44 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/17/150159.html?title=whatIsScroll#a150344"/>
				<source:outline text="I guess the theory goes like this. Paywalls are a pain in the butt. Users hate them. But you can go to these sites, without subscribing, without caring about the paywall. Read the story, and the fee is deducted from your Scroll balance." created="Mon, 17 Feb 2020 15:05:15 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/17/150159.html?title=whatIsScroll#a150515"/>

				<source:outline text="If every pub adopted it, I could cancel my subscriptions to the Washington Post, NY Times and The Athletic. And I would be able to read as many articles on currently paywalled sites like New York, New Yorker, The Atlantic and a few others that I usually run out of free reads on before the end of a month. I would no longer have to ration my clicks, and I would feel free to share links to all sites, as I did before there were paywalls." created="Mon, 17 Feb 2020 15:07:04 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/17/150159.html?title=whatIsScroll#a150704"/>
				<source:outline text="So that's the trick. Tony has to get the paywalled sites that are in demand, the ones which people are on the edge of subscribing to but don't. He already has the sites without paywalls. But I don't see the ones I miss there. And until they are there, while I like Tony and expect great things from him, honestly, there's no reason for me to use Scroll." created="Mon, 17 Feb 2020 15:09:21 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/17/150159.html?title=whatIsScroll#a150921"/>

			<title>Two debate questions for Democrats</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2020/2/7/21120657/democratic-debates-las-vegas-nevada-charleston&quot;&gt;Democratic debate&lt;/a&gt; this week. Expect the usual questions, Medicare for All, climate change, electability, etc. The candidates have well-rehearsed answers for these, including zingers and comebacks. But I keep thinking of questions I'd like to ask a would-be Democratic president, based on the world as it likely will be in 2021 when they take office. One where health care and climate change are not the biggest most immediate issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You've been elected president. It's Inauguration Day in 2021. The rule of law is broken. Congress is impotent. There are soldiers in the streets of DC. You're president now, and you can do anything you want. Your predecessor broke the Constitution, the Department of Justice runs a police state. We're in deep trouble. New wars, North Korea testing missiles over Japan. There's a rampant virus on the loose in world now, not just China, Trump supporters are threatening to revolt, there's talk of secession, not just in deep red states, but blue states too. So here's the question. Is your first priority to re-establish the rule of law or can that come later, after you put out all the big fires?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Again, you're the new president and a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; resigns, say RBG or Clarence Thomas. Suppose the Senate is still Republican, and McConnell is still the leader. First question: Who do you nominate? A liberal or a moderate? Does it depend on whose place they're taking? Second question: McConnell refuses to hold hearings, as he did with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland&quot;&gt;Merrick Garland&lt;/a&gt;. He's going to wait until a Republican is in the White House or there's a Democratic majority in the Senate. What do you do?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that these don't have to be debate questions, they could be part of a written test or a job interview. I don't need them to think on their feet. They can consult with advisors. I want to know what they will do, what kind of president they'll be. And if they don't have an answer, that'll be apparent too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been chatting about breakage with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davegandy?lang=en&quot;&gt;Dave Gandy&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/16/DaveGandyVoicemail.m4a&quot;&gt;15-minute voicemailcast&lt;/a&gt; to Dave, with a very small slice of my experience with breakage in tech. Dave is now a member of the No Breakage Club. Up until now I thought I was the only one. They learned the hard way by shipping a version of their product that basically broke everyone. It broke me. Squared the complexity of using FA, which ideally would require zero thought, it should &quot;just work&quot; as it did when I first adopted it in 2013. Now they're putting the pieces back together, and I'm guessing it will work. It doesn't always, sometimes you're stuck forever supporting both versions. At least if you care about your users. Not sure where this will go, but it's nice to have a friend on the frontier. In the cast I talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python#Compatibility&quot;&gt;Python's breakage&lt;/a&gt;, it came with v3.0.</description>

After a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150#issuecomment-586659712&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by Andy Sylvester, I quickly released v1.8.7, which works with the new Concord. The problem was that the name of the CSS file changed. The result is that the outlines &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/16/funkyScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; pretty horrible. To get the latest version reload the page.

			<title>Mobilize the electorate, with care</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's great that Bloomberg is spending huge money on good advertising that correctly positions the Dems vs Trump. But it's only half the job. The other half is organizing the electorate so we are always mobilized and ready for action&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My guess is they don't want to mobilize us because it isn't really about &quot;us&quot; -- it's about their power. An electorate that was organized could overthrow whoever it was that organized us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't blame them btw. I experienced this myself. In the early days of the net, I started an open mail list with my customers on it. So they could help each other, and ask questions of us. One of my competitors got the idea that they could join the list and market to our customers. Then they got the idea they could blow up the community by throwing huge flaming turds into the list. Since then I've struggled with how to create collaborative communities that don't have this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that Obama didn't keep the organization going after he got elected meant that the Repubs could stonewall him, and he had no effective way to appeal to the electorate to stand by him, even though a lot of us would have done so happily. His humiliation was ours.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/aFQFB5YpDZE&quot;&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt; went on CNN to plead that they give a shit. It's hard to watch because it was 2004, and it's gotten so much worse since then. Makes you realize that we wouldn't be in this mess if we had journalism instead of this garbage. Also fascinating that everyone thought he was joking, but everything he said was serious. The &quot;news&quot; was and is an emotional release.</description>

			<title>President Bloomberg, really a Democrat?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Since writing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/13/145424.html?title=bloombergIsMoreThanACandidateForPresident&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about Bloomberg's campaign I've done some more thinking and reading. The best piece I came across was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/why-democrats-should-not-nominate-bloomberg-sexual-harassment-plutocracy.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; in New York by Eric Levitz. It's a long piece, totally worth reading all the way through, but this was the paragraph that made me stop and think.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The same personal fortune that would free the Democratic Party from cash constraints this fall would also liberate a President Bloomberg from partisan constraints once in office. If the plutocratic president decides to find common ground with a Republican Senate on Social Security cuts, what leverage will the Democratic Party have over 'their' White House?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's a really good question. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I came up with a couple of solutions and a couple of conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Insist that Bloomberg burn his bridges with the Republican Party. Go to Kentucky and campaign against Mitch McConnell, who is up for re-election this year. Campaign with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_McGrath&quot;&gt;Amy McGrath&lt;/a&gt;, his Democratic opponent. Help her with advertising and donate to her campaign. Do the same for all congressional Republicans, with an emphasis on the ones with the most tenure and visibility. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even better, Bloomberg steps back in favor of one of the current Democratic candidates. In other words fulfill the promise he made about funding the Democratic campaign against Trump even if he's not the nominee -- now. Take Bloomberg out of it. I think Klobuchar would be the best choice (more on that later). Now we can be sure the president will be a pure Democrat. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The first conclusion -- who cares. The choice in 2020 is about the end of American rule of law. Who knows what the implications are of that. We've never had a lunatic autocrat or monarch with the economic and military power of the United States. In that context, who cares if it's the end of anything as long as we can vote him out of office in four years. (Also since he contributed to Democrats, he's going to have to work with a Democratic Congress, which as we know can be a good check on a legal presidency.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another conclusion -- imagine a happy ending, and write the history of it, from 20-30 years out. Here's what I would write. 2020 was a pivotal election. The Democratic Party and the remnants of the Republican Party that still believed in the Constitution formed a bond, and elected a transitional president, Michael Bloomberg, a former Republican, technocrat, oligarch. This marginalized the extreme part of the Republican Party that was loyal to Trump. The Democrats won the presidency and Congress with huge margins, enough to codify the norms that Trump violated. After the election, the two groups went their own ways, forming two new parties, one liberal and one conservative, and the country evolved out of the insane partisanship of the 90s, 00s and 10s. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Bloomberg is more than a candidate for president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/michael-bloomberg-democratic-primary/&quot;&gt;Joan Walsh&lt;/a&gt; who I admire for being a listener, a rare thing among pundits, wants Bloomberg on the debate stage. She imagines that his opponents would tear him apart over things he said about racial profiling and red zoning in past decades. So many things to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I heard former Philadelphia mayor &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyy.org/episodes/nutter-stands-by-bloomberg-on-stop-and-frisk-and-the-campaign-trail/&quot;&gt;Michael Nutter&lt;/a&gt;, a contemporary of Bloomberg's as mayor of NYC, on NPR yesterday. He's black. They were trying to get him to say Bloomberg was wrong and bad or whatever, but he wouldn't. He said plainly that the violence problem in his city was with black and Hispanic young men, and it was probably the same in NYC. They were the ones walking around with guns. The cities were desperate to get those guns out of their hands. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Joy Reid, on MSNBC on Tuesday night, who is also black, said that blacks have only ever felt passionately about one candidate, Obama. Otherwise they make pragmatic choices. They want to get rid of Trump. They'll choose Bloomberg if they think he's the best way to do that. That's how I vote too, I try to do it always, pick the candidates who would best do what should or must be done. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;OK so Bloomberg is on the debate stage. Each candidate, except perhaps Sanders, is thinking, if I'm the nominee, I'm going to need his support. They aren't likely to go for the jugular. Think of Bloomberg not just as a candidate, but also as a Democratic Koch or Adelson. If he isn't the nominee the Bloomberg PAC is going to play a big role in Democratic politics. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If Bloomberg were just throwing money at this it wouldn't work. But it is working. He thinks creatively, is willing to risk not just his money but his reputation and legacy. &lt;i&gt;He's doing the marketing that the Democrats have failed to do for generations.&lt;/i&gt; He is so smart, most billionaires want to hold on to their money, which is ridiculous, given how short life is and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marknyt/status/1228019691886608384&quot;&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; they are. He's using his money for good, now -- and that imho overshadows every past sin he has been accused of and is likely to be accused of. It doesn't eliminate them, but they have to be considered against the good he is doing, which imho is enormous. He's a gift horse and go ahead and look if you must, but he should keep going in the meantime. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A creative idea. Bloomberg could offer say $50 million to any still-running candidate, to be used for advertising to position against Trump, now, no strings attached. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg is not just a candidate. He's doing the marketing, actually just starting to, that the Democrats have failed to do, ever. All the while the Republicans have mastered it. The Democrats are so unaware of this, they don't even see it. So when they look at Bloomberg they only see what they know to look for. A horse in a race. But he's a developer, working on defining media and politics for the world of 2020. He's going to test every assumption we have about how campaigns work, and that itself will be incredibly valuable. Let's pay close attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's also working in advance of Trump, who hasn't yet managed to shut off political advertising of his opponents. This door should be shoved wide open in the most captivating way possible so when and if he shuts it down, people will miss it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Steve Jobs came along he looked at computers differently from the way IBM did. He looked for assumptions that could be broken and the result was the Apple II. When we got blogging and podcasting going, again we looked for assumptions of print journalism and radio that could be broken and it worked. We haven't yet done that for politics. Not just money-raising, that was solved in 2004 by Howard Dean and Joe Trippi. Actually doing politics effectively without being controlled by trolls using the networking technology of today. Bloomberg, a master of tech and media, is probably the best person in the world to try to do this right now. That's what journalism is, predictably, missing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was Bartlet for America, which begat Dean for America, now we need to be more specific -- politics for the rest of us. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/14/141155.html?title=presidentBloombergReallyADemocrat&quot;&gt;President Bloomberg, really a Democrat?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A horse in a race. But he's a developer, working on defining media and politics for the world of 2020.

Not just money-raising, that was solved in 2004 by Howard Dean and Joe Trippi. Actually doing politics effectively without being controlled by trolls using the networking technology of today.

As a son of New York, born and raised there, and who recently spent nine years living there, this is a perennial story, told many times every generation, and so far, it has never been true. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They said it when my family came to the city in the 1940s. Refugees from Europe will destroy the soul of the city. I don't think so. We were just added to the melting pot. Before that it was the Irish, Italians, African Americans, Hispanics, every race, religion, you name it, they've all been accused of destroying the city.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now they're replacing the great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poetspath.com/napalm/_special_edition_nhs_2013/Newman1.htm&quot;&gt;delis&lt;/a&gt;, diners and bodegas with &lt;a href=&quot;https://locator.chase.com/&quot;&gt;ATM farms&lt;/a&gt;, the soul of the city is being destroyed they say, I agree, but read on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I assume that Bloomberg did incentivize the obscene construction of residential skyscrapers in Manhattan, esp on the southern edge of Central Park, blocking out sunlight, to provide excellent views to Russian oligarchs and Saudi oil princes who are never there. But at the same time, Queens, the borough that raised me, that was a sleepy boring white bread place when I was growing up, has become the melting pot Manhattan used to be. People actually go to Flushing to eat the best Asian food in the city. If you had told me that when I was growing up there, I would have said it'll never happen. Flushing is an embarassment. It has a creek that smells like a sewer. And for crying out loud it's named Flushing. Geez. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The city is complex, huge, impossible to control. It's possible that some things Bloomberg did to the city may have lasting negative consequences, but he also made some things better. My favorite Bloomberg accomplishment were the bike lanes. I must have ridden five thousand miles in the city in the last decade. It's an excellent city for biking, but who would have thought that? Not me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Our Banana Republic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What's going on with the DoJ is serious, the news has captured that, but the reporting misses a few important things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why we don't want justice to be partisan. The reports assume people understand, but I think a lot of people may not put two and two together. If justice is applied not based on evidence but on whether you're in favor with the president, the inverse will happen too, people are prosecuted because they're enemies of the president. Expect Comey to be arrested soon, and perhaps Schiff, Pelosi, Romney and others who have crossed Trump in more powerful ways that poor Colonel Vindman. You may say, oh well, the president is just one person, how much damage can he do, but he is the top person, and people below will look for signals and will inevitably try please him. You end up with justice being bought and paid for in favors to the top guy and his capos. A government not of laws, but of organized crime. However cynical you may be about justice in the US, the system we've lived with has rules that limit abuse, but those rules appear to be slipping away now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This isn't the first time &quot;crony justice&quot; has happened in the last few months, or even the biggest travesty. Recall that the DoJ refused to investigate the accusations of the Ukraine whistleblower that led to Trump's impeachment. So the House had to do its own investigating. The congressional Republicans made an issue of how the Democrats did the investigating, but the press for the most part overlooked that they shouldn't have had to do the investigating in the first place. That's why we have a DoJ. When the government is properly functioning it would have been routine, but Barr is acting as the president's attorney, not the US's attorney, therefore of course he didn't investigate.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The various departments may report to the president but they work for Congress as much as they do the president. No longer true. That's why the second article of impeachment, the one Romney didn't vote for, was so important. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also while it's honorable for a DoJ lawyer to resign a case, or resign from the department, and something we should applaud (as opposed to standing by and accepting the malpractice), also note that it serves Barr's purposes to get rid of the ethical people who remain, and once gone they can no longer sound the alarm. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

You end up with justice being bought and paid for in favors to the top guy and his capos. A government not of laws, but of organized crime. However cynical you may be about justice in the US, the system we've lived with has rules that limit abuse, but those rules appear to be slipping away now." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:33:10 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/12/143230.html?title=ourBananaRepublic#a143310"/>
					<source:outline text="This isn't the first time &quot;crony justice&quot; has happened in the last few months, or even the biggest travesty. Recall that the DoJ refused to investigate the accusations of the Ukraine whistleblower that led to Trump's impeachment. So the House had to do its own investigating. The congressional Republicans made an issue of how the Democrats did the investigating, but the press for the most part overlooked that they shouldn't have had to do the investigating in the first place. That's why we have a DoJ. When the government is properly functioning it would have been routine, but Barr is acting as the president's attorney, not the US's attorney, therefore of course he didn't investigate." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:33:24 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/12/143230.html?title=ourBananaRepublic#a143324"/>
					<source:outline text="The various departments may report to the president but they work for Congress as much as they do the president. No longer true. That's why the second article of impeachment, the one Romney didn't vote for, was so important." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:35:46 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/12/143230.html?title=ourBananaRepublic#a143546"/>
					<source:outline text="Also while it's honorable for a DoJ lawyer to resign a case, or resign from the department, and something we should applaud (as opposed to standing by and accepting the malpractice), also note that it serves Barr's purposes to get rid of the ethical people who remain, and once gone they can no longer sound the alarm." created="Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:36:26 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/02/12/143230.html?title=ourBananaRepublic#a143626"/>
