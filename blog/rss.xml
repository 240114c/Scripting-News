			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/podcasts/the-daily/harvey-weinstein-lisa-bloom.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about Harvey Weinstein. The reporters covering him for the NYT got access to the notes, letters and emails of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Bloom&quot;&gt;Lisa Bloom&lt;/a&gt;, one of Weinstein's &lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/weinstein-may-be-monster-lawyers-who-enabled-him-are-real-villans-81086&quot;&gt;attorneys&lt;/a&gt;, detailing the PR and legal campaign to get the story killed. Presumably these techniques worked in the past, but this time the story came out.</description>

			<description>I didn't have to read this &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/is-elizabeth-warren-electable.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about whether or not Elizabeth Warren is electable vs Trump. Of course she is. She's just beginning to hit her stride. Let's push her to the top. It's up to us to decide if she's electable.</description>

			<description>One thing I would insist on from Warren -- if she wins -- is that she keep the people organized. The campaign does not stop if she's elected, actually that's when it kicks into super high gear. That was the mistake Obama made. We had a chance to install democracy everywhere.</description>

			<description>History will not be kind to Obama re Trump and Putin. He vastly underestimated both. And showed it, in both cases, publicly. Presidents can't do that.</description>

			<description>Dave Carlick, marketer, a friend for decades. He did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot; cogitank+ergo+sum&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cogitank Ergo Sum&lt;/a&gt; campaign for us, among others. He also pioneered what he called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=carlick+&quot; database+marketing&quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;Database Marketing&lt;/a&gt;. It's what the whole tech industry is based on now. He went on to do Netscape's first website, then became a VC, and a board member lots of places, but we still hang out like we did in the early 80s. Anyway, Dave was one of the first to subscribe to my blog via &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;, and the other day he told me an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/15.html#a192924&quot;&gt;idea I posted&lt;/a&gt; was good. That meant the world to me. For years there has been almost zero feedback to this blog from real-world friends.</description>

			<description>Idea for a product. Customizable search engine with prefs. I'd like to have Wikipedia page come first in all searches for which there is a Wikipedia page. I think of Google and Wikipedia as if they were two branches of government. I use them to check up on the other. That's really how search has evolved for me in 2019.</description>

			<description>I just bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-5/&quot;&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;. I wear mine all the time. The reason I got the upgrade? Always-on screen. It's a pain when riding my bike and I want to see what's on the watch, I have to take both hands off the handlebars to get the watch to show me. So I don't do it. I'm getting $100 back for my previous Apple Watch, still in perfect shape.</description>

			<description>I used my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/apple-card/&quot;&gt;Apple credit card&lt;/a&gt; to buy the watch. Surprised they didn't streamline that, it shouldn't have required me to enter a number. They know who I am, my identity connects the store and the card. They didn't even acknowledge that I used their card. Apple, who has often set the bar really high for marketing awareness, missed an opportunity for an obvious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzQaEtMwBw8&quot;&gt;high five&lt;/a&gt;. They should also btw give you a discount for using their card, esp in early days.</description>

			<description>Too bad &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(actor)&quot;&gt;Brian Cox&lt;/a&gt; was born in Scotland, otherwise he'd make an excellent candidate to go up against Trump for the entertainment president.

Two good-for-nothing sons, and a gorgeous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/17/shiv.png&quot;&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; who seems she might have her head screwed on straight, but all along you know she's really her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/succession/283350/succession-season-2-the-pierce-deal-is-dead-but-shiv-still-looks-like-the-future&quot;&gt;father's daughter&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>This is hell</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/17/politics/andrew-yang-shane-gillis-fired-from-snl-response/index.html&quot;&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/a&gt;. We’re destroying people’s lives. You feel powerful, then you move on. The people whose lives you destroyed are still destroyed. Sometimes the punishment fits the crime, but (key point) this is not how our system works, for good reason. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have laws and courts and juries and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the “crimes” are getting increasingly meta.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there’s no provision for rehab.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or wrong verdicts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is hell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: So you know -- I know how it feels to seek revenge on people whose ideas are abhorrent. I was a fan of Mel Gibson's movies until it came out that he was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;biw=1202&amp;bih=832&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNSfz5swsfSSlRJVt61nbAqIMf28sA%3A1568728429417&amp;ei=beWAXZ7sGIyb_Qbj55rwCw&amp;q=mel+gibson+anti-semitism&amp;oq=mel+gibson+anti-semitism&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...4915.5204..5804...0.0..0.119.224.0j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......35i39.48OFMy0QQ1g&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje1qLmgNjkAhWMTd8KHeOzBr4Q4dUDCAs&amp;uact=5&quot;&gt;anti-semite&lt;/a&gt;. Now I'm appalled that he's working in Hollywood again, they've decided to accept him back. I don't like it, but abhorrent ideas are not a crime in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A corollary of your never knowing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/philo_103409&quot;&gt;struggles&lt;/a&gt; of other people. As the people you think about grow older, the chance they're dealing with serious health issues approaches certainty. So if you make work for them that might be one reason they don't do it.

			<description>When I was a college student in New Orleans in the 1970s, I used to hang out at restaurants and bars on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Street_(New_Orleans)&quot;&gt;Oak St&lt;/a&gt; in Uptown. It's very close to the line separating the city and Jefferson Parish, and like most political lines in the area, it's marked by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee&quot;&gt;levee&lt;/a&gt;. If one side floods it doesn't necessarily mean that the other does. It was also very close to the Mississippi River, which of course also has a levee. In this case you walk up the levee, and the river comes to within a few feet of the top, way above the level of the city. If the levee were to break, a huge volume of river water would flood the city. I understood at an intellectual level how precarious this place was. But Oak St was an affluent street in a mostly affluent area. Living there you had the sense that it will always be this way. It seemed impervious to catastrophe. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html&quot;&gt;Thirty years later&lt;/a&gt;, after Katrina, I came back and Oak St was destroyed. A fire had raged through the area, unchallenged by fire fighters who were gone. The civilization that seemed so dependable had folded. The people had moved to other cities. New Orleans was almost empty. The point of the story is that climate change may seem theoretical because you live near an Oak St in whatever town you are in. But its stability, the foundation it's built on, is mostly in your imagination.</description>

When initializing a shared object, it ignored all non-scalar fields. I was using a daveutils routine copyScalars to do the copying. I wrote a new local routine that copies everything. I can't think of a reason it should only do scalars. It came up in an application I was writing. We're at that stage in this project where I try to use it as it was designed to be used and discover that the system guy (me) didn't correctly anticipate the needs of the app developer (also me).</description>

			<description>It took hours of digging through various bits of software to figure out that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nbariver&quot;&gt;nbariver&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account had been suspended because they thought it was sharing personal information inappropriately. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/twitterComplaint.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the report. Obviously we were not sharing personal information, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/15/tweetInQuestion.png&quot;&gt;relaying&lt;/a&gt; a news report from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/13/michael-porter-jr-adam-silver-cell-phone/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+dp-sports-nuggets+%28Denver+Post%3A+Sports%3A+Nuggets%29&quot;&gt;Denver Post&lt;/a&gt; that some sharing had taken place. This is interesting because a human obviously would be able to tell the difference, and also it's exactly what we were discussing on Twitter over the last few days, how to automate these things. I did not delete the tweet, it was completely innocent.</description>

			<title>A definitive list of news feeds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted an item &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/14.html#a164047&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1172912815054737408&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; suggesting a collection of RSS feeds from news orgs managed by one or more universities. There were a few responses from people who believe they at least have a good start on this, so let me flesh out the idea a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Think of it as a process more than a product. A list frozen in time isn't very useful. We have lots of those. The idea here is that the list is maintained, it grows and shrinks as new feeds are created, new organizations get on board, and of course some fall off. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think the people should come from a university or a group of universities. It could be a student project. Lots of people flow through the project over time, and go out into the world and help build awareness of the project. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Having a list that no one knows about is pointless. There should be marketing activity for the project, a Twitter feed, Facebook group, what else? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All popular feed formats are supported. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Feeds should be added conservatively. The quality of the feeds is very important. The list should be culled of dupilicates, different URLs for the same resource. Don't worry about including two feeds that include similar stories (for example, there is a sports feed for the NYT and also a New York news feed, stories about the Knicks would appear in both, this is not a problem, ).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Use the standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;OPML subscription list&lt;/a&gt; format as documented. Add attributes to any item with the metadata you have for it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open source all the way. MIT License for any software, and Creative Commons for the list itself. Create a GItHub repository to store the list and any associated documentation. It can be distributed in other ways of course, via a website, an internet-accessible database.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please post &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/131&quot;&gt;your comments here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It went off in a lot of directions, I brought it back to what I think is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1172912815054737408&quot;&gt;constructive first step&lt;/a&gt;. A collection of RSS feeds from news orgs, maintained, with metadata. Something a group of j-school students, maybe even from different unis, could do. Lots of room for growth here.  ;-)</description>

			<description>My neck is out, the way my back used to go out. Very stiff and painful. I think the cause is bad shoes and too much walking. Taking it relatively easy for a few days.</description>

			<description>I was asked in a recent interview to talk about the first software I remember seeing demoed. This was hard, because when I started programming, in the mid-70s , what we think of as software today, didn’t exist. In 1979 I got my eyes opened with a demo of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc&quot;&gt;VisiCalc&lt;/a&gt;. I had never ever conceived of something like that. I immediately decided to copy their user interface. Didn’t take more than a few seconds to grok it. That's elegance, a clear breakthrough.</description>

			<description>Chris Lydon &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/tech-master-disaster-part-one/&quot;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt; Evgeny Morozov. I tried listening, couldn't get very far into it. In the last 25 years a huge amount of new media has been created, I can't think of a single thing that was created at the Media Lab. Negroponte's column at the back of Wired wasn't a place to turn to for new ideas. Mostly it was self-promotion, as I recall. Demoware has always haunted tech. In my experience that's what the Media Lab pushes. Stuff the funding organizations go for. It seems in all the mess that came out of the Epstein affar at the Media Lab, someone at some point would have offered a defense of the form, &quot;But the Media Lab gave us X, Y and Z.&quot; But that never happened. I think in the early days, before the web, they did create some influential stuff, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/history.html&quot;&gt;Logo language&lt;/a&gt;. What's been uncovered in this scandal is how little is created with all the millions of dollars of funding, not just at the MIT Media Lab, but at all the media labs everywhere. Moral of the story, at least in this round of tech, money isn't what creates new media, individuals with a vision who persevere do.</description>

			<description>A minor league football coach could figure out how to beat Trump. It requires minor collaboration between the Democratic Party and the entertainment world. We need programming to go up against Trump. The programming has to be about Trump, because he's made himself the story. But it has to tell the story he doesn't want told, in as dramatic a fashion as he tells his story. It doesn't have to be good drama, it won't reach into your soul and make you cry, it doesn't need to because Trump can't do that. What it has to do is fill you with rage. Grab and hold your attention. But it must not be done by the Democratic candidate. The Republican team only has one play. It's a game where the quarterback runs. So you just fill the field with defensive backs. When Trump moves, destroy him. When he moves again, destroy him again. With what? Acting, childish pranks and low comedy.</description>

			<description>If someone says something to you that hurts, and on reflection you're sure it was &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; it hurts, then turn around, walk out, and never look back.</description>
