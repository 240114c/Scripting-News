			<description>Maybe the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66CP-pq7Cx0&quot;&gt;best end&lt;/a&gt; of any &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_%26_Louise&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; ever. It's now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/18/thelmaLouiseEnd.png&quot;&gt;header&lt;/a&gt; image &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/18.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't like the picture that was there &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/26/lake.png&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, but spring hasn't happened here yet, and until then I have nothing to replace it with. Thelma and Louise should be the default header here, as it is the permanent one on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;. BTW, I've been meaning to say this, if you want to get the most out of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; you should have an account on Twitter so you can, for example, go there and vote in the polls. Twitter has a useful set of functionality, and they let me use their API and identity system for $0. Pretty good deal. You don't have to do it of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üöÄ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Look at the units on the Y axis of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/18/graph.png&quot;&gt;typical graph&lt;/a&gt; of the rate of deaths in various countries. If it were drawn to scale, you'd barely be able to see the ones near the bottom. I don't think most people notice this and are misled.</description>

			<description>I understand we're at risk of losing journalism. I propose something grand, like what we're doing with the economy. Merge all the different news orgs in America, like the states are linking up at governor level, and then put your heads together and stop doing stuff that makes the problems worse, and get busy with the new reality. Stop duplicating efforts, chasing gotchas, going through the loops with Trump, and making users give each of you their information just to give you money. Reduce friction, build a new journalism we can all be proud of.</description>

			<title>I wish the Democrats would use the fucking tools</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A service the Democrats should run, now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A daily advisory saying which government edicts you should not obey to protect your life and other's lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, there must be Democrats in Jacksonville who do not know going to the beach is not safe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tell them. Save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each time I think the Dems are establishing a persistent online channel via social media, e.g. Howard Dean in 2004, Obama in 2008 and 2012, the Clinton campaign in 2016, Bloomberg this year, even Warren, as soon as the campaign is over the freaking channel closes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is as stupid as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That channel should NEVER close. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not only is it bad marketing, it's also dangerous policy. Remember Dems you're running for a reason -- to govern. To be good at it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well even if you aren't president, we still need leadership, esp in times of a void in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Glitch, day 4</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay so I decided what my next step would be in my exploration of Glitch, get &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; running there. And I did, and it took about five minutes. I keep trying to get Glitch to put up some resistance, but it doesn't. It really does run Node code, unmodified. When I get it working so quickly I'm dazed and need to retreat a bit and think some more as if I had hit obstacle after obstacle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the server: &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;pagepark.glitch.me&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just put a random OPML file there, and it just worked, as it should.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I lied. I did have to make a small mod. After reading the config.json file, I had to add a check to see if process.env.PORT was defined, and if so use that port, instead of the default port. That's how Glitch tells you what port to run on, same way Heroku does. I will add that to the PagePark distribution so it'll run without mods.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so now I know what I want to do next. Find out if they have an API so I can use my own editor to write for this site. And all of a sudden I will have something useful that is shareable. Not bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So do they have an API? That's the next thing to look into.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I wonder if there's a way to have it load from the GitHub repo automatically?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168#issuecomment-615894200&quot;&gt;thread on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with this new info. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If they were going to choose a special Time person of the year, I'd nominate The Governor. We're depending on them, given who the president is, and they appear to be coming through, setting an incredible example by working together against the odds and against the norms of the last 30 years.</description>

			<description>I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1251089277620019200&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; early this morning asking people to pick one of four women as Biden's running mate. They were Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitmer, Elizabeth Warren and Stacey Abrams, in that order. Not surprisingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer&quot;&gt;Whitmer&lt;/a&gt; is getting the fewest votes, but I think she's the best choice. Midwestern governor. Very composed, take-charge person, but also compassionate. Young but not too young. She's under incredible pressure, and apparently doing well. Maybe I like her so much because I don't know much about her. It's possible. But it's her moment now, and there's something to be said for pulling the in-the-moment energy into the campaign. He can't choose &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; because of his pledge, but Whitmer might be even better. Now could she campaign and deal with the problems of Michigan, which are substantial. That might be a very good way to campaign, actually. And she seems to pass the most important test -- she would be a good chief executive for the country if she is needed for that.</description>

			<title>Glitch, day 3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay it took a lot of hacking, discomfort, trial and error and confusion, because the Glitch model is so different from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; I'm used to, but I did finally get a simple editor app running on a Glitch server. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://macwrite.org/glitch/&quot;&gt;variant&lt;/a&gt; of MacWrite. Hooks up to an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodeStorage&lt;/a&gt; running on the Glitch server, which in turn connects to Twitter for identity, and it stores the files in the folder Glitch gives me. This is not meant to be something useful, just a testbed to learn with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shot: Simple text editor running on Glitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've had trouble with is knowing when it's running what version of my app because they appear to relaunch it on every editing change. I understand they do this for newbie programmers, so it's something they don't have to learn to get to Hello World. I might do it that way. But as a programmer for many years, I would like to control that. Ideally from the terminal. Run the app the way I do on my Linux server. &lt;code&gt;node appname.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A little prior art, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal&quot;&gt;Turbo Pascal&lt;/a&gt; was very explicit in when you ran what version of the app. You had to stop the app manually, and then restart it after a change. I was already a professional programmer at the time, so I can't vouch for how that worked for newbies, but a lot of people learned to program in TP, so it worked for some of them. In other words, not sure the way Glitch does it is even the right way to go for beginners. You want there to be as little magic as possible, imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure what my next experiment will be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thread on GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168&quot;&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I went grocery shopping today. Took a couple of hours all-told. The supermarket was reconfigured with new protocols for moving through the aisles and waiting for checkout. Not too crowded, and almost everything I needed was there. Pasta is now the item in short supply. They had lots of cleaning products, I chose three, but they would only let me buy one. I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Freak-Cleaning-Multi-Surface-Starter/dp/B07PHL372F&quot;&gt;Clean Freak&lt;/a&gt; because I loved the concept and the name. Yes packaging and branding still matter, even in post-apocalypse America. The only bacon they had was maple-flavored. Never heard of such a thing. On coming home I fried some up, and now the whole house smells of maple syrup. Not a good thing imho. Also -- they had toilet paper. Everyone I saw got some.</description>

			<title>Signed up for Medicare</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just completed signing up for Medicare including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans&quot;&gt;Medicare Advantage Plan&lt;/a&gt;. My two cents. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XKoar34gBI&quot;&gt;Bernie says&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Medicare for All&quot; -- no I don't think so. It's a bastard child. Complicated and convoluted. Obviously something that has been fought over repeatedly in Congress. And in the end, after getting educated, and coming back again and again, I did what everyone seems to, shrug their shoulders, pick a plan and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The medical system should work like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You need health care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You get health care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That's it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Medicare isn't that. It's way better than I what I've had until now, ObamaCare, which was a vast improvement over what I had before that (I'd call it Maybe I'm Covered We'll Find Out When I Need It-care). It feels like graduating, finally I get treated like I matter, a little. And I'm pretty sure that if I get in deep shit medically I will be helped. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But why should you have to wait until you're 65 to get that?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm not 65 yet, but soon. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: It feels like that great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3XX_z5wZn0&quot;&gt;moment&lt;/a&gt; in Goodfellas where Paulie says to young Henry Hill &quot;You broke your cherry!&quot; Basically every moment in Goodfellas is a great moment, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Glitch, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Lots more info about running Glitch apps &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, so far the only big limit I've learned about with Glitch is the inability to map an IP address to an app. But this may not be a problem because I use Hover as my registrar and DNS, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html?title=theyCanMap&quot;&gt;they can map&lt;/a&gt; a top level domain using a CNAME. So you could say make mydomain.com point to a Glitch app.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Horror film plot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Plot for a techno scifi horror film/retro political thriller.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Russia buys a famous movie studio that contracts with HBO to do a sequel to Breaking Bad. The season finale is broadcast with much fanfare on a Sunday night. Everyone is watching, esp people in skyscraper apartment buildings in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The opening scene has soldiers marching slowly across a very very very long bridge. They deliberately lower the volume on the broadcast so everyone turns up the volume on their super sound systems esp in those NYC skyscraper apartment buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They gradually increase the volume, causing the NYC apartment buildings to vibrate in sympathy with the marching soldiers, but the people don't notice because it's Breaking Bad and they &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; Breaking Bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The buildings undulate and sway and finally they all come down in a crash of the NYC skyline. Trump Tower collapses too, and the president, heartbroken, collapses and dies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Russia wins.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Certainly worth checking out now as more than a curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there a simple no-frills doc that explains the model for apps. How the filesystem works, how to access an app over HTTP. Can my app have an IP address? How do I know what port to use (port 80 gets me an error). I have succeeded at connecting to my app over HTTP but it comes embedded in something they constructed. Obviously this won't work for serving my non-experimental apps. I understand it's set up for newbies, that's cool. Now how do I strip it down so it works for its new intended purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168&quot;&gt;thread here&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>A current-day NYC story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;From a friend in the city...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I just woke up about an hour ago, and really needing coffee and a bagel, so I put on my mask and went to my nearby bakery. Three people were inside, none wearing masks; I waited for two to leave then stepped in carefully. The remaining customer was a middle-aged woman who seemed to be speaking in great detail to the worker helping her, and getting very close to be heard, maybe 3 feet. The employees were all wearing masks (the crappy surgical mask type) but she wasn't. Then she went to pay and checkout and seemed to have another intensive conversation at 3 feet away from the employee at the register.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I thought I probably should have said something, I was still three quarters asleep at that point, but what should I have done in that situation? Did that woman already get sick and figured she didn't need to be careful? Was she a Trump supporter who wanted to flaunt the rules? Something in-between, or just a jerk? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Help me figure out what I should do the next time that happens, maybe you can crowdsource this to your readers? I want to clearly communicate to that person that her mouth is a lethal weapon, and that the bakery employees didn't deserve to be &quot;shot at&quot; just to be paid their 12 or 15 bucks an hour... but, you know, nicely. Thanks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Silver lining: that bagel was amazing, something about the 0.001% chance of dying really makes it that much better!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have an idea post a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/167&quot;&gt;note here&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a couple of mine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My fantasy answer comes from having ridden a bike in urban areas for many years. I dream of carrying a can of red spray paint with me, and when someone comes too close with their car and I have to slam on the brakes to avoid getting run over, I whip out the paint and put a red stripe on their fender or bumper. Then they would have to explain to friends and family how they got the red stripe. Shitty drivers would end up with &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to admit I once hit a guy's car with a stick on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@37.406063,-122.2491704,3a,75y,5.42h,91.82t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s_EmimMiikqlcJp5LPKtj1A!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3D_EmimMiikqlcJp5LPKtj1A%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D59.450317%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Mountain Home Road&lt;/a&gt; in Woodside. They get very upset when you touch their car. But he was in my space, I had to move out of his way to avoid getting hit. There was no reason for it, no car on the other side of the double-yellow lines. He was either really sloppy or trying to fuck with me. He pulled over, started coming toward me, and then stopped, presumably when he saw I was much larger than him. The car gives you a sense of size-of-body that isn't realistic. I told him to get back in his car and drive away, which he did. I may have actually dreamed this, not sure.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What Trump will do is not impotent or unobvious. He decrees (say) May 10 to be the date to re-open. States that don't re-open won't get any stimulus money. If you won't help yourselves, he'll say, why should the Federal government help you? That will &quot;make sense&quot; to his base as they rush off to their deaths. What happens after that, I don't imagine Trump has thought through.</description>

And they do: we're at over 3,600 members now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are plenty of others who have the same core belief, from Texas Tribune to VT Digger to Bridge Magazine. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We're still digging! &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The pricing model of online pubs is as if each is publishing a whole magazine or newspaper, as they did before the web. I'm sure that's still their internal model, how their organizations work, but it's not the way we read them. We read an article here, another one there. Their pricing is utterly inflexible. It's a shame to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/rahm_emanuel_409199&quot;&gt;waste a crisis&lt;/a&gt;. We need information like never before. And they need money because advertising is evaporating. Can't we arrive at a compromise?</description>

			<description>It would be smart imho for them to finally allow us to subscribe centrally so we didn't have to create accounts on each site. They have been unwilling to budge on this. I bet there's a ton of revenue out there they can have if each of them would stop trying to be world dominant.</description>

			<description>Stop everything and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1249336590482243585&quot;&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; this presentation by Prime Minister Johnson of the UK. Incredibly powerful, credible, a perfect call for the British people. Now maybe he can knock some sense into the Republican leadership in the US. Also doesn't this make you wish we had an NHS in the US. I thought this was such a noteworthy speech we added it to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo podcast&lt;/a&gt; as a &quot;special enclosure.&quot;</description>

			<title>Zip work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I posted this earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I need to zip up a set of files in Node. Why isn't there a drop-dead simple API for doing this. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa50ae77b8929bcad55c8b7125a6f3ba&quot;&gt;pseudo code&lt;/a&gt; for how I'd like to do it.

			<description>I am listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdEQkRq_xrw&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; a lot these days. &quot;Burn down the mission If we're gonna stay alive. Watch the black smoke fly to heaven. See the red flame light the sky.&quot; A theme song for this era. We're going to have to burn it down. We've been putting it off for too long and now are living with the consequences. That's why this hurts so much, we created this moment as much as the Tea Party people did.</description>

			<description>It took about a half hour to realize the thermometer I got in the mail today was not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvs.com/shop/kinsa-quickcare-smart-digital-thermometer-for-all-ages-prodid-2180122&quot;&gt;Kinsa thermometer&lt;/a&gt; and that's why I couldn't configure the Kinsa app to talk to it. D'oh. God is goofing on me today. I ordered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085Y6H3CZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;thermometer&lt;/a&gt; in March as a test to see if the world would still be here in May. Haha joke's on me, it is. PS: It got here a month early.</description>

			<description>I have mixed feelings about our demonstrations for health care workers. It could be interpreted not so much as appreciation as &quot;please save us.&quot;  The health care worker might resent this. I would. Why couldn't you heed the warning sooner? But it's good because it's a reminder to ourselves that there will be no simplistic solution to this problem. The applause is for us, for having the resolve and discipline to stick with it. And knowing no matter how painful it is for us, we have it easy.</description>

			<description>There's a myth that every dollar the government spends is from taxes, i.e. &lt;i&gt;taxpayer money. &lt;/i&gt;Far from it, It's at least partially invented money or borrowed money, esp when it comes to bailouts and pointless wars. It's all good when the money is invested in a positive way, that creates growth, or value for the citizens of the country, now and especially future. Education is one great example, health care, and esp public health (as we're learning now). When we burn the money by blowing up far-away countries, or give the money to big companies for no reason, or the super-rich, it does nothing for us, or really for them. It's like scattering the money to the wind.</description>
