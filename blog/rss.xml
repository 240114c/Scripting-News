			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/silentmoviegifs&quot;&gt;Silent Movie GIFs&lt;/a&gt; is great. They show you tiny scenes from a silent movie, and then another and another, spaced out over hours. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/silentmoviegifs/status/1017446111571841025&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Keaton&quot;&gt;Buster Keaton&lt;/a&gt; movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Week_(1920_film)&quot;&gt;One Week&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I did a bit more development work &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/12.html#a142546&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; on a project that stores stuff on GitHub as if it were a long-term place, a place to create a historic record. Of course I question that, I did when they were an independent company. Now that GitHub is owned by Microsoft, I still question it. Not sure if it's more or less likely to survive as-is for the indefinite future. Made me wonder what Microsoft could do to reassure developers, so we'd feel comfortable treating it as a permanent resource. Clearly that's in their interest. Microsoft has embraced open source, now I wonder if they have what it takes to be a leader.</description>

			<description>I wonder why more American congresspeople donâ€™t have blogs and podcasts. It seems they would want to communicate regularly with their constituents. Twitter has severe limits, as everyone knows.</description>

			<description>I'm now archiving the RSS file for Scripting News &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/rss.xml&quot;&gt;in the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, every night, along with the content of the blog for the day (in JSON, OPML and HTML). It'll be interesting to be able to track the changes to the file over (knock wood) long periods of time. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolNightly/blob/master/oldschoolnightly.js&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; of the app that does the uploading. It's proven to be very reliable. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Real ideas yesterday on MSNBC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the time I spend watching MSNBC is a waste, but yesterday there were two items that were important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On MTP Daily, an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/mtp-daily/watch/rounds-sounds-the-alarm-on-trump-trade-strategy-1275006531827&quot;&gt;Senator Mike Rounds, R-SD&lt;/a&gt;, carefully explaining how Trump still has the support of his constituents, but they don't like what he's doing with tariffs. I think this is a must-listen, a real milestone, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On The Beat, author &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber/watch/trump-baby-blimp-organizer-moral-outrage-doesn-t-work-on-trump-1275099715785&quot;&gt;Tony Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, interviewed about the angry Trump baby blimp in London, said it's funny (it is!) but is far from where we should be focused. He says getting non-voters to vote is where our attention should be. Couldn't agree more. I want a system, where voters have buddies, like sponsors in a 12-step program, who they commit to voting, and they engage on Election Day and make sure they do. They escort them to the poll if necessary. We should have drills. What an incredible demonstration that would be. Far more powerful than a march. Think about it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A mutual defense pact against racism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A Twitter account called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BlkAndPr0ud/status/1016367865400832000&quot;&gt;Black and Proud&lt;/a&gt; addresses white people: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please stop saying 'I don't see color.' Instead -- I see you and your struggle, because of your skin color. I will stand with you to end racism. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I agree. Race &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; visible, and the statement that you don't see it is ludicrous. We see it. To say otherwise is to push it aside. I've written about this a few times before, once in an explainer about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/17/0880.html&quot;&gt;Black Lives Matter&lt;/a&gt;, and what it means, from a white person's perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to do more. I feel compelled, not just to make life safer and simpler for people of color, but also to put up a roadblock to racism, to let it know that it will encounter resistance. Some things are better kept under cover. Racism for sure is one of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the past I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; that we all wear Martin Luther King buttons. I felt his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/09/mlk.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; was perfect because he's a black man, he preached non-violence, and was active, not passive, in his quest for equality and fairness. A white person wearing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/09/mlk.png&quot;&gt;MLK button&lt;/a&gt; makes a statement of equivalence. Treat me as you would treat a black person. If a majority of whites wore these buttons it would make a promise to our fellow citizens, that if there's trouble, we're standing with you. &lt;i&gt;When&lt;/i&gt; there's trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be like Article 5 in NATO. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. As a white person I can't become black. But I can make a statement that I stand with people of color. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The other day I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/09/143533.html&quot;&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; for the canonical &lt;a href=&quot;http://hosting.opml.org/dave/spec/states.opml&quot;&gt;states.opml&lt;/a&gt; file, the one that I use to test structures of outlines with. I found what appears to be the original copy, dated 12/2/2000. It's now &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/states/states.opml&quot;&gt;accessible&lt;/a&gt; through this.how, which is served by PagePark, using its built-in ability to render OPML files.

			<description>Re winning in November. In 2008, Obama had a social network of voters who met, knocked on doors, arranged a buddy system for people to vote. We should reboot that, only do it better. It's 2018, and the technology and our know-how have improved a lot.</description>

			<description>As we get accustomed to a Putin-run American government, where are our Russian counterparts -- the protestors, the democracy advocates, to school us on how to really resist the dawning nightmare. It seems there are voices missing from our conversation</description>

			<title>Parallels betw Russia and Germany</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I haven't heard this mentioned elsewhere, but there are parallels to where we're at now and at the beginning of World War II. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Russia, like Germany had been defeated and humiliated. Out of that rose a strongman, who has territorial ambitions in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As in the 1930s, the US is isolationist. This time we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO&quot;&gt;defense pact&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like we're going to withdraw from that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What it means for Europe is that they're heading for government like that in Russia, and without a strong adversary, an unchecked Russia won't stop before it runs over all of Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the relevant dates. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles&quot;&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; was in 1919 and the first territory grab by Germany was the annexation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss&quot;&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; in 1938. 19 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The collapse of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; was in 1991, and the annexation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation&quot;&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt; was in 2014. 23 years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Listening</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things we learned in massage school, many years ago, was how to listen. There was an exercise I always try to remember when it's time to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The group separates into pairs. Seated on mats on the floor. Spines straight, head straight, not tilted in or out or to a side. One person speaks and the other listens. The speaker just talks, no rules there. Share whatever you want. Anything. The listener says nothing. Your body doesn't move in or out. No hugging, touching, no words. Your eyes stay neutral. No facial expressions. No empathy, no approval or disapproval, just hear what the other person is saying. Understand that they are this person's words. No response is allowed.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These days, when it's time to listen, I allow myself to put a hand across my mouth as a signal to my subconscious that it's time to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What made me think of this today? I listened to the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/&quot;&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; podcast, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/617/fermis-paradox/act-two-2&quot;&gt;second segment&lt;/a&gt; was a couple's therapy session. One was speaking, the other wasn't listening. If you're in a troubled relationship, I highly recommend the podcast. And if you can find someone who will pair with you on the listening exercise, above, I recommend that as well. You may be surprised how hard it is to stay centered, neutral, just listen, not go in or out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/10/27/listeningIsHard&quot;&gt;Listening is hard&lt;/a&gt;. If more people learned how to do it, we'd be better off. There would more love. People would understand that their friends and partners are real people, not just screens for projecting their movies on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>For years I was really confused about what blogging is, after Twitter and Facebook. In May last year I decided I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; my old blog back, the one I started in 1997. Now, a year later, I realize it really works. The 280 char limit in Twitter helps because I can cross-post shorter posts there. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/09/blogScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Just did a little shopping. Went to Whole Foods to pick up fruit, bread, Italian sparkling water (a habit I developed on my recent trip). I used the newly installed Whole Foods app using my Amazon ID to get a discount. I used Apple Pay to pay for it. On my way out the store I used the Starbuck's app to buy an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/09/coffeeLabel.png&quot;&gt;iced coffee&lt;/a&gt; and breakfast sandwich, which was there when I arrived two minutes later. I remarked to the checkout guy at Whole Foods that this is the future. He asked if I was a robot. I thought a bit, smiled, and said yeah almost. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>How Twitter displays threads</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I tried an experiment to see how Twitter displays thread structures. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I entered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/07/09/statesSubset.png&quot;&gt;subset&lt;/a&gt; of the standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/states/states.opml&quot;&gt;states outline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Twittergram/status/1016328508128288768&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is at the root. It has one sub, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Twittergram/status/1016328530328805377&quot;&gt;Far West&lt;/a&gt;. And from there I list the six states, and provide detail under &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Twittergram/status/1016328618899902464&quot;&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering what the algorithm is. Because sometimes it shows nodes at multiple levels, and how they choose them isn't clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the things I liked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag&quot;&gt;Fleabag&lt;/a&gt;, which I just finished, is that all the characters are trying so hard, but the punchline of the six-part series, which I won't spoil, is given to a middle-aged man. So often men are portrayed as childish, clueless and mean. It's nice to see a story, one that centers on women, but lets men have dignity and wisdom while being vulnerable and wanting to be happy. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>We're complicit</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the 90s, when Microsoft was doing horrible things to the web and hoping to get away with it, I had friends who worked there. I often wondered how they explained it to themselves. They must know that what Microsoft is doing is wrong, and those of us outside of the company don't make a distinction they would probably like us to make. I didn't see a difference between the company and the people who worked there. It was hard to reconcile the affection I felt for them personally with the actions of the company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I mention this now, long after the events are past, because of an image and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/1015951386050224130&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that showed that thousands of people in Brussels are marching against our president. I thought, that's cool, but soon they will be marching against the United States. They won't and shouldn't make a distinction between the country and our president, for the same reason we didn't make a distinction between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates&quot;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; and the people who worked at Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you go to Europe, there isn't a change in attitude that you can perceive. I went there when we invaded Iraq, creating the refugee crisis that is now causing so many problems there. No one seemed to blame me for what our government was doing. Same thing in June when I visited Italy. People seem to understand that Americans who travel outside the United States aren't to blame for Trump. But in fact, &lt;i&gt;we are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We could do more to stop Trump. We're all &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1015987159642394625&quot;&gt;hoping&lt;/a&gt; to continue with our lives and careers, that somehow we'll get through this without having to give up anything as individuals. That someone else will make the sacrifice. I don't think that's how it works. We're missing chance after chance to stop this. We all have to work for each other, not just for ourselves. This is a change that Americans are not yet ready to make. I hope when and if it happens it isn't too late. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of all the deliverables for the restoration.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/restoration2012/storylist.html&quot;&gt;A list of all the stories&lt;/a&gt;, on scripting.com.

There are a bunch more that weren't restored because they're already present, but we didn't have the OPML for them before. Note, it takes a long time to load, the file is quite large.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I also uploaded the OPML file to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/misc/restoration2012/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repository. It also has trouble with the size of the file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I uploaded the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/restoration2012/renderedPages.zip&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; containing the newly restored pages in HTML.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Restoring posts from 2012-13</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to take notes here as I do this work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Finding the OPML source for the stories&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In doing the restoration of threads2 yesterday I got distracted, because the stories were in a special place not in scripting.com, which is a bucket on Amazon S3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I used a special dynamic server then. Now I want to archive them like all the other posts. Some features are not preserved, such as comments and paragraph-level permalinks. However it is an improvement over what was here previously, i.e. nothing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, I wanted to see if I could find the OPML for each of the stories. That took a bit of detective work, because they were in a worldoutline structure, but they were safe, in another S3 bucket, fargo.io. Long story how they came to be there. But I had left a crumb trail, deliberately, so that if someone wanted to find the source, not only would it likely still be there, but it would be relatively easy to find. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Next step is to generate pages for each of the stories in preparation for putting them in a logical place, as HTML and OPML, in the scripting.com bucket.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Working on a template and build script&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have one working locally, now have to set it up so it iterates over all the stories. Taking a break for a bit. Back soon.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Should finish tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was too nice a day in NYC to spend the day indoors. I did do a bit more work, and here's the outline for what I have left to do, tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At about 8PM I have all the pages building and have a script that uploads them. Tomorrow I want to generate the redirects from the old threads website, and do some testing. I'll also release the OPML source code through the Scripting-News repository. This post will be linked to from every page that was part of the restoration. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Something changed somewhere and the blogging I was doing in 2012 and 2013 stopped working. Turns out that files without extensions were previously interpreted as text/html even if the returned Content-Type was text/plain. So I added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/config.md#setting-the-default-content-type-for-a-domain&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagepark&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; that lets you set the default type for a site. That was what was needed. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/&quot;&gt;list of the posts&lt;/a&gt; from March 2013 that now should work properly, again. When you have as much web history as I do, keeping things running is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvEexTomE1I&quot;&gt;a lot of work&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I'm reading some of the pieces that have just come back online. For example this one -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/goodSoftwareDesignIsAgeless&quot;&gt;good software design is ageless&lt;/a&gt;. It talks about removing features from software, and how that breaks users. I think I understood why that happens when I wrote the piece, but disclaimed it. It's because the people who do the breaking weren't the ones who fought for the users, who made the product successful. They don't have a feel for how much they had to do to get them to commit. We're having the same argument over and over, when a new generation comes of age and wants to throw out the accomplishments previous generations made.

I read an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/07/06/gateway-tunnel-new-york-city-infrastructure-218839&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; today about a pair of 100-plus-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_River_Tunnels&quot;&gt;tunnels&lt;/a&gt; under the Hudson River, and now if they fail it will do severe damage to the country's economy. We have similar technology in software. But we wreck the tunnels, willfully, every generation. This is why progress is so elusive, and also imho why people don't trust tech.</description>

			<source:outline text="I'm reading some of the pieces that have just come back online. For example this one -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/goodSoftwareDesignIsAgeless&quot;&gt;good software design is ageless&lt;/a&gt;. It talks about removing features from software, and how that breaks users. I think I understood why that happens when I wrote the piece, but disclaimed it. It's because the people who do the breaking weren't the ones who fought for the users, who made the product successful. They don't have a feel for how much they had to do to get them to commit. We're having the same argument over and over, when a new generation comes of age and wants to throw out the accomplishments previous generations made. I don't know why software is particularly afflicted by this.

			<description>Sad day. Twitter suspended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyt&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt; account. I've been running that since long before they were on Twitter. They knew about it. I offered to let them have it, but they said no. I guess someone there must have complained? Who knows. It's a corporate world.</description>

			<description>I love it when I find a bug in four-year-old code. Today, the culprit was a routine called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/master/daveutils.js#L564&quot;&gt;decodeXml&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveutils&quot;&gt;daveutils&lt;/a&gt;.

I would have liked it because the CEO of Be was an outliner guy. Blogging would have found a natural home there.

This showed in an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/riverToTweets&quot;&gt;riverToTweets&lt;/a&gt;, which routes tweets from rivers to Twitter accounts, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyt&quot;&gt;nyt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nbariver&quot;&gt;nbariver&lt;/a&gt;.

I had seen this for a long time and assumed the problem was deeply buried in a utility I didn't care a lot about, but it turns out it was in code that's included in almost every project I do, including sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. It's now fixed and deployed. Not every app has been updated yet to include the fix. These are the best bugs to fix.

			<description>Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/86&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about converting WordPress sites has a lot of good practice in it. It's so complete that I'd say that wp.com sets the standard today for blog portability and limited lock-in. If someday you need to leave WordPress, you should be able to do it. Now someone needs to put a Medium-like UI on WordPress and we'll have an answer for people who insist on using for on-the-record writing. WordPress is a much better place to do that, imho.</description>

			<description>I love the NBA, and this is by far the best part of the season which is an interesting statement, because the NBA isn't playing basketball right now. They're playing power and money. The money is huge and the power is shifting. The Lakers get LeBron because of Magic, Kobe, Shaq, Kareem, Wilt, Jerry, Phil and Pat et al. And Golden State gets Cousins because  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbnation.com/2018/7/3/17529428/demarcus-cousins-signs-warriors-nba-free-agency-reactions&quot;&gt;they can&lt;/a&gt;. So many interesting conversations to be had. I've heard it said that the East is now a backwater, but wait until a western star realizes they can play a completely different game in the East. Free agency isn't over yet for 2018. And I can't wait to see Philadelphia and Boston compete, and somehow hope the Knicks get into it, but so far, not.</description>

			<description>I asked a couple of questions &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1014121937533046784&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; about wordpress.com and Tumblr, two blog hosting sites that seem like they might allow authors freedom to move. What you want is the same freedom you get from an email service -- when its time to move, you can forward all requests to the new service. I've posted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/86&quot;&gt;same questions&lt;/a&gt; in the issues section of the repo for this blog. Turns out it isn't that simple, and while WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pmaiorana/status/1014123762441228288&quot;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; to do it, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thDigitalReader/status/1014125804148658176&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of their users says they don't.

			<description>Did you know you can download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; for Scripting News in OPML? Every month I refresh the archive in my GitHub repository. I started doing this when I switched to the new blogging &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; in May 2017. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2018/06.opml&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; for last month.</description>

			<description>A spontaneous &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1013990253395435521&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, late at night, Eastern time in North America. They're just waking up now in Europe. I'm tweeting and reading, watching Rachel on the second monitor, also watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://artshow.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Art Show&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>We need TBL, and you..</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I read the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;TBL&lt;/a&gt; and posted it to my linkblog. I appreciate the invention of the web. It came at just the right time. I had been knocked out of the software game by Apple. The software I made threatened them, so they launched a competitor. I was looking for a platform without a platform vendor, and had no hope of ever finding one, when just the right thing showed up -- the web. You can see my excitement in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;early posts&lt;/a&gt; to DaveNet, my early weblog and email newsletter, in 1994. But where is Tim now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is attempting to corporatize the web platform? He's still talking about writing software that will fix the problem. At this point software won't do it, imho. Way too late for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need &lt;i&gt;him, &lt;/i&gt;and we need everyone else who profited from the open web. Why am I the only one &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;protesting&lt;/a&gt;? Could it be that everyone else hopes to get a job from Google? Or a grant? Aren't you aware of how much we depend on the open ecosystem? And how fragile it is? Could it be they don't remember that Google loses interest in projects that we depend on and dumps them? It's one thing when they created the thing they dump, but quite another when it's something that was once a public resource that they took over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will be fighting for our freedom for the rest of our lives. But this is an easy battle to win. If enough thought leaders speak out in favor of the open web now, I think Google will back down. Let's get them to the table where we can talk creatively about the problem they see, and find a way to solve it wtihout them taking over the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all guests here, and guests don't make the rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing to do is to write a blog post in support of the open web. Send me a link if you like. I will read it. Let's start small and build it up. I shouldn't be the only one speaking out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Have you been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JimCarrey/&quot;&gt;Jim Carrey&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter? If not, please do. Turns out he's an incredible political cartoonist, and it goes beyond cartooning, it's art, it's very dark and irreverent. Wonderful stuff. I see a connection between this and &lt;a href=&quot;http://artshow.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Art Show&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps.</description>
