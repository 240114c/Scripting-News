			<description>We're righteously upset about the Chinese government interfering with the NBA and speech in the US. But what about the NFL? They're here at home, and are punishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick&quot;&gt;Colin Kaepernick&lt;/a&gt;, and his fans, for speech. Football is a luxury, it's optional. Would you give up a week of NFL games to support Kaepernick?</description>

			<title>Amazon Fire Cube :-1:</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/08.html#a135920&quot;&gt;excited&lt;/a&gt; to get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KGVB6D6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Fire Cube&lt;/a&gt;, but after a short installation and exploration, I realized it was nowhere near as good as it has to be to earn a place in my living room. I'm going to return it and instead buy a current Apple TV. I'll report on that later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Re the Cube, it has to compete with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+roku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; user interface that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;baked into&lt;/a&gt; my TCL screen. It clearly has this ambition, when it sets itself up, it remarkably figures out how to turn on and off the TV and my Onkyo receiver. I think this is a combination of better standards and testing. Impressive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But when their desktop appears, it's a confusing mess, and in every way assumes what you want is Amazon Prime Video, even though it has Netflix and other apps. They clearly are biased. Understandable, but not functional. I come to them from a world where they don't control me, so it's a turnoff. I'm just as likely to watch something on HBO Go or Netflix as on Prime. Their desktop should be more agnostic. It's okay to put your app first in the list, but really that's as far as it should go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if the Spectrum app for Fire worked better than the Roku one, but I couldn't figure out through their app store interface how to search for an app by name. That's ridiculous. They understand the importance of search in other places, but not here? I couldn't figure out which class of app a cable provider would fall under. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I tried the Alexa functionality. It's weird that it must have talked to the other two Alexas in my house to figure out how to connect over my wifi. I never had to enter a password. This spooked me. This Alexa works differently and it's hard of hearing! I couldn't figure out how to get it to stop without unplugging it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they must have special problems with an environment where other speakers are present, but they weren't making any sound when I was trying to communicate with it. And the Alexa in the kitchen sometimes heard and responded to my queries, so it's pretty clear that having two Alexas in adjacent rooms isn't going to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I then went back to Roku's desktop and breathed a sigh of relief, and decided the Fire Cube sucks. I don't want it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Blogs are little things</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had a long-term problem with comments on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. If I have open comments then I have to moderate them. It helps to have clearly published &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which I do, that eliminates most of the emotional reactions, but some still get through, and people can hold grudges for a long time. I don't like editing other people. I already do more of this kind of work than I want to. My goal is to get rid of all of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I first started out I had a pretty optimal system. The posts went out via email to small groups of subscribers. You could respond, and I would see your response and so would the others in your group. Sometimes interesting discussions would take place. For some reason very little flaming. I lurked. When someone wrote a piece I thought should get on the record, I'd forward it to an email address that was monitored by a script I wrote, which would then add it to the current &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/mail/default.html&quot;&gt;mail page&lt;/a&gt;. It wouldn't publish until I had a chance to hand-edit the text. It was work, and I remember not liking it, but there were some real classics among the mail page posts, so I did the work, for a couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could re-implement the Mail Pages, but it's not something I want to do, and it would be harder today, given the way email worked then and now. It's gotten more complex. I also had a scriptable email app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(email_client)&quot;&gt;Eurdora&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to write the whole thing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; which was really good at driving scriptable Mac apps. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so now here we are in 2019, and I have an excellent use-case. I wrote a short &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/08.html#a140651&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Medicare, asking for input, and have gotten back some wonderful responses. One in particular was beautifully written, long, detailed and obviously based on a lot of experience. As I read such an email I ache a little. &quot;This should be on the web,&quot; I think to myself. Finally when I get to the end I respond with praise, and a request that they post it to their blog. I put it that way because 1. maybe they have a blog or 2. maybe this will get them to start one. But the most likely response is a story about how they have a blog, but haven't posted to it in a long time and they feel guilty, so presumably they don't want to go there for some reason? I don't really get it, because I know what a blog is, behind the scenes. It isn't a place. It's just a few files on a server, very small files, and a few database entries perhaps. The reason companies like Automattic and Google host blogs for free is that's how much it costs to host one a blog. It really is of no consequence.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You imagine that your blog is lonely and angry that you're not visiting, but that's  purely a figment of your imagination. The blog doesn't exist in any &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=corporeal&quot;&gt;corporeal&lt;/a&gt; sense. It has no thoughts or feelings. I doesn't give a shit if you live or die, because it doesn't have an ego, it doesn't care about &lt;i&gt;anything. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of creating a blog as you would think of writing on a page in a notepad. Or scribbling on the back of an envelope and handing it to someone. It takes two minutes at most to create a blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/create-blog/&quot;&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. And from then on, you have a &quot;place&quot; to post emails you that are post-worthy (I will tell you if they are). Then you can send me a link and I can put it on my linkblog page, and send it to my Twitter followers, and people who read me on RSS, and in the nightly email. It might be more flow than you'd get from posting it on Medium, for example. And if I asked you to post it, that's almost a guarantee that I will circulate the link.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have created lots of one-off blogs and I'd do it again in a heartbeat, esp if it meant we could make the world a better place, or at least more informed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Should we think of Twitter as part of the open web for the purpose of linking? I ask because I found that something I pointed to, and embedded in my blog, that I felt was historic, was on an account that Twitter suspended. The tweet was no longer available. I understand why Twitter needs to suspend accounts, but do they have to get rid of all the previous posts? Does Twitter care about the web? Do they want to be part of it?</description>

			<description>I had to do a lot of driving today and listened to two Daily podcasts back to back, which should be listened to together, imho. The first was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/podcasts/the-daily/impeachment-inquiry-democrats-republicans-kavanaugh.html&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of the Republican strategist who managed the Kavanaugh confirmation and who is now leading the impeachment defense for Repubs. It was infuriating, esp the way the Times reported it. In the second podcast they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/podcasts/the-daily/house-democrats-elissa-slotkin.html&quot;&gt;followed&lt;/a&gt; one of the pivotal Democratic reps, from Michigan, as she met with constituents at two town halls. The hot topic was impeachment. What was so fascinating is that you can hear, quite clearly, the result of the propoganda from the subject of the first podcast that is &lt;s&gt;informing&lt;/s&gt; enraging the anti-impeachment voters. The rep was admirable, made me proud to be an American, a contrast to the first, who made me feel there's no hope for our country.</description>

			<description>When the Repubs say that impeachment is just a way to undo the 2016 election, they overlook the 2018 election, which was most definitely an attempt, by the voters, to undo the mistake of 2016. The only reason the House can contemplate impeaching Trump is that there is a Democratic majority. That happened in 2018.</description>

So much of what happens and what's said went over my head the first time. And there are forward references you couldn't have caught the first time through. Watch it with captioning on, that helps too.  Also it's a comedy with the skeleton of a tragedy. I found myself laughing out loud at times as if it were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qvXvDfGnh8&quot;&gt;Monty Python&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😆&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Rambling about search</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if anyone has Wikipedia as their default search page. It just occurred to me, with Google searches getting more cluttered with garbage all the time, if Wikipedia might not be a better choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Brooklyn+Nets&quot;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; for Brooklyn Nets, and here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;. Which gets you a better set of links to topics related to the team? I guess the problem is there are no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Brooklyn+Nets&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNSE5Kh8llhcwE0qiVXY-kOCFflhgA:1570632411345&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiur83XtY_lAhUFmeAKHQe_CtEQ_AUIEigB&amp;biw=1491&amp;bih=1044&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Brooklyn+Nets&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;tbm=vid&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNSvPhpiJUug7r-OEOCG7s8v5pJzsw:1570632442181&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPu6fmtY_lAhXNVt8KHQpyDXIQ_AUIDSgE&amp;biw=1491&amp;bih=1044&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Brooklyn+Nets&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNQaQdHDQ3rbD6fMW6sKZug8sLNgnQ:1570632455181&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO6cDstY_lAhUonuAKHdc5DiwQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1491&amp;bih=1044&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; options on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I probably should just start using &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Brooklyn+Nets&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;. It's very similar to Google, but not as insane, and they claim to not share your search habits with any other companies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You know what would really get me to switch? Customization. If I could tell it where my blog is, so it will default to showing me what I had written about a topic at the top of the search, or offer a tab that allowed me to quickly review my own writing. I could see that changing the nature of everything I do on the web, it would also be an incentive to people to leave the silos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd also like a pref that lets me ask it to always show me the Wikipedia page first. Other people might prefer a Twitter account first, or news about the topic. Google makes all these choices for you. But I'm a sentient user, I was using computers for decades before Google even existed. I know how to program, and yet, I can't use that skill on the most extensive information source ever produced by humans -- the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I ordered a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KGVB6D6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Amazon Fire Cube&lt;/a&gt;. I have a relatively old Apple TV, and was looking to upgrade because of a problem I'm having with the Roku version of the Spectrum app. I'm 99% sure the problem is with Spectrum, whose support people point the finger at Roku, which I think is BS. I considered buying a new Apple TV, but I've been using Alexa more and  more, and I find I miss it on my TV-watching system in the living room. This tells you something about how Amazon is moving to dominate TV. People think Trump is the new boss, but I'm pretty sure it's Bezos. Imagine if they bought Roku, which is the OS of my TCL television. Imagine if the OS goes down another level and takes Spectrum out of the software-development business (and I assume Verizon et al) which would be a blessing. They really don't do this very well. The wild card, the one company that could redefine news is Twitter, as I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/07/165641.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder if anyone in the future-of-news world has comments?</description>

I wonder if anyone in the future-of-news world has comments?" created="Tue, 08 Oct 2019 13:59:20 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/08/amazonFireCube.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/10/08.html#a135920"/>

			<description>A long &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21178885#21179244&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Hacker News about yesterday's anniversary. One commenter said &quot;I feel bad for Dave. He was so early to the table on so many occasions yet he was left behind and never really made it big monetarily. He is the definition of missing the boat.&quot; I replied &quot;Please don't feel bad. I was never trying to make a lot of money from the web. I had lots of opportunities to sell out. I did that once, in the 80s, and that has funded my creative work ever since. Money isn't that useful, I learned, pretty early-on. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about that recently.&quot; I'd add that I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; disappointed that when the VCs started RSS companies and then podcast companies, they did it with other people, with imho predictably bad results. That was disappointing, but what the hell, no one made any money from those things, and I get to enjoy the podcasts and feeds as much as anyone. And for that I'm grateful. I also wish people like Zuckerberg cared more about the ecosystem, but he and I look at the world differently.</description>

			<description>I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, which I'm sure if you read this blog, you now know and wish I'd stop mentioning. Heh. One more time. I was 39 years old then, an age that to me now seems impossibly young, but to me at the time, felt really &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; old. I'm 25 years older now, 64, and in the US a lot of shit happens at 65, most important to me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Medicare&amp;t=hz&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently at that point, the cost of my health insurance will go down dramatically, and the coverage will go up dramatically. Not that I feel I'm wanting any medical care now that I can't get, and I can certainly afford the payments. Anyway this an awkard moment because I have no idea what the fuck Medicare actually is. I go to the websites and they tell me how much I have to learn, but they don't teach it. I am highly motivated to learn, but I'd love to have a user interface that was like GEICO's website for buying auto insurance, or the Digital Ocean page for sizing your applet. I'd like to just check off some boxes, and see the numbers change. If I want to spend $500 per month I could have this coverage, or that, or something else. It seems enough people go through this that it's worth a little investment?</description>

			<description>On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer Show&lt;/a&gt; this morning the question came up of why Trump released the &quot;transcript&quot; of his talk with the Ukranian president. I have a theory about that which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1181212175513346049&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; to the show. It goes like this. Trump approved of its release without reading the transcript, or listening to his advisors. They wanted it released because it prevents Trump from throwing them under the bus. It's the new reality of a president who has the attention span of a gnat. Sometimes that works against him more than it works against us.</description>

			<description>Theory why Repubs don't stand up to Trump. After the 2016 election, the Russian &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Measures_(film)&quot;&gt;active measures&lt;/a&gt; campaign turned to building &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat&quot;&gt;kompromat&lt;/a&gt; on every Republican member of Congress.

			<title>Dear Jack, installment 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; subscribes to the email version of this blog, so I've started writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/30/132753.html&quot;&gt;directly to him&lt;/a&gt; in an open format. I'd do the same for the CEOs of any other tech firm whose products I use. Free consulting. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I find myself hooking into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PitchingNinja/status/1181268716056657925&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter more and more. Like this ridiculous annoying exasperating &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1181249348824379393&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with a Bush-era Republican, shilling for Trump while trying to sound reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More and more, news orgs are posting short bits of video to Twitter. It's growing, and that's imho good.  Further, Twitter has a good API and it's relatively stable and liberal. I've thought for a long time that their API is their big advantage. As a developer I'd like to see them do more with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a new kind of TV news looking for the right user interface. I don't think Moments is the answer. I think Checkbox News is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/checkboxNews.html&quot;&gt;Checkbox News&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/07/checkboxNewsFullSize.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did this around the time Boris Yeltsin died and the Virginia Tech massacre. I want to watch the news while I work, or tweet while I watch the news, basically &lt;i&gt;news isn't the only thing I'm doing. &lt;/i&gt;I want a bit of control over what flows through the video window. I got it, Yeltsin died. All the reports are starting to sound the same, so I uncheck it. No more news of Yeltsin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As media has progressed, we've learned that sometimes it's best to turn things on, and in other contexts that's too much work, I want others to do it for me, and then I need the ability to turn things off. TV news is most definitely in the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the flow that Twitter already has, if trusted news sources (a super important concept that should also be developed, not by Twitter) would add keywords to their video uploads, we could have Checkbox News running pretty quickly, maybe as early as next year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Introducing myself to Woodstock</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I just posted this to the private Woodstockers Say Anything group on Facebook. I've been living here since March, but mostly have been posting pictures and questions about what's going on here. This is the first time I've talked about what I do. I thought this was a good day to do it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't really introduced myself to the Woodstock group, today is a good day to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a software developer and one of the very first bloggers, starting back in 1994, on October 7.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;25 years ago today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These days I'm writing at my house in Woodstock.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am lucky that the work I do can be done anywhere there's a net connection. So I've moved around quite a bit in the last 25 years. I started writing on the web in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_California&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. In 2003 I moved to Cambridge, MA, then tried Seattle and the beach in northeast Florida (I had family there). I spent a few years in Berkeley, and then when my father died in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/03/fathersDay.html&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, I moved back to NYC (where I was born and raised) to be near my rapidly shrinking family. When my mom passed away in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/11/152545.html&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, I started looking for the next place, and this is where I landed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always felt that my software development was an artistic endeavor. My materials are unusual, they're almost all virtual. But I've built quite a castle out of all that imagination. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next software product I ship will come from Woodstock. And I'm celebrating 25 years of blogging right here in the woods, with the sound of rain and the smell of nature all around me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of my mottos of blogging is this --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Still diggin! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: My blog is at http://scripting.com/.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That would be the end of Trump. You can report on polls. You can report on FBI investigations of him. Or his trial with Trump U. Or that HRC calls for him not to get security briefings, all that's fair. But you can't report any Trump-generated news. If it came from him, it's trolling. If it's news about him that he didn't control, it's fair game.&quot; That's why the whistleblowers, witnesses and congressional committees are helping us win the battle with Trump. For the first time in a long time, Trump has lost control. We're in new territory.</description>

			<title>How I program</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this in a 2014 email to one of my former programming partners, Jake Savin, about how I develop today. I use the same tools five years later. It was a good design. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I program in the OPML Editor. I have a suite that makes it one button to deploy all the changed objects in my outline to public spaces on S3, ready to run. It's amazingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have debugging on the client but not the server. But I am radical about pushing functionality to the edge, and using the server just to make up for deficiencies in other APIs that prevent them from being called from the client. So it hasn't been that much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This environment is so primitive compared to Frontier, but everyone can use it, so that's why I work here. People think I've been incredibly productive, the truth is I've done all this stuff before, so it goes quickly the third or fourth time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why are we impeaching the president, big picture. Our system has gone off the rails, we've got a monarch in the White House. This impeachment is the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution&quot;&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and has the same goal as the first, to depose a king. And again, we have to change the rules so it won't happen again.</description>

			<description>An idea. If &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontpagelive.com/2019/10/05/impeachment-or-lost-election-what-if-trump-just-refuses-to-leave/&quot;&gt;Trump refuses to leave&lt;/a&gt; the White House, change its name to Federal Penitentiary #248, place guards at all doors, no one goes in or out. No Internet access, no food. The constitutional president governs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Guest_House&quot;&gt;Blair House&lt;/a&gt;. Trump comes out or dies there. Either way, eventually the White House is torn down, as a symbol of the imperial presidency. From now on the president &lt;i&gt;strictly&lt;/i&gt; follows the Constitution, no more undeclared wars, Congress appropriates the money. Impeachment hearings start immediately after the Inauguration, and at the first sign of the breach of the Constitution, the president is impeached and removed. It's not going to be a glamorous job in the future. We're getting rid of our second king, and we must make sure no usurper like Trump can turn the office of President into an authoritarian pulpit. Burning the White House to the ground serves as a symbol of that transition.</description>

			<description>Trump isn’t playing multidimensional chess, and neither is Putin. His goal was to reduce the US to chaos. Our elections are now meaningless. Mass killings by people with automatic weapons. No sense of normalcy. The news people are focused on impeachment, but since just after the 2016 election have buried the big story. The US has been defeated. We're occupied. We live in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_France&quot;&gt;Vichy&lt;/a&gt; America. The president is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17576956/transcript-putin-trump-russia-helsinki-press-conference&quot;&gt;Russian asset&lt;/a&gt;. It's all out in the open, but until the whistleblower, no one, not Mueller, not the Repubs in Congress, not the Dems in Congress, nor the Dems running for president, have had the guts to say the truth out loud. We all hope someone else will take the risk. We have to fight to get out of this. It's going to be bloody. But the longer we wait the worse it'll be.</description>
