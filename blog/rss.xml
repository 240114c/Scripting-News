You respond. &quot;The president confessed. Both in writing and verbally. Next question.&quot; Someone says go ahead impeach Trump, we'll have Pence, he's even worse, this is what you say. &quot;He couldn't win re-election as governor of Indiana, what makes you think he'd do so well in the 2020 election, assuming the Repubs even nominate him.&quot;</description>

			<description>I didn't know Heidi Hall who died of cancer at age 49 and wrote her own &lt;a href=&quot;https://religionnews.com/2019/09/26/finding-a-faith-that-is-stronger-than-death-or-my-familys-rejection/&quot;&gt;obituary&lt;/a&gt;. She tells a fantastic story, starting with the very first paragraph. &quot;My mother would be surprised that I did not die alone.&quot; Her story resonates with me. Families have all kinds of awful reasons for kicking members out. In her case it was that she didn't follow the family religion. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerryTeachout1/status/1178647762692427777&quot;&gt;Terry Teachout&lt;/a&gt; for the link.</description>

			<description>Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; was awesome (a word I chose deliberately). It has become the latest HBO megahit, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos&quot;&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones&quot;&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone is watching it. And just as &quot;winter is coming&quot; became a standard greeting when GoT ruled, we now say Fuck Off with the flair of Logan Roy. We got a taste last night of how well the kids learned from their father, and how they can work together when they are offended in the same way. I suspect they will all, together, be the successor that the show is titled for. But that's not a spoiler, because like you, I have no idea who the winner will be. Now fuck off. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Also watched the first episode of season 5 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affair_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Affair&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't expect it to be good, but someone I met at a Woodstock party recently told me it's the best season yet, so I checked it out, and wow, it is great. I'm going to try to savor this season, slowly, which should be easy given all the great political theater in the real world.</description>

			<title>The love of the Mets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched the last Mets game of the 2019 season yesterday. I guess  alot of people did, we wanted to see the rarest of things -- a Mets home run hitter. No Met had ever had the most home runs in MLB in a season, but Pete Alonso, a rookie pulled it off. He also set the record for most home runs in a season by a rookie. And he has a flair for public relations and is a natural born leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The game went into extra innings, and it looked for sure that the Mets would lose it after unbelievably bad relief pitching, which for the 2019 Mets is saying a lot. But in the bottom of the 11th, a miracle. With runners on first and second, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-dominic-smith-walk-off-home-run-atlanta-braves-20190929-now4zxifajf6zaja7al57ystau-story.html&quot;&gt;Dom Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who had been injured and hadn't come to the plate since July, hit a three-run home run for a dramatic and hugely spirited walk-off win. It's fitting that the Mets didn't make the playoffs this year, and also fitting that this lovely young team went out with such a flourish after it appeared the season would end in utter disappointment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've loved the Mets since 1962. It's a family tradition among the Winers and Kieslers. There's a new crew, rookies, a Cy Young winner and the certain Rookie of the Year. And an awkward but fun and loving group of misfits who somehow reach into your heart and give you a glimpse of their coming greatness. This is the cycle of the Mets. Can't wait for opening day in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dear Jack, first installment</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm proud that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Twitter, subscribes to my blog via email. I may start a regular column here entitled Dear Jack. Somehow I don't think he would mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one would recount a meeting I had with him, when Twitter was a small juggernaut, at a coffee place in downtown San Francisco. He told me of a plan he had for Twitter which, ever since, I was greedily anticipating. He wanted Twitter to be a general purpose storage system for user data. That was a long time ago, and Twitter is now a huge international resource without peer. I doubt if today's Twitter could contemplate such a feature, but how different today's world would be if the Twitter of the 00s could have pulled it off. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today's the day that all MLB games start at the same time, no matter where they're played. This was a good design call, imho -- in case there were still undetermined races, they can't be decided before your team's game starts.</description>

			<description>My friend who loves the &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2019/music/news/beatles-abbey-road-sneak-preview-50th-anniversary-edition-1203307482/&quot;&gt;new release&lt;/a&gt; of Abbey Road, which I have bought, insists that I'd for sure hear the difference if I listen on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07574TYWW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt;.

The songs are all so great, and form the musical sound track of my whole life all the way back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greatschools.org/new-york/queens/2125-Ps-32-State-Street/&quot;&gt;elementary school&lt;/a&gt;! As I said yesterday, and it bears repeating, that all the Beatles albums are deeply ingrained in who I am. All my early life experiences connected with every other period of my life. I started listening to the Beatles early in life and never stopped. But I only hear the Beatles, I only hear Abbey Road on the new mixes. It doesn't sound any different from other mixes. I wish it did, because I'd love to have more Beatles revelations at my age, which also has significance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCTunqv1Xt4&quot;&gt;in Beatles terms&lt;/a&gt;. Heh. But it sounds the same as it always did, full of wonder, like Abbey Road, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=beatles+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;music of my life&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I watched the Mets game last night, it was on Fox Sports, so the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/watch-gary-cohen-keith-hernandez-and-ron-darling-get-emotional-talking-about-1969-mets/308606600&quot;&gt;usual Mets telecasters&lt;/a&gt; were sidelined in favor of some total idiots whose names I don't want to know. They didn't bother with the play by play unless &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/09/29/mets-pete-alonso-completely-enjoyed-history-making-moment/&quot;&gt;Pete Alonso&lt;/a&gt; was up. At other times they interviewed Mets and Braves players from the dugout. They talked about how nice everyone is, at length. How Alonso must feel now, after hitting the home run, in great detail without any input from Pete, who was on the field at first base, crying. I wondered who likes this style of baseball. I saw him hit the 53rd home run, I was happy for him. But the actual news is that the Mets season is over. And the &lt;i&gt;bad news&lt;/i&gt; is that these idiots will be doing the broadcasts for much of the postseason baseball which starts next week. I know this isn't what's wrong with America, but it's a symptom of what's wrong. You're there to call the game, so STFU and do your job.</description>

			<description>So many people saying now that they knew what Trump was doing but no one listened. Anyone who was paying attention knew. The problem wasn't that no one listened, it was that no one wanted to do anything about it. We all wanted to get out of it with someone &lt;i&gt;else&lt;/i&gt; taking the risk. Mueller was supposed to be our savior, but he didn't want to risk it either. BTW, the thing that changed this time is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/trump-ukraine-whistleblower-is-cia-employee-worked-at-white-house.html&quot;&gt;the whistleblower&lt;/a&gt;, god bless them.

			<description>On the advice of a friend I got the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2019/music/reviews/beatles-review-abbey-road-anniversary-edition-box-set-1203350377/&quot;&gt;remastering&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road&quot;&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/a&gt;. I have been listening. Here's my reaction -- it sounds just like Abbey Road, which is so deeply ingrained in my being it might as well be part of my DNA. In other words I can't hear any difference. I hope whoever got the money ($10 for MP3s) does something good with it. ;-)</description>

			<description>Why no team can &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/09/27/nets-sign-former-knicks-forward-but-its-not-carmelo-anthony/&quot;&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2808625-windhorst-nba-executives-believe-carmelo-anthony-will-not-play-another-game&quot;&gt;Carmelo Anthony&lt;/a&gt;. Think about what kind of criticism the team would be open to if they did and the season went badly. The management and coaching would take a hit with fans beause they wasted their attention on giving an old player a stage to perform his last season. Kind of makes each game an exhibition, not a serious contest. Might sell a few more tickets, but maybe it'd have the opposite effect, the embarrassment of being Melo rubs off on the team. Even worse, what if they came close, and there's another forward they could have gotten that critics think might have made the difference. Meanwhile Melo was trading jersies with stars on other teams for photo ops. I feel for Melo. I wouldn't want to be where he is. He's more like a mascot than a player. He has a smell on him, and it's not a good one. I wish it weren't so.</description>

			<description>I can't understand is why more people haven't watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot; bojack+horseman&quot;+site%3ascripting.com&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bojack Horseman&lt;/a&gt;? It's on Netflix so it's pretty easy for a lot of people to get. I hear that people don't like animations. But it's one of the best shows ever, and stars some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398228/fullcredits?ref_=ttfc_ql_1&quot;&gt;best actors&lt;/a&gt;, and lots of cameos with real Hollywood stars. And many of the people who write and design the show go on to do other shows you probably love. It's very influential. I started spreading the gospel of Bojack in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/whyYouMustWatchBojackHorseman.html&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;. There's a new 1/2 season coming at the end of October. I can't wait.</description>

			<description>The idea of left and right is nuts, because Trump ran on a pretty far-left plan if you took his words at face value. I suspect the idea of left vs right is something that mostly makes sense to people who view politics as sport, like Mets vs Yankees.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nbariver&quot;&gt;@nbariver&lt;/a&gt; Twitter feed is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/15.html#a172245&quot;&gt;flowing&lt;/a&gt; again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm also getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/podc&quot;&gt;@podc&lt;/a&gt; Twitter feed going too. It started in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/10/04/myPodcatcherIsAPublishingT.html&quot;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, when podcasting and Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/10/04/myPodcatcherIsAPublishingT.html&quot;&gt;were&lt;/a&gt; both pretty new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html&quot;&gt;Rivers&lt;/a&gt; are like Twitter timelines except made out of RSS feeds, which are distributed all over the internet, not just on Twitter. So there's &quot;nbariver.com&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nbariver&quot;&gt;@nbariver&lt;/a&gt;. They carry the same information, in the same order (newest first) -- one on my server, and the other on Twitter. Similarly, there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;Podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/podc&quot;&gt;@podc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know this might be confusing, but it's worth understanding imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>This used to be easy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm returning my old Apple Watch for a $100 credit after getting a new 5th generation watch (I will write it up later). I've done this before and remember the process was easy because they designed the docs well, and took out all the unnecessary steps (something designers call factoring). But this time, instead of writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/27/watchDoc.png&quot;&gt;the instructions&lt;/a&gt; in a language I understand they use pictures with &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/ph19302&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/HT204568&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/HT210225&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of problems there. First, they use a very light color to print the URLs and they're too small for me to read, even with my glasses. I used my iPhone's flashlight, but the paper is glossy. I ended up taking a picture of the doc, and blowing it up. Second, couldn't they use a URL shortener? Didn't someone at Apple suggest that? I can't imagine it would cost that much. The whole thing, which I remember as being impressively easy last time is a pain in the ass this time. I think maybe the difference is that Steve is gone and most people who work at Apple started after he left. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The instructions also don't seem to say who you call or email to come pick up the watch. A phone number would be nice. It must be here, but for the life of me I can't see it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also there's this weird &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/27/redpaperthing.png&quot;&gt;red paper thing&lt;/a&gt; they included. I have no idea what it's for. It might be a piece of tape, but it isn't. There's no peel-off strip on the back. Mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; about the whistleblower is that it says that the US govt is still in there, it hasn't been dominated yet by the Nazis. Now that one whistleblower has emerged, hopefully there will be many more. A publication dedicated just to whistleblower coverage might be good.</description>

			<description>I was pissed that Schiff went ahead with the hearing, but then I wonder if his real audience is the dozen or so would-be whistleblowers who are dealing with a government that insists everything is privileged. He's saying to them, that's what they say about everything, you have to resist that. If necessary come to me, directly and we'll help.</description>

			<description>I don't see why the Dems went ahead with the public hearing today, given that the whistleblower report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/26/congress-releases-whistleblower-complaint-alleging-trump-abused-his-office-1514008&quot;&gt;came&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20190812_-_whistleblower_complaint_unclass.pdf&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; before the hearing. The hearing only made sense if the report was being withheld. We're not impeaching the acting DNI. This hearing only made sense of they were stonewalling. They're doing to the whistleblower what Barr did to the Muller Report. They need a showrunner, someone with an outsider's perspective. Schiff, Nadler, Pelosi are lost in the weeds. (Though unlike some, I thought Schiff's intro was brilliant.)</description>

			<description>It's funny how my subconscious &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/09/04/wordsISayToMyselfAsIProgram.html&quot;&gt;gets in the loop&lt;/a&gt; on my programming which is probably almost totally a higher-brain function. When I figure something out, here's what comes out of my mouth -- bang. That's a new one. It used to be bing and then ptahhh. Also thank you. Sometimes perfect. Then there was bingo bongo bingo. And now -- bang. Sometimes it's bang bang bang. There's no conscious thought behind these words. It's spontaneous. They just happen. It's as if my subconscious is watching, not entirely sure what's going on, like a black lab hanging out at my feet. He senses something has happened that's momentous and wants to participate. Verbally.</description>

			<description>Now the conversation has turned to what Trump should be impeached for. I don't know the public opinion answer, or the legal answer, or the right answer for Nancy Pelosi, but here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Occam%27s+News&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt; answer. He's running a corrupt enterprise from the White House. He's turned it into the Trump Organization, using all the powers of the presidency to cover up his crimes and fill his pockets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime&quot;&gt;Organized crime&lt;/a&gt;. To live the life he was living before he was elected but on a much grander scale. This violates everything in the Constitution, because it was the founders intent, in every instance, to have the United States be self-governing, not a monarchy.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I hit a pothole on a dirt road and I rolled over the handlebars. My instincts were good, I protected my head and neck, took the brunt on my ribcage and knee. It was a private place and a private experience. I laid there in the dirt for I have no idea how long, looked up at the sky through the trees, breathed, and was thankful it wasn't worse. Eventually I got myself up, dizzy, sat back down, breathed some more, righted myself and walked home. The bike wasn't rideable. I've rolled over handlebars once before, in Manhattan, in 2010, avoiding a collision with a car that was running a stop sign. That time I was in bed for days, this time it's not that bad. I'm already up and about. I love my bike, but today I feel betrayed. Not sure if it was really a hole in the road or a bike failure. I haven't had the will to look at the bike yet. I'm going to spend a day eating ibuprofen and being thankful.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/09/23.html#a150837&quot;&gt;briefly&lt;/a&gt; about new social graphs. Here's the background. For a long time, years, to get engagement with smart people on my writing, I had to cross-post to Twitter or Facebook, and at times Medium. This never worked well, there were limits to their APIs or format (character limits on Twitter, for example). Following the Cambridge Analytica mess, Facebook shut down their API so cross-posting was no longer possible. But now, Iâ€™m getting engagement, like I did in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;early years&lt;/a&gt;, on my blog, &lt;i&gt;without going through a silo. &lt;/i&gt;This conversation, the one weâ€™re having right now, is part of a new social graph. Nothing long-term about it, itâ€™s already here. Now the question is what's the next step. The email connection works. (To people who are only following in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, I recommend trying the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. It feels different. For example, if you reply, I will see it. That doesn't happen in RSS.)</description>
