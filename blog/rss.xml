			<description>We are at a terrible moment. Until Trump was impeached and the articles delivered to the Senate, there was always something more to do. But this is the end. Trump, post-acquittal, will be the monarch, in control of a hugely powerful military, economy and lest we forget it, the people who make up all this power, Americans. With new tricks the Chinese are working on, and no doubt Silicon Valley is as well, quietly, an American monarch will be all-powerful, able to reach into personal relationships in ways the Soviet Union couldn't dream of. If by some miracle the Senate votes to turn back, then we will have just barely dodged a bullet. But it seems more likely we're going straight into the fire without even trying to hit the brakes.</description>

			<description>A couple of worthwhile podcasts. Brian Lehrer's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/podcasts/767280204/impeachment-a-daily-podcast&quot;&gt;Impeachment podcast&lt;/a&gt; is the adult version of what you hear on cable news. It still focuses on process and horse races but it goes into more detail, Lehrer has a sharp mind, and is a great interviewer, so you learn more. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money&quot;&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;, always good, has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796799769/episode-964-billboards&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on privacy and billboards. I kept wanting to show them their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/10/09/655921710/chinas-social-credit-system&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; about social credit in China. No longer are the concerns about privacy theoretical and narrow. It's definitely coming to the US.</description>

			<description>I was corrected yesterday when I used the word exonerate in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1218629254507876354&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. People felt acquit was the correct term for what happens if Trump is absolved (heh another verb) by the Senate. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=acquit&quot;&gt;thesaurus&lt;/a&gt; thinks they're synonyms btw. Another verb would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anointing&quot;&gt;annointed&lt;/a&gt;, because no doubt a decree will follow from King Trump I (his new title, no sarcasm) requiring everyone to say nice things about him, or their charge cards won't work to buy groceries. See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System&quot;&gt;social credit&lt;/a&gt; an innovation of the Chinese.</description>

			<description>They're still arguing on Twitter about which word is correct. This is one of the saddest comments about what Americans were thinking about as our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire&quot;&gt;Reichstag&lt;/a&gt; was burning. Is the correct verb burning? I think enflamed was closer.</description>

			<description>How to defend against phishing. Stop and think if you’re granting access to your Google account, for example, and ask yourself how did I get here? If it wasn’t an operation you initiated, if you clicked on a link to get there, you probably don’t want to grant access.</description>

			<title>I'm re-thinking RSS now</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been having a big change of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/18.html#a153502&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; re RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, I compromised. I wanted journalism and blogging to share a common format. So I ditched the format I designed and accepted Netscape's adaptation in its place, to create unity. And it worked, it was the level playing field I had hoped for. Blogging and journalism both thrived in RSS. But at a price. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The price was forcing blogs into the same format that news orgs used. Problem is, as we can see clearly with Twitter, that format isn't the only one. As Twitter discovered, its style of writing doesn't fit into the model of RSS. People were disappointed when they stopped publishing tweets via RSS. But this was the right thing to do, in hindsight. It wasn't working.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I turned a corner &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; with my blog. I realized then, though I wouldn't have put it this way, the price I paid by merging formats with Netscape was too great. It forced blogging into the title-description-body model of journalism. But blog posts are more free-form, they don't all fit into that structure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now I'm thinking about what I could have done differently in 1999, if I had evolved my syndication format the way my blog wanted to go, not the way RSS pushed us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We need to do that again. We're staring at the next level. What if Trump succeeds at fully taking over the government? What if he's acquitted? What will that be like?</description>

			<description>Now that I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/17.html#a211547&quot;&gt;said it&lt;/a&gt;, RSS really is not a good way to read my blog.

			<description>People are cackling over the design of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/01/17/space-force-offers-first-peek-new-camouflage-uniform.html&quot;&gt;Space Force uniform&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>If I ask you to post something you wrote on Facebook on your blog, so I can point to it, it's because I thought you said something interesting, and I'd like to share it through my blog and feed, but I can't share Facebook posts outside of Facebook. I have a rule about that, and I rarely break the rule. Lots of reasons for it.</description>

			<description>I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jojo-rabbit&quot;&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, even though it got mixed reviews. You start out wondering what the hell they're doing, but in the end it's a good simple little story that has a lot of meaning. A sort of lite version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Handmaid's Tale&lt;/a&gt;. I really liked that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Wilson&quot;&gt;Rebel Wilson&lt;/a&gt; was in it, a good fit, as was the chief Gestapo guy, and Jojo's best friend. What's not to like?</description>

			<description>Neat new trick in my blog. When I generate links to titled posts, I put the title in the link, after the question mark in the URL. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/11/180743.html?title=naughtonOnFacebook&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;. The browser ignores it, as does the JavaScript code in the page. It's there to provide a human-readable title for the post. You might ask, why not just make the title the link? We did that, for many years, but then you couldn't change the title, or the URL would get out of sync with the title. It's more honest imho to just give each post a URL that is not a function of the title. But it's still nice to have the title present. So there you go, a neat solution and an honorable tradeoff.</description>

			<title>Bagels</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking as an authority on the subject of bagels, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/nyregion/bagel-ny-toasted-de-blasio.html&quot;&gt;toasted&lt;/a&gt; bagel. In fact unless I'm eating a freshly baked bagel, and that's pretty rare these days, I toast them. The warmth of toasting brings out some of the flavor of the bagel when it was fresh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However I cannot sanction whole wheat bagels. Why? Bagels are not hippie food. Sesame, onion, everything, these are my go-to flavors. The only thing worse than whole wheat is a cinnamon raisin breakfast bagel. Please. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My favorite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utopiabagelsofnewyork.com/menu&quot;&gt;bagel place&lt;/a&gt; is on Utopia Parkway in Whitestone, near where I grew up in Flushing. Neighborhood bagel stores are best. I've tried all the famous supposedly best bagels in NYC and imho they aren't bagels, they have more in common with loaves of bread. A bagel shouldn't be so large. Worst offender -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ess-a-bagel.com/&quot;&gt;Ess-A-Bagel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Give me a fresh bagel with cream cheese and lox and maybe a slice of cucumber and bit of onion, capers on the side, with a cup of fresh coffee and Uncle Davey is a happy camper. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If you shove the microphone into someone's face they don't have time to get nervous. Maps. I loved maps when I was a kid, and miss them terribly because of iPhones. Hillary's Emails and how the know-how of literally millions of people didn't influence journalism. Any one of these people could have helped, but journalism somehow didn't figure it out. Why can't universities do things? University is a 7-by-24 conference center. &lt;a href=&quot;#a152833&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;. Alex Jones and Shorenstein.

			<description>BTW no one or anything is going to &quot;awaken&quot; the Trump base. That's not how it works. When friends are in a bad marriage, one day you hear they're breaking up, you saw it coming but if you had tried to &quot;awaken&quot; them, they would have kicked your ass for butting in.</description>

			<description>I finished watching all three seasons of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Fargo TV series&lt;/a&gt;. I can't recommend it highly enough. I started to talk about it in the podcast coming out later today, but didn't finish the analogy. The hottest place in the US is always &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/weather-and-climate.htm&quot;&gt;Death Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Every day. So when they report the highest temperature on weather reports, they're telling you the place with the second highest temperature because it would just get boring to always say Death Valley. I think that may be how it works for TV series. Fargo is the best, hands down, nothing compares. It's incredibly funny the way Quentin Taratino movies are, or Itchy and Scratchy, it's filled with Easter eggs, and until you watch it twice (at least) you won't see the connections between the characters. For example, in Season 1, two of the main characters were also in Season 2, but it took place 25 years earlier. And there are echoes of the Fargo movie. So I often say The Wire is the best. What I really mean is it's second best. Fargo is, until further notice, the best thing on TV.</description>

			<description>Every once in a while I put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217803526564347904&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that gets forwarded a lot. This might be one of them. Trump has always reminded me of famous Jewish comedians. He borrows bits from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers&quot;&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217803526564347904&quot;&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt; reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, with his self-deprecating humor. He talks about his hair as being magnificent. Everyone in the room must realize his hair is bizarre and ugly. He'd look a lot better if he just got a normal haircut for a bald 73-year-old guy. What does he see when he looks in the mirror? Does he still see the young Donald, or does he see the old fool the rest of us see. Of course the press helps sell his buffoonery. It's our way of laughing at ourselves. Look what the great USA has been reduced to. We used to see ourselves as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam&quot;&gt;Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt;, now we look in the mirror and see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_the_Clown&quot;&gt;Bozo the Clown&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>With all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/sexist-myth-sanders-warren-female-president-spat.html&quot;&gt;michegas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2020/01/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-sexism.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; Bernie and Warren, here's what I think. My friends, they're both perfectly awful choices for president. Bernie is still living in the 60s. He has no ideas about the world as it exists today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217116064158560256&quot;&gt;Ask him&lt;/a&gt;. Second, Warren is a Harvard professor. She's not of the people. She's more comfortable in the faculty lunchroom, making snide jokes about the little people. They're both incredibly terrible choices to run the country starting in 2021. Neither will get done what they say they will, that will require team-building skills which neither have, and compromise, which means you have to listen. Even Obama, a relatively young person, was totally unprepared to deal with foreign hacking of our election. There's a reason Bernie doesn't have any apps on his phone. I bet he doesn't know what an app is or what the capabilities of mobile devices are. If he did, I think he'd be screaming about it in the special way Bernie screams. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you look at it as if you were hiring someone to put the country back together after the Trump combination heart attack, stroke, colon cancer, head-on car crash, you'd want someone who has gotten shit done. Who would see the problems we have now as interesting challenges. Would know who wants what in exchange for the things we need to do. Someone with a rolodex of effective people. Neither Warren or Sanders have the ability to do any of that. Elect them and at best you get a Jimmy Carter. I don't mean weak, the way the Repubs do, I mean having no idea how to get things done in Washington, and therefore proceeding to get nothing done.</description>

			<description>On Sunday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/12/155518.html?title=theImpentetrableShorenstein&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about the walls journalism puts up to keep the rest of us only speaking in the aggregate, to all our detriment imho. There are experts all over the place, who can provide fresh perspectives on the news, to engage people's minds, and set examples for creative approaches. I lamented that even though there is a former outstanding blogger running &lt;a href=&quot;https://shorensteincenter.org/&quot;&gt;Shorenstein&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading university think tanks for journalism, the walls remain, and we're no closer to fulfilling the opportunities created in the early web. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nicco-mele&quot;&gt;Nicco Mele&lt;/a&gt;, the blogger I was referring to, is no longer in charge of Shorenstein. I was so-advised by two former colleagues. I'm &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; out of the loop, that's for sure. Anyway, the new director is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nancy-gibbs?_ga=2.187920296.1420702108.1579015693-1352129629.1577806700&quot;&gt;Nancy Gibbs&lt;/a&gt;. Best of luck and please let me know if there's any way I can help. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you're working in Node.js and need to generate an RSS feed, you're welcome to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daverss&quot;&gt;the package&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for use in all my apps. Follow the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/rss/blob/master/examples/app/test.js&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea how it works. Just create two simple JavaScript objects, and call rss.buildRssFeed, and it creates a valid RSS 2.0 feed. It's really solid, burned in and tested in a wide variety of readers and aggregators. Variants of this code have been generating RSS feeds since (oy) 1999.</description>

			<description>I wonder if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/navigating-code-on-github#jumping-to-the-definition-of-a-function-or-method&quot;&gt;new features&lt;/a&gt; being added to GitHub allow you to point to a specific function, and have the link continue to work through new versions of the code? Something that I've always missed in GitHub.</description>
