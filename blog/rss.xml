			<description>Every once in a while I put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217803526564347904&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that gets forwarded a lot. This might be one of them. Trump has always reminded me of famous Jewish comedians. He borrows bits from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers&quot;&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217803526564347904&quot;&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt; reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, with his self-deprecating humor. He talks about his hair as being magnificent. Everyone in the room must realize his hair is bizarre and ugly. He'd look a lot better if he just got a normal haircut for a bald 73-year-old guy. What does he see when he looks in the mirror? Does he still see the young Donald, or does he see the old fool the rest of us see. Of course the press helps sell his buffoonery. It's our way of laughing at ourselves. Look what the great USA has been reduced to. We used to see ourselves as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam&quot;&gt;Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt;, now we look in the mirror and see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_the_Clown&quot;&gt;Bozo the Clown&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>One more thing for Doc re &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. If your outline is something you want to share with me and the other people listening to your podcasts, it's pretty easy. In the File menu choose &lt;i&gt;Get public link. &lt;/i&gt;It will &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/15/confirmDialog.png&quot;&gt;confirm&lt;/a&gt; that you want to make the outline public. Then a dialog will appear with a link to a page on instantoutliner.com. Copy that link, view it in the browser, send it to whoever you want to share it with. If you send it to me, I'll post it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Now any changes you make in your outline will be reflected immediately for everyone who's watching it.</description>

			<description>With all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/sexist-myth-sanders-warren-female-president-spat.html&quot;&gt;michegas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2020/01/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-sexism.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; Bernie and Warren, here's what I think. My friends, they're both perfectly awful choices for president. Bernie is still living in the 60s. He has no ideas about the world as it exists today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217116064158560256&quot;&gt;Ask him&lt;/a&gt;. Second, Warren is a Harvard professor. She's not of the people. She's more comfortable in the faculty lunchroom, making snide jokes about the little people. They're both incredibly terrible choices to run the country starting in 2021. Neither will get done what they say they will, that will require team-building skills which neither have, and compromise, which means you have to listen. Even Obama, a relatively young person, was totally unprepared to deal with foreign hacking of our election. There's a reason Bernie doesn't have any apps on his phone. I bet he doesn't know what an app is or what the capabilities of mobile devices are. If he did, I think he'd be screaming about it in the special way Bernie screams. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you look at it as if you were hiring someone to put the country back together after the Trump combination heart attack, stroke, colon cancer, head-on car crash, you'd want someone who has gotten shit done. Who would see the problems we have now as interesting challenges. Would know who wants what in exchange for the things we need to do. Someone with a rolodex of effective people. Neither Warren or Sanders have the ability to do any of that. Elect them and at best you get a Jimmy Carter. I don't mean weak, the way the Repubs do, I mean having no idea how to get things done in Washington, and therefore proceeding to get nothing done.</description>

			<description>On Sunday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/12/155518.html?title=theImpentetrableShorenstein&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about the walls journalism puts up to keep the rest of us only speaking in the aggregate, to all our detriment imho. There are experts all over the place, who can provide fresh perspectives on the news, to engage people's minds, and set examples for creative approaches. I lamented that even though there is a former outstanding blogger running &lt;a href=&quot;https://shorensteincenter.org/&quot;&gt;Shorenstein&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading university think tanks for journalism, the walls remain, and we're no closer to fulfilling the opportunities created in the early web. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nicco-mele&quot;&gt;Nicco Mele&lt;/a&gt;, the blogger I was referring to, is no longer in charge of Shorenstein. I was so-advised by two former colleagues. I'm &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; out of the loop, that's for sure. Anyway, the new director is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nancy-gibbs?_ga=2.187920296.1420702108.1579015693-1352129629.1577806700&quot;&gt;Nancy Gibbs&lt;/a&gt;. Best of luck and please let me know if there's any way I can help. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you're working in Node.js and need to generate an RSS feed, you're welcome to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daverss&quot;&gt;the package&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for use in all my apps. Follow the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/rss/blob/master/examples/app/test.js&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea how it works. Just create two simple JavaScript objects, and call rss.buildRssFeed, and it creates a valid RSS 2.0 feed. It's really solid, burned in and tested in a wide variety of readers and aggregators. Variants of this code have been generating RSS feeds since (oy) 1999.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/13/docToDave.m4a&quot;&gt;DocCast 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. This is an interesting medium because unlike other podcasts I've listened to Doc on, in this mode he gets to talk as long as he wants and can pause, and say whatever you want. Anyway I've decided I'm going to build a basketball court so when you visit we can meditate over shooting hoops. Anyway. Focus is the thing. Creating a groove. And making each other more powerful. That's going to be my next chapter. I do want to hear about your experience with Medium. We all have our own stories. I also want to tell you a story about Dave Bunnell. And why walking is the best.</description>

			<description>The next president should be creating a new social net for governance that involves all the voters who want to be involved. American citizens of voting age only. Doing real things to make America work better in every way, especially politically. I wrote this idea up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/21/theWhiteHouseWebsite.html&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; as Obama took office and didn't follow through on the promise (imho) of his campaign. Sanders is a nice guy for sure, but he can't do the organizing we need to do (see &lt;a href=&quot;#a180053&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;). It's not something you can delegate. I think Bloomberg may get this, but I'm not sure. The politicians running for office are still very old school, and Sanders is the oldest of them.</description>

			<description>I tuned in a bit of CNN and NBC yesterday, they were obsessing about the president's offhand claim/lie that he thought there were four embassies being targeted by the assassinated Iranian general. By now they should know Trump-speak. When he says he &quot;thinks&quot; something that means he made it up. What's the point in wasting so much time on it, when everyone with a mind understands exactly what he was saying.</description>

			<description>I'm having the best time writing my blog these days. What makes the difference? You. I play my blog the way a musician plays the piano or guitar. I can hear what I play, but I'm most interested in what you hear. I'm not running &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;McDonalds&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;, I've got a little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-mud-club-woodstock-2&quot;&gt;coffee shop&lt;/a&gt; in town. I serve the drinks, tell stories, decorate the place, choose the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; and lighting, bring in guests, all to pass the time in the most Dave-friendly way I can. I look for others doing their own things, so we can perform together. Our ideas influence, are tested and improved on. I'm back in the 90s and all of a sudden there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/01/13/ahugechunkofbluesky.html&quot;&gt;blue sky&lt;/a&gt; in every direction. All because, imho, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to be myself again. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Andrew Shell opens a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrewshell/status/1216370917225517056&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;, an iOS podcast client, asking why he was unable to subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out Overcast doesn't like titleless posts. I don't use Overcast myself, so I can't offer specific advice, but it is not acceptable to use the file name as a title. That's not what the file name is for. I described the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216404689719365634&quot;&gt;use-case&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet (of course without a title, tweets don't have titles).

She doesn't rattle. I think Trump should be followed by a woman, one the Repubs have yet had a chance to work on. I don't think Americans will stand for him abusing her.</description>

			<title>Journalists: We are not you</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On this day four years ago the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/12/0848.html&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; of bloggers wanting to replace reporters came up again. This was yet another colossal misunderstanding, much like the disconnect re Facebook today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We, bloggers, seem to always be trying to assuage journalists' fear of us. That really shoudn't be necessary, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sidebar: How refreshing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bensmith/iran-war-twitter&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt;, editor in chief at Buzzfeed News, refers to the &quot;the enduring positive qualities of social media.&quot; I wonder if his colleagues at Buzzfeed and other pubs tuned into that. How about a series of columns, updated to 2020 reality, that explore those positive qualities, to balance all the horror stories running in the NYT and elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I observe that journalists tend be blind when it comes to voters, users, writers, developers, anyone but politicians, rich people, and other journalists. We hardly exist as individuals, we're only considered in the aggregate (polls and the like). They shrink their world, furiously, so they can deal with it. Huge disconnects result. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This cartoon ran at the DNC in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html&quot;&gt;ISOJ&lt;/a&gt; in April last year, I described the above cartoon. I was one of the bloggers. Of course it hurt my feelings, it was intended to, although some people think it was done with irony. I personally don't buy that. YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bloggers don't usually wave their credentials in your face, so you might not be aware that many of us at the DNC in 2004 actually had decent credentials. For example, I had a good education from good schools. At the time I was a research fellow at Harvard. I had spent decades proving myself in my field and had risen to the top. I invented a bunch of technology that were in very wide use, and would form the foundation for all computer networking to come. I had been writing my blog for nine years at that point, and if I do say so myself, was a good writer. We were in the process of starting podcasting at the time. And I was just one of the DNC bloggers. The others were just as accomplished. You had to be someone special to be at the DNC in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A request for ambitious truth-seeking journalists -- stop writing from your fear, learn more about the world. Your blind spots are huge, and are killing us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The impentetrable Shorenstein</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Harvard, when I was a fellow there, one of the members of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/bloggroup/&quot;&gt;Berkman Thursday&lt;/a&gt; group was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_MacKinnon&quot;&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, who was a fellow at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorenstein_Center_on_Media,_Politics_and_Public_Policy&quot;&gt;Shorenstein Center&lt;/a&gt;, which was the rough equivalent of Berkman but for journalists. Previously she had been a CNN reporter from Beijing and Tokyo. Her fellowship was a turning point in her career. She went on to start &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalvoices.org/&quot;&gt;Global Voices&lt;/a&gt;, a blogging network, among other pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She got me together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a former NYT reporter, who was then the director of Shorenstein. To say he was blog-skeptical would be an understatement. He typified all the arrogance and fear of blogging in journalism, with what I saw as false confidence, bravado, I guessed, to try to keep me, and what I represented to him, at arm's length. We probably met just twice, maybe even once. I remember a contentious somewhat friendly conversation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.henriettastable.com/&quot;&gt;Henrietta's Table&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I personally asked Jones to come to the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;. He came. I watched him and joined in conversations with him at times. He appeared to be having the time of his life. And why shouldn't he? Here was a room full of sources, people who knew about something he was actually very interested in, and they didn't have to be coerced into talking about it. There was a ton of enthusiasm in the room. They were exploding with ideas, because of the huge potential of this space in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But after the BloggerCon we went back to our corners, staring at each other, unsure of how to communicate. By now &lt;a href=&quot;https://shorensteincenter.org/alex-jones-leave-shorenstein-center-july-1-2015/&quot;&gt;Jones has retired&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicco_Mele&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; is a former famous blogger, the guy who did the blogging at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_for_America&quot;&gt;Dean campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2004/02/07/howardDeanIsNotASoapBar.html&quot;&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, really breakthrough stuff, and yet nothing has changed. Shorenstein is still a bastion of professional journalism, and ideas from blogging don't penetrate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should all be working together. I said it then, keep pounding the table, beating the drum. No reason to stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have a bunch of things on my mind ready to go this morning, including the next in a series of &lt;i&gt;voicemailcasts&lt;/i&gt; with Doc Searls, a defense of XML when used as an object serializer, and the awful tendency of techies, esp those who work at Google, to have little respect for stuff that works, always wanting to reinvent without using their supposedly brilliant minds to evaluate their approach, and thereby burning decades of knowhow on a bonfire of geek vanity. Probably a few other things I'm not remembering at the moment.</description>

			<description>Okay first up is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10/daveToDoc.m4a&quot;&gt;26-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt; that follows Doc's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10.html#a145153&quot;&gt;kickoff&lt;/a&gt; of our nascent series. You will feel like you're eavesdropping on a conversation between two old friends, which is totally what it is. I remember the first time I met Doc, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck%27s_of_Woodside&quot;&gt;Buck's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant in Woodside, CA. I also remember very clearly the day in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/11/15.html&quot;&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; I was at his house in Redwood City, helping him get going with his Manila blog, he was one of the very first, and understood blogging in an instant. Doc looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilford_Brimley&quot;&gt;Wilford Brimley&lt;/a&gt;. He got the name Doc because he was a radio personality in North Carolina in the 1970s. He has a radio voice. In this voicemail I talk about Fargo, the masterful FX series. I just watched season 2 and am now working my way through season 3. I talk about my development process for the last decade or so. Very different from the previous 30 years. That's just the beginning. It's a content-rich podcast. Hope you listen and enjoy. Looking forward to Doc's rebut.</description>

			<description>It's a fact that XML can be used to serialize complex objects from all kinds of programming languages. I know this because I do it. Have been since 1998. So when a geek says on Twitter that you can't, he or she could get &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1215670988567916546&quot;&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; from me. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1215669583425617920&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; that illustrates. Further, XML and JSON are equivalents as object serializers. I know because I generate both &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; versions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216036119931969536&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for my blog. And as an experiment, my new XML-RPC implementation can use JSON encoding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc#using-json-in-place-of-xml&quot;&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, as an option. Of course there are not many servers that can understand this, so sticking with XML for now is the only practical option. I don't have any love for XML, but I do resent having to lose decades of progress for unrigorous technical thinking. I also don't like debating, anywhere, and especially not on Twitter. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A family story. My mother was a pure capitalist. She believed in hard work, being productive. She felt threatened by evidence of idleness. I drove her crazy. Even as a kid I would sometimes just sit in a chair in the living room of our apartment in Jackson Heights and think. Once she saw me sitting, lights off, no TV, no book, appearing to be doing nothing, and she lost her shit right there. Anyway, many years later, when I sold my company and then it went public, after years of begging me to get a job, her stock in the company was all of a sudden worth a lot of money. It was the only time I remember getting her unqualified approval. She boasted, even when I could hear, that I was profitable. In other words, the money and time she put into raising me made her money. &lt;span style=&quot;opacity: .5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I looked it up, and they are right. And through the rest of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/01.html&quot;&gt;January 2001&lt;/a&gt;, Adam and I were trying out neat hacks that could move large (for the day) audio and video files back and forth between our offices in California and Europe.

			<description>You want to know how bonded Doc and I are. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/11/15.html&quot;&gt;day in 1999&lt;/a&gt; when we got his blog started, I saw he had a blue box in his office. I asked what it is. He didn't really know. I took it home with me, I didn't even ask permission. I realized even at the time this was &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=cheeky&quot;&gt;nervy&lt;/a&gt; of me, but Doc was happy that I did. Turns out it was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_Qube&quot;&gt;Cobalt Qube&lt;/a&gt;, a revolutionary product, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/weLoveOurQube.html&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; that seemed like the future in 1999, but sadly its future has yet to arrive. Hopefully this decade it will. (On second thought maybe it was the precursor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;?)</description>

			<title>Naughton on Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://memex.naughtons.org/archives/2020/01/10/28373&quot;&gt;John Naughton wrote&lt;/a&gt; briefly about the difference between Facebook the company and Facebook the billion-user network. There aren't many people in journalism who see this dichotomy. He wrote to say he had a similar experience on the rail in the UK, viewing the backs of people's houses and wondering what their lives were like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I often do that when travelling by train in the UK in the dark, because British towns always turn their (unadorned, unguarded) backs to the railway while keeping their (brushed and spruced) fronts for the street or the road.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's hard for those of us who predate Facebook to not feel challenged by it and even to reject it. But it is what it is. The open web didn't organize the world, Facebook did. I wish it were otherwise, of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring Facebook as a technology base that we'll build on in the future, would be like refusing to listen to the Beatles in the 60s. You could do it, but if you were a musician or any kind of artist really, you'd be missing a common language that all your users understand. You'd be ignoring an important tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The real platform is the minds of all the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a book I read 30 years ago that opened my eyes to this -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Warfare-Military-Principles-Strategies/dp/0886840821&quot;&gt;Marketing Warfare&lt;/a&gt; by Ries and Trout. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People don't understand this &quot;battleground as the minds of the users&quot; idea is why people don't grok Bloomberg. He really gets it and has the resources to develop all this virgin territory that I'm sure he understands every bit as well as Trump or Murdoch. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Google's crawl-less index</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; asking for clarification of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10.html#a154129&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of yesterday's mini-posts about how Google can index the web without crawling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Doc said that Google and Bing are doing an increasingly bad job of archiving the history of the web. When he looks for something he wrote 20 years ago, the search engines can't reliably find it. He also said they're not indexing the current web like they used to. He experiences it thus: Google can't find one of his recent posts, but then after he visits it, presumably in Chrome, it can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From this I conclude:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Google isn't crawling his site. In the past it would check frequently updated pages, such as blogs, every few minutes, for new links. On discovering one, it would read it, add it to their index, and then it would be findable in Google. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But when he visits one of those pages in Chrome, then, a few minutes later it can be found in the search engine. It appears to be using Doc's human behavior to find new pages to index. They can do this now because they have a popular web browser, so they can retire their old method of discovering links and let the users do their crawling. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My own experience. For what it's worth, I've found that Google is still really good at finding my old stuff, as long as there are some good unique words I can search for. If I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22future-safe+archives%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22future-safe+archives%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.9495j0j3&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;future-safe archives&quot; for example, it gives me back a really good set of results. But the other day I was trying to find something I wrote about Obama and his online social net he let dwindle after the 2008 election, and although I believe I wrote about this a number of times, I could only find one piece, by going to the January 2009 archive page and scanning it with my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Caveat: This is all based on tea-leave reading. Neither of us have any insight into what Google is actually doing to maintain its index. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been wanting to bootstrap a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10/docSearlsFutureSafeArchives.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt; for the longest time. When we get together, our conversations are fluid, and full of ideas and stories. In the last few years we've started to exchange voicemails using the iPhone voice memo app. A few days ago I said to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Doc+Searls%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/a&gt;, in a voicemail of course, that we should try to do a podcast that was just a series of voicemails. Nothing more fancy than that. So here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/01/10/docSearlsFutureSafeArchives.m4a&quot;&gt;Doc's first podcast&lt;/a&gt;, to kick things off. He talks about what I call &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+future-safe+archives&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;future-safe archives&lt;/a&gt;. Ideas follow. I think we should &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/151513.html#a153528&quot;&gt;retire domains&lt;/a&gt; the way sports teams retire numbers. We should have a plan for how to preserve the web, not a photograph of the web (that's what archive.org does). BTW, since this podcast is part of scripting.com, it is backed up every night. The original is on Amazon S3, which I think it is the most stable and affordable publicly available storage system. If it didn't exist, I'd be begging them to create it.</description>

			<description>An interesting idea in Doc's &lt;i&gt;voicemailcast, &lt;/i&gt;apparently Google doesn't crawl the web these days, they use the addresses of pages that Chrome users visit. Makes total sense. It's why his pages don't show up in Google search until he goes there. Hadn't thought of this.</description>

			<title>Facebook is not bad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; distribution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; is that I hear directly from readers. Most of the responses are thoughtful and informative, and that's great. But sometimes I receive responses that are neither thoughtful or informative, like the one I received yesterday (author's name withheld so it isn't personal), quoted below.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Just because a billion people do something doesn’t mean the thing they do is good.  Two examples:  smoking tobacco and dumping CO2 into the atmosphere. Facebook use is undercutting democracy around the world.  It’s not getting better.  We need something like Wikipedia but in the Facebook arena.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, this was not written by a journalist, but it could have been. It's more or less the party line among journalists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second, I am a former smoker, and it was definitely damaging my health, a cardiologist who had just operated on my heart said so. I stopped, and believe I am healthier as a result. I am still alive, and that's something. But I have to say there were positive things about smoking. I won't go into them here and now, I just want to say that they exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Third, the correspondent is indulging in a logical falacy. It's true some popular things are bad, but that doesn't mean all popular things are bad, nor are all bad things bad in all ways. His second example &quot;dumping CO2 into the atmosphere&quot; is bad, but driving cars is often good. An ambulance that saves someone's life is dumping CO2 into the atmosphere. Later today I'm going to drive to get groceries. That's good. I use electricity to heat my house. On a cold night, where the temperature can go down into the teens, believe me &lt;i&gt;that's good. &lt;/i&gt;And to get the heat I am dumping CO2 into the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As someone who uses Facebook, let me testify that many of the things that happen there are good, unique, empowering and fun -- things I wouldn't want to live without. These things are certainly worth &lt;i&gt;understanding&lt;/i&gt; before dismissing the whole medium. You can learn from something you don't like. A billion people doing something raises the question &quot;What are they doing?&quot; We should aspire to not dismiss before understanding, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A little unsolicited advice. Don't be so rigid. If someone you respect says something is worth doing, if you dismiss it with a generalization you can't prove, you're missing something, and probably not just in this area. Living a creative and interesting life imho requires considering possibilities you might have rejected without much consideration, stepping outside your comfort zone. Keep an open mind. Challenge your assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays when you go to a baseball game there is never a moment when the PA system shuts up so you can talk about the game with your friends. This used to be one of the nicest things about going to a live game. The shared experience. Now they play commercials every minute that baseball isn't being played. On top of the $100 you paid for the seat. We are coerced into singing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMdkcTmPS2U&quot;&gt;God Bless America&lt;/a&gt;, a truly awful song, instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4-gsdLSSQ0&quot;&gt;Take Me Out To the Ballgame&lt;/a&gt;, as a form of weak patriotism (weak because if they understood America, they'd realize that forcing people to pray to your god is about as un-American as it gets). We have to rise to thank the troops who protect our freedom in Afghanistan, even if you don't believe that's what's going on. That's the world that Facebook exists in. So if you don't like the commercialism of Facebook, the lies that advertisers tell, you should have the same feeling about America's national pastime. And Facebook isn't nearly that bad, btw. And some very good things happen there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Let me tell you a little story. When I was 14, I went to high school in the Bronx and lived in Queens. It was a 1.5 hour trip each way. I had a few choices but they all magically took the same amount of time. One of the routes was to take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+St,+Flushing,+NY+11358/Main+St+%26+Roosevelt+Avenue,+Queens,+Queens+County,+NY/@40.7655943,-73.8268099,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a80780e9c3b:0xa8668e9b256999a4!2m2!1d-73.794882!2d40.769637!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c26011d8a8638d:0x3a7a296f0fbc67fc!2m2!1d-73.8301324!2d40.7595662!3e3&quot;&gt;Q16 bus to Main Street&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Main+St+%26+Roosevelt+Avenue,+Queens,+Queens+County,+NY/Grand+Central+Terminal,+East+42nd+Street,+New+York,+NY/@40.7522944,-73.9738374,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c26011d8a8638d:0x3a7a296f0fbc67fc!2m2!1d-73.8301324!2d40.7595662!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a21fb011c85:0x37513b7f1821408b!2m2!1d-73.9772294!2d40.7527262!3e3&quot;&gt;7 train to Grand Central&lt;/a&gt;, and switch to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Grand+Central+Terminal,+East+42nd+Street,+New+York,+NY/The+Bronx+High+School+of+Science,+West+205th+Street,+The+Bronx,+NY/@40.8192919,-73.9978298,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a21fb011c85:0x37513b7f1821408b!2m2!1d-73.9772294!2d40.7527262!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f39fba19f047:0x456fa7ab9f9bae18!2m2!1d-73.890843!2d40.8783054!3e3&quot;&gt;4 train uptown&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Park_Boulevard%E2%80%93Lehman_College_station&quot;&gt;Bedford Park Blvd station&lt;/a&gt; is two blocks from the school. One day on the train, I remember this really clearly, I was watching all the houses and apartment buildings we passed, first in Queens, then in the Bronx. Inside every window, I guessed, was a family, like my own, possibly. With their dramas and struggles, stories, victories, history, abuse, happiness, fear. I tried to imagine how each of them might live and realized in an overwhelming way that I could never begin to understand who they were. NYC, even then, was an ethnically and economically diverse place. Of course as we traveled through the city, the people on the train changed too. Very few of them were Bronx Science students. There were all kinds of people. Who knew what any of them were thinking. The point is this. The world is huge. To keep our sanity we have to simplify it, and to do that we have to ignore differences. The stories we tell ourselves little connection to reality. And so any general statement about a community as huge and diverse as Facebook is certain to miss the mark, widely. And most of what we read only focuses on the company, not the users. To have that appear as journalism is just wrong because journalism has a higher calling, to find out what's real, what's true, and then say that.</description>

			<title>Candidate Bloomberg</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of pieces just floated through my river. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/michael-bloomberg-president-democrats-beat-trump.html&quot;&gt;Nominating Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; for President Isn’t a Crazy Idea &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1215301568972632070&quot;&gt;Biden, Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; have largest leads against Trump in Michigan poll&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Amazing. And Bloomberg is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What people (mostly journos) overlook with Bloomberg is that he has mastered two very important things for a presidential candidate:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Media&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tech&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think about who he is and how he thinks and how he made his fortune. A presidential campaign is not that different from his news org. In a way it's as if Steve Jobs didn't die, left Apple again, was mayor of NYC for 12 years, took some time off, made some more money and then decided to run for president. Bloomberg has mastered media and tech as much as Jobs ever did. Very different styles, but similar levels of accomplishment. Do not underestimate Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nominating Bloomberg is not a crazy idea. He's a good fit for the country. A nice rebound from Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
