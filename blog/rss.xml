And they found Trump's programming running his mind. Don't miss this point. Now getting attacked by Trump, in his rallies and tweets, has a new measurable cost, one it didn't have before this week. We used to think (hope) his rallies and tweets were harmless. Now we know they are not.</description>

			<description>I read a post this morning by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1055890611105087493&quot;&gt;Evan McMullen&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative Republican saying &quot;the next political tribe in America will care about everyone.&quot; I commented &quot;sign me up.&quot; Then someone &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bob2cleo/status/1055890152256618497&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;That's the Democrats.&quot; And I thought &quot;That's bullshit.&quot; You want to keep losing elections, keep demonizing white men. There's a lot of resentment building, the Repubs have figured out how to tap into it. On the other hand McMullen's theoretical party, by design, will care about everyone.</description>

			<description>If Trump were a regular citizen would the Secret Service arrest him for inciting violence against Democrats and journalists? Is he criminally liable for what his acolytes do at his behest? (BTW, Bernie never told anyone to attack Steve Scalise so that's bullshit.)</description>

			<description>There is a reason for young healthy people to buy insurance even though there is no longer a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/365185-final-gop-tax-bill-repeals-obamacare-mandate&quot;&gt;requirement&lt;/a&gt; that you do so. Pre-existing conditions. You probably don't have any when you're young, so you can get insurance. They can't cut you off if you get one if you were previously covered (it would be something if they could, you could get cut off as soon as you need insurance). So starting and maintaining continuous coverage, even if you get insurance through a job, is a &lt;b&gt;good&lt;/b&gt; idea. You never know when you might become a person with a P.E.C.</description>

It was a transitional day, as the day after this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/11/07.html&quot;&gt;Election Day&lt;/a&gt; will &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; be, one way or the other.</description>

			<description>I was thanked via email yesterday for my political posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. A funny thing for sure, because I was not aware that my blog posts appear there. I guess Manton must have hooked up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feed to my account on his site. Or maybe I did it and forgot? Either way, it's good, the more people who can hear me the better. The magic of open formats and protocols at work.</description>

			<description>If a few thousand poor people from Central America &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/24/caravan-migrants-what-is-it-where-from-guatemala-honduras-immigrants-mexico&quot;&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; to the US over 1200 miles away can threaten the well-being of our country, why are we spending $600 billion a year on defense? (The answer is they are no threat. We are set up to process them. That's why we spend so much on borders. We could look this shit up before we accept the premise of Republican hype. Jerry Brown should run for president just to get the Dems back on track hype wise. This stuff is simple, but the current Dem leadership is as Trump says weak.)</description>

			<description>I went for a haircut today at a Russian barber shop here in NYC. They had Fox News on, which is unusual, they usually have Turner Classic Movies (one of the reasons I like the place). So Fox News was going on endlessly talking about the bombs. There was very little news, not much to say. I'm totally tuning into this these days. It's all very repetitive. Like the commenters are instruments in an orchestra who can be relied on to play certain notes when called on. The moderator, Wolf or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/24/cnnOnTheStreet.png&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; or Jake or Brett or whoever is the conductor of the orchestra. He's following a script that's whispered in his ear by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_News_(film)&quot;&gt;Holly Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Mindless crap that's been focus group tested to the max. Blah and blah oh and btw blah, blah. Polls. When is it ok to politicize. No it's too soon for sure. Stay tuned there's much more breaking news to come.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/024939.html&quot;&gt;mom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/11/152545.html&quot;&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; 5 this year. Since then sheâ€™s been alive in my dreams. But now in late October my dreams have caught up. My subconscious has received the news. Iâ€™m dreaming the realization that Iâ€™ll never see her again. The feeling is of course deeper than the conscious realization. It was a shock, tinged with sadness, remorse and regret, but also a feeling of freedom, the likes of which I've never felt before.</description>

			<description>This Neil deGrasse Tyson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SXHMm5I-68&quot;&gt;segment&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution of the eye helped me understand something important about evolution. &quot;We like to think of our eyes as state of the art, but 375 million years later, we still can't see things right in front of our noses, or discern fine details in near-darkness the way fish can. When we left the water why didn't nature just start over again and evolve us a new set of eyes that were optimal for seeing in the air? Nature doesn't work that way. Evolution reshapes existing structures over generations, adapting them with small changes. It can't just go back to the drawing board and start from scratch.&quot;</description>

			<description>It's been a week since we started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/96&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about discovery in blogs. We haven't discussed much, as far as I can see, that hasn't already been tried. One idea, one-click to subscribe to a blog's feed was something we did &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/22/141111.html&quot;&gt;at UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. The problem wasn't technology, it wasn't hard, rather it was how to get enough of the blogging tools to support the same calls to form critical mass. It didn't happen. Here's my conclusion on the discussion so far. Two things are needed to upgrade the blogosphere. 1. A growing excited user base. 2. A (somewhat) dominant vendor who is committed to user choice, and therefore uses open clonable formats and protocols. #1 is a prerequisite for anything to happen imho. #2 is a lesson I learned when the clonability of UserLand's products was not reciprocated by our competitors. That's an important lesson and I don't think many others are aware of it. As with our tech, it's available to anyone who wants it.</description>

			<description>I just ordered an iMac Pro. The only upgrade I got was doubling the memory to 64GB. I usually buy as little Apple memory as possible, but I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/imac-pro-review-not-a-consumer-machine-but-not-quite-perfect-for-pros-either/3/#h1&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that installing memory on this machine is not so easy. So I paid the luxury tax. The &lt;i&gt;whole thing&lt;/i&gt; is a luxury, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/22/currentMac.png&quot;&gt;current iMac&lt;/a&gt; performs pretty well. I use it as a writing machine, blogging and software, and I guess it's mostly doing I/O, it's not compute-bound. But this is the last moment for me to buy a new Mac, this is the last O/S release that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/98&quot;&gt;runs Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. There's no direct port planned as far as I know. And hopefully before this machine dies, there will be a Linux port, which is where I'd rather be spending my time. Or possibly my JavaScript codebase will be rich enough so I can port my dev tools to be independent of Frontier. Not my preferred path forward. I've been using a Mac since 1984, with a brief hiatus at the end of the 90s. The total with tax and AppleCare came to $6,497.66. It will be delivered between November 6 and 8. Just in time to either celebrate victory in the election or drown my sorrows in defeat.</description>

			<title>Radio UserLand's coffee mug</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, I reconstructed the Radio UserLand coffee mug icon in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1:5335/system/pages/subscriptions?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot; title=&quot;Click on the XML coffee mug to subscribe to &amp;quot;Scripting News&amp;quot; in Radio UserLand.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/22/coffeeMugIcon.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;36&quot; height=&quot;36&quot; alt=&quot;Subscribe to &amp;quot;Dave's Handsome Radio Blog!&amp;quot; in Radio UserLand.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The icon appeared on every Radio blog, and Manila site, and on the Scripting News home page. At the time that was a lot of support believe it or not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you click the icon it sends a message to the server running on port 5335 of the local machine, which was Radio UserLand, telling it to subscribe to the URL for Scripting News' RSS feed. The app would come to the front, confirm that you want to subscribe, and if so it would add the feed to the database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It could have worked for any feed on any blog. It was our hope that it would catch on, but that wasn't the mood of the time. People wanted to blaze their own trail. And it probably should have moved to a centralized publicly owned resource, the commons (like DNS perhaps). But it wasn't meant to be, it didn't happen, and easy subscription became a feature-advantage of the silos over open blogging. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If we were keeping a list of criteria for what makes a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+future-safe+archive&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;future-safe archive&lt;/a&gt;, GitHub, now owned by Microsoft, would be far ahead of Amazon S3, because public repos are free of charge, therefore even if you were to stop paying the bill, only your private repos would disappear. It would be even better if there were a way to buy say 100 years of service in advance. And the fact that GIT is so good at synchronization (it's what it was built for originally) is a great feature for a FSA. You could insure your insurance.</description>

			<description>I wish there was a Busy Developer's Guide to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe there is? I am an experienced web CMS developer. I have implemented lots of frameworks. I'd love to see a concise how-it-works doc, with good examples. For example, I'd love to see a repo containing a Jekyll website that I can poke around in to see how the pieces fit together. It's one thing to read about it, the fastest way to learn is to see it in action. I'd also love to see a quick spec for what a Jekyll theme is.</description>

			<description>Terry Heaton sent a note yesterday reminding me that the original BloggerCon was held in October 2003, in other words, exactly 15 years ago this month. We missed the actual days, which I can infer from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/10.html&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; was October &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/04.html&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/10/05.html&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately the first archive.org &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040818060437/http://www.bloggercon.org:80/&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of the BloggerCon home page was in 2004, when were getting ready for BloggerCon III at Stanford. I'm going to keep looking on my servers and backups for data about the first BloggerCon. I'm going to archive that as I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://history.userland.com/&quot;&gt;archiving&lt;/a&gt; the old userland.com websites last month.</description>

			<description>I switched away from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2018/10/17/knicks-put-on-a-show-and-open-season-with-hawks-destruction/&quot;&gt;Knicks&lt;/a&gt; season opener to watch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/25011260/fan-interferes-attempt-boston-red-sox-mookie-betts-catch-ball&quot;&gt;ALCS playoffs&lt;/a&gt; for a few minutes. When I came back the Knicks had set a record for the most points in a 2nd quarter by any Knicks team. Yes the Hawks suck. But still.. Could this Knicks team be a winner? Failing that could they at least be fun? It's been so long, 2012 to be specific, since the Knicks were fun to be a fan of. Meanwhile over in Houston, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texas-sports-nation/rockets/article/3-pointers-Takeaways-from-the-Rockets-loss-to-13316609.php&quot;&gt;Rockets&lt;/a&gt; have the Curse of Carmelo. I feel sorry for the old man. I really do. He was the heart of the Knicks for so long. Hate to see him become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_(sports)&quot;&gt;journeyman&lt;/a&gt;, the way he made &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/12/19/whatIfTheKnicksHadKeptJeremyLin.html&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt; leave home. I guess &lt;i&gt;what goes around comes around&lt;/i&gt; applies. Funny coincidence, Lin, who now comes off the bench for the Hawks, played in last night's game at the Garden. He was a bit rusty at first, but the old magic is still there, you can see it.</description>

			<description>In Battlestar Galactica, the humans call the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_(Battlestar_Galactica)&quot;&gt;Cylons&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toaster&quot;&gt;toasters&lt;/a&gt;, to remind them they are machines not people. But we know theyâ€™re actors, and the actors are actual people, pretending to be machines that look human. It creates an interesting conflict that they explore from every angle.</description>

			<title>Humans aren't really toxic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been wanting to discuss the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=toxic+masculinity&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;male toxicity&lt;/a&gt;. What does it mean? And why only male toxicity? Why aren't women given the same awful label? It's like the use of the word &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt; to apply to things that were never alive. Seems like a misuse of the term, an impossibility. I saw one person &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rickhood/status/1052521774653558784&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina was a toxic male, without explaining how or why or what it means. We're just supposed to know? I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052524370302779392&quot;&gt;don't&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I engaged on Twitter with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/foosel&quot;&gt;Gina HÃ¤uÃŸge&lt;/a&gt; who used the term in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/foosel/status/1052477246634696705&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about a series of lovely old LEGO ads, one which &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/17/legoad.png&quot;&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; a girl and her LEGO creation. As a tech creative person myself, I am so proud of that little girl for following her path to geekosity. The smile on her face tells the story. Whatever this is, it's mine. That's the geek ethos imho. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think we should stop applying a word like toxic to people. It's not far from calling people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maryanngeorgantopoulos/trump-immigrants-vermin-infest&quot;&gt;vermin&lt;/a&gt;. It's dehumanizing. A prerequisite for violence. Find another way to say what you're trying to say or refine it so it's closer to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I don't think there's any way to measure the quantity of abuse one gender does to the other. It's all a soup -- we create each other. I inherited toxicity from both of my parents, and they from theirs, male and female, all the way back. We create each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We may not achieve some ideal we have for each other. A lot of our grievances come from that. I watch people online who are so good at finding fault in others, but never see the obvious opportunities &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; have to solve the problems themselves. If you regret other people aren't working together, the best approach is to start working with other people yourself. Take the advice you so want to give to others to your own heart, and then act on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This isn't new wisdom. Humans spend their whole lives figuring this out. It's why functional families are so nurturing, if we could only find one! Accept what we have and do your part to make the present and future better. That's about as good as it gets imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had to see a specialist doctor today. At 63 my doctors are all younger than me. This one was so bright, careful in explaining and listening, enthusiastic about good health, an evangelist. Just 31 years old. Made me feel so optimistic about the future.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052224515932073990&quot;&gt;weird idea&lt;/a&gt; I proposed to one of my favorite political analysts. Why can't journalism raise issues? They don't have to let politicians drive this. Don't the voters have issues that need airing? What about the people who wrote the Constitution who expected Congress to act as a check on the Executive branch? Why do we have to sit on the sidelines and accept the crap they hand us. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1052317163778990081&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; is doing it. Jeez. You'd think they wrote off the intellect and seriousness of the electorate. Time to change the way we do things. Journalism could be where the change starts. Of course they would have to listen, for a new idea to penetrate. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I want a new kind of news where there are no professionals. Only user-generated ideas. No blame discussed. No live debates. Only ideas for how to solve the obvious problems, and then we write the Occamâ€™s version of the story.</description>

			<title>My agenda for the midterms</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I scattered $25 contributions all around &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/senate2018/&quot;&gt;the country&lt;/a&gt; for Senate races, so of course now I'm getting calls and spam from Dems wanting more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they're willing to call me, with a real human being (it seems) why not send an email written by a human being, asking if I have anything I want to contribute that might not be money?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Someday political parties will do more than advertise, they will gather the best ideas from the people and implement them. A different kind of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Right now I'd tell the Dems to talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/16/oversight.png&quot;&gt;oversight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Restoring power to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that means voting out the Repubs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to hear some promises from Dems that they plan to provide the missing oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why didnâ€™t Elizabeth Warren hold on to the results of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/181015/p5#a181015p5&quot;&gt;her study&lt;/a&gt; until Trump raised the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/07/05/trump_offers_1_million_for_pocahontas_elizabeth_warren_to_take_dna_test.html&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; again? Raising it herself just before the midterms seems like the most disadvantageous timing. Imagine if Trump re-stated his offer of $1 million, then she could release the study. Bonk. Wasted opportunity?</description>
