			<title>We need Facebook to interop</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Listening to Zuckerberg speak yesterday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, broadcast on Facebook (good move)..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He talks about &quot;data portability&quot; -- that isn't what's needed, that's easy and no one uses it. It doesn't do anything to reduce lock-in. Useless.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's needed is choice. And for that you need interop. Also easy. We have standards for that, which FB ignores. If they did it, then users would have choice. That's the old thing that tech czars like Zuck, Gates, Jobs etc won't give their users.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I guess he gets away with this because reporters don't insist on understanding how his ideas would work. He says just enough that's true to make you think the other stuff is true too. Slippery.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I mean by interop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, by interop -- it could be really simple. Just four things. They've already done a big part of one of the things on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html&quot;&gt;prior checklist&lt;/a&gt;, so I added another item. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Support the HTML &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp&quot;&gt;anchor element&lt;/a&gt; in posts, so I can link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg&quot;&gt;other places&lt;/a&gt; on the web from my writing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Titles for posts. Like the &amp;lt;title&gt; element in the &amp;lt;head&gt; section of an HTML document. To interop with other content systems, FB must have the concept of a post title.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Enclosures. Since podcasting has become such a big thing, FB should be compatible with the web and support this feature. It's so important, and really simple.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; in and out. This is the new item, now that they have simple styling in Facebook posts (bravo! were they listening?). With this, other blogging systems could fully peer with Facebook. People would have choice. It wouldn't cost FB anything to do this, they already are so dominant. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Facebook did all this, and I think they probably already have code to do most of it, they could make moderation a problem for the web, not just for them. It would get them out of the hot seat. It would a brilliant move, and also the right way to feed the web, which they used to build Facebook itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Debate review</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched the first fifteen minutes of the debate. I thought Warren's opening answer was very good. She's learned how to bring the listener into her story. Too many politicians don't find a way to get people to think about themselves. That's key. Because people are always thinking about themselves. Once you get them to feel you're over there on their side, your ideas start clicking with them. They'll think you think like they do. They start to like you. And they start to listen. That's everything. I have to say that was the first time I could say that about Warren. Clearly she wants to win, that's also a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then it became clear it was just going to be canned speeches all night, I started nodding off and went back to reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall/dp/0394720245&quot;&gt;The Power Broker&lt;/a&gt;. I'm starting to get to the good part, the downfall of Moses. He really fucked NY. They should make a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt;-like show about the life of Robert Moses. Get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_McRaney&quot;&gt;guy&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/27/hearstDeadwood.png&quot;&gt;played&lt;/a&gt; Hearst to play Moses.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Maybe the city should offer the Nets use of Madison Square Garden until the Knicks get it together. Maybe we could even call the Nets the Knicks, why not, it's not as if the actual Knicks are doing anything with the name. Let Brooklyn have Dolan.</description>

			<title>A serial radio play</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/24.html#a213149&quot;&gt;last night's show&lt;/a&gt; starring John Lithgow as Trump. It was sold as a play. I thought that meant it was going to be dialog between characters, pure story-telling creating suspension of disbelief, but it was just another reading of the Mueller report, a good one. I would have thought that great actors would want to do a play, but it wasn't a play. It was actors reading a report written by lawyers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post I'll outline how the project, if it were to really have impact, would get started. It will be more of a commitment than last night's performance. But our world is worth it, don't you think??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the concept... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A serial radio play, distributed as a weekly podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Opening scene, a congressional hearing. A select committee of senators and representatives question (actors playing) Manafort, Flynn, Hicks, Comey, etc, who answer questions fully as they did for Mueller. The answers derive from the report, but they are not verbatim. The actors strive to present their characters in a good light. The congresspeople are all interested in getting the truth. Even the Repubs. This part of course is fiction. Artistic license. And the Democrats have the guts to ask probing, hard questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dramatic interludes in the Oval Office, on Air Force One, golf courses and watching TV (executive time) where the president, played by Lithgow (an excellent choice to play Trump) gives soliloquies in the form of phone conversations with various celebs such as Hannity, Carl Icahn and a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarch&quot;&gt;surprises&lt;/a&gt;. We keep coming back to the hearing room, that's where the story is really being told. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The resulting radio show, a riveting drama, is released one episode a week as a podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Perfect person to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG0ch202prY&quot;&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKdSGSZfbnA&quot;&gt;imho&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQJ6yqQRAQs&quot;&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOSxwFtBNww&quot;&gt;Sorkin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I have no idea where they're going, but based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-returned&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;, it looks good. Avoiding spoilers, thanks.</description>

			<description>Overnight I learned of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/mueller-report-graphic-novel-idw-shannon-wheeler_n_5d0d3de7e4b07ae90d9d0009?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL0pvdXJuYWxpc20vY29tbWVudHMvYzRqbDJrL2NvbWljX3B1Ymxpc2hlcl90dXJuaW5nX211ZWxsZXJfcmVwb3J0X2ludG8v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMwLdeqGv6OQnYRAMW60Mh2b9lJn0FLPr-ZCcImuoXDccEUuSRmB3Y2fYkznyZVAsG-kNwvNv4lfOrhEZ7FSV39SI-0o8sSqqHeuDb5TNx4YLS3yeO53nHyHtlLxCgBdHPfSr5c6PXJ2JJnjVo5sHrnauV8c1jMQkGQ65M28JAa-&quot;&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; version of the Mueller Report. Now that's on the right track. There are tons of great stories in the report. People love stories. Ideally, if there were infinite time, there would be a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; with Trump as president doing and saying the things Trump does and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/24/fucket.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. The actor would be distinguished, presidential, have gravitas, might be black, and possibly a woman, but he or she would say the things Trump says. It would be dramatic not comedic. But there isn't infinite time. Something like the Serial podcast would be ideal. It could start simply, and expand out into all the depravity that's in the Mueller Report. It would need great writers, actors and production. But it could be done reasonably quickly. I'm going to write up a very superficial and novice plan for that, because I have none of the skills needed to make it, but think it's desperately needed.</description>

			<description>Bill Gates' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&amp;v=W5g4sPi1wd4&quot;&gt;biggest failure&lt;/a&gt; in his words is that Microsoft didn't make Android. Hat's off to him. Most great men when looking back on their careers tend to be less specific in their regrets. But imho he's thinking too small. I think his biggest failure was to miss that at the point Windows became the default platform, the role of Microsoft fundamentally changed, and he fought that and that crippled his company and the market. He couldn't make Android at Microsoft any more than GM could make a Tesla. So imho his biggest mistake was not buying a big stake in Google when they were in the garage. And anything else that looked promising. Also it wouldn't surprise me if he read this. One of his strengths as a leader in the PC business was that he engaged with criticism, and learned from it. Most people in his position failed at that, and that's why he won so big, imho.</description>

			<description>My friend Phil Windley posted a stunning &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/23/utah.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of the mountains in Utah on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BzB8AIjh_0E/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. Breath-taking. My first reaction was &quot;America is beautiful.&quot; Not Utah. i thought about that for a bit. Phil had been traveling in Italy and Switzerland, posting pictures of stunningly beautiful places, most of which could not exist in America. because their civilization is older. Of course Utah is a Republican state. Then I thought why doesn't America market itself to Americans. The whole thing, not just pro-this or anti-that. The things that are indivisible. Like the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. That's America, not Republican.</description>

			<description>An idea for a destination resort. Buy some land in the mountains, build an old-style summer camp but for adults. Sleep on bunks, but they’re nice bunks. Everyone eats together. Arts and Crafts, you go on canoeing trips, softball, hikes, campfires, you can smoke weed and have sex, but you have to keep it wholesome, no orgies, this is summer camp (or maybe you had orgies in summer camp). You get to take a kitten home. And of course the lanyard and pottery you make.</description>

			<description>If you're thinking about doing another format for web syndication, don't. There already are &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/927/&quot;&gt;too many&lt;/a&gt;. In fact if you can think of a way to have &lt;i&gt;fewer&lt;/i&gt; web syndication formats, you'd be doing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitzvah&quot;&gt;mitzvah&lt;/a&gt;. One of the fallacies of tech is that anyone is waiting for you to revinvent something that works, no matter how much people appear to be clamoring for it. I've learned over the years that asking, even begging for a feature or product or incompatible format is not an indication that once available people will actually use it. But developers will have to decide whether to support it, and making developers lives more complicated, esp ones who are working for free, is greedy, selfish and not appreciated. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If blacks are African-American aren't whites European-Americans? I am definitely a Euro-Am.

I was born in Brooklyn, raised in Queens (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens&quot;&gt;Jackson Heights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt;). I heard on the radio the other day that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; has a larger population than 15 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population&quot;&gt;US states&lt;/a&gt;. That puts things in perspective. They sure make a lot of noise for such a bunch of punkasses.</description>

			<description>When you buy something online that there is no Consumer Reports or Wirecutter review of, how do you decide what to get? There are a lot of what appear to be review sites on the web, but I guess they're all ads for what they recommend. I don't think the search engines have gotten around to this yet. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=best+bike+cover&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=best+bike+cover&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2868j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;best bike cover.&quot; Which if any of them are serious criticism by people who know the area.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/1141712628928176128&quot;&gt;Mathew Ingram reminds us&lt;/a&gt; that two years ago Twitter said they would revamp their verification program, but they're still doing it on an ad hoc basis. Maybe they should do what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://moversguide.usps.com/mgo/disclaimer&quot;&gt;US Post Office&lt;/a&gt; does when you register a change of address. They charge $1 on your credit card. That in turn gets them your real name and address. That's the information they needed, and it's verified to the extent that the credit card company can verify it, and it seems that's also the information that Twitter needs, at least for people. Not so sure about companies.</description>

			<description>If I were in charge of a search engine, I'd notice if someone does a lot of searches on a specific site, and increase the rank for that site in subsequent searches by that person. It's 2019. It seems search should be at least that smart by now.</description>

			<description>Sometimes I unfollow people on Twitter if I feel there's no chance of me being heard if I respond to what they said, esp if I often want to respond, not in the negative (that's another reason to unfollow) but to add a perspective or offer additional info. It's hard to explain, perhaps, without giving an example, and I don't want to do that because I have nothing against the person I'm unfollowing, it's just that their Twitter presence has gotten so big, or perhaps they've muted me, for whatever reason they don't seem to be able to hear me. I seem to only do this with people who I at one time considered a friend. I guess there is a state of friendship that could be described as &quot;on pause&quot; or &quot;in waiting.&quot; That's why I unfollow.  Until today I couldn't put into words why I was unfollowing, but now I can so here they are. :heh:</description>

There's a lot you can do with it. For example, the native file format of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; is OPML. So it's really good for editing subscription lists for feed readers. And editing blogrolls. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://storage.littleoutliner.com/users/davewiner/listicles/listicle1.html&quot;&gt;listicle&lt;/a&gt; tool takes OPML files as input. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/18.html#a164307&quot;&gt;River6&lt;/a&gt;, coming soon, does a bunch with OPML. There's also &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedbase.io/&quot;&gt;feedBase&lt;/a&gt; which will blow your mind if you love sharing subscription lists. Yes there's a lot to discover in OPML-land and more on the way. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I should write a howto to explain editing subscription lists in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/opmlHowto/dave/editorOpmlOrg/editSubscriptionLists.html&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; for the OPML Editor in 2008. It still runs btw, I use it, sometimes even to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/19/nbalistinopmleditor.png&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt; subscription lists. Two key bits for LO2: 1. You can make outlines public. Look in the File menu. 2. And you can edit the attributes of a headline, click the suitcase icon in the left margin.</description>

			<description>Tomorrow is the NBA Draft and the deals are flying. It should be amazing. After yet another Knickless playoff season, it's interesting to see them back in the conversation somewhat. There were a lot of stupid dreams about the Knicks buying a contending team with their cap space. That's off the table because even Kawhi couldn't turn this team into a contender. The Knicks are in a rebuild, have been for many seasons, and no amount of dealing is going to make them a contender. Even the 76ers and Celtics who played it smart aren't contending yet. But at least they give their fans something to root for. The Celtics should be glad to be rid of Kyrie. Last year's team was much more interesting. Re-sign Horford and trade &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward&quot;&gt;Hayward&lt;/a&gt; for draft picks. The most intriguing idea I heard for the Knicks is to pick up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-chris-paul-kevin-durant-dennis-smith-jr-20190618-bwla5ckvffe5zehjyrmse3iqfq-story.html&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt; on waivers (haha not going to happen) or take on his awful 3-year deal, and get them to throw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Capela&quot;&gt;Capela&lt;/a&gt;, say. In return they get a few mediocre young players that didn't work out (pretty much anyone on the current roster). And then what the hell, sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22carmelo+anthony%22&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; and let him play out his career in the Garden. It's not like anything else is going to happen here for the forseeable future. Sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22jeremy+lin%22&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt; (he can bring his new trophy) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/16.html#a155755&quot;&gt;D'Angelo Russell&lt;/a&gt;, and we might even make the postseason. It'll certainly be entertaining basketball. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🏀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I reworked the feedViewer page. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://river6.scripting.com/feedviewer?url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/feed/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, the single-feed view for &lt;a href=&quot;http://river6.scripting.com/feedviewer?url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/feed/&quot;&gt;Berkeleyside&lt;/a&gt;, the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berkeleyside.com/&quot;&gt;local news site&lt;/a&gt; for Berkeley, where I lived a few years ago. It was founded by my longtime friend Lance Knobel. Since River6 is a river, there's less attention paid to the per-feed viewer, but this time I did a thorough rewrite of it, and added a huge optimization. It no longer has to call back to the server to get the JSON version of the feed, it's baked into the page as the server renders it. One more example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://river6.scripting.com/feedviewer?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;single-feed view&lt;/a&gt; for Scripting News.</description>

			<title>Trump is a TV star</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Trump isn't really a presidential candidate and he certainly isn't a president, not as far as the job is designed by the Constitution. Which the begs the question, what exactly is he?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what he is: A TV star.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Specifically a comedian. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Styled after &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers&quot;&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles&quot;&gt;Don Rickles&lt;/a&gt;. I swear sometimes when I hear Trump talk, something I try to avoid at all costs, I swear I can hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knxuG_hYe-8&quot;&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt; in there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There must be some rude comedians out there who wouldn't mind making a spectacle of Trump hate. And of course hatred for the wimps that vote for him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we don't know if his rallies are still a thing. He's doing one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qVwmfKpps&quot;&gt;tonight&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando. Maybe it'll be a bust. He doesn't really have a new schtick you know. And he wasn't &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; funny in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If he's a dud in his rally, or if he has to amp up the hate to scary levels to get a rise then he's jumped the shark.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But still it wouldn't hurt to put some Trump hate on a stage. Nothing held in reserve. Really vent. We all need to stop being so polite when it comes to Trump. Attack the things he cares about. His net worth. Masculinity. Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the key thing here is the people doing the insults are comedians, not would-be presidents. That's the key. Make Trump all about entertainment by attacking him with entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This started as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1141050003294699520&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

He heard a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Beck&quot;&gt;TV conservative&lt;/a&gt; talk about the America of his youth, how great everything was, how simple, fun, safe. The conservative was born in the mid-60s. When he talks about his youth, he's talking about the 70s. Nixon, Kent State, Watergate, Vietnam, spiraling stagflation, the hostage crisis, OPEC, it goes on and on. It's conceivable that the pundit doesn't know that the world was totally crazy when he was growing up. Lehane concludes, wisely, what conservatives want is to be children again. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another reason the past is so attractive is we know how it turned out. We survived it, so we can romanticize it. It was safe, even though there were lots of scary things, they were fun because we survived. If we do the same things now, the fallacy goes, we'll be safe once again. Of course it doesn't work that way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

Can you recommend a bank that keeps good records?" created="Sun, 16 Jun 2019 15:01:16 GMT" type="outline" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1140271146539110401" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/06/16.html#a150116"/>

The proper attitude is to have people running the place who love the business they're in and are thrilled by the possibility of doing it much better thanks to some new tech. ROI is so boring and dull. Esp from a user standpoint. I'd happily pay more.&quot;</description>

			<description>Here's a free idea for Twitter. Invent linking inside Twitter. So if I want to point to Kawhi Leonard, I could type his name, highlight it, enter his screenname, click OK. It would make Twitter more readable. Only steal from the best. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NBA_UKfans/status/1140278892705538048&quot;&gt;Interesting concept&lt;/a&gt;. Kyrie wants his own team. Of course LeBron has his team. And Kawhi wants one too, he just rented the Raptors for a season (and got paid handsomely for it).</description>
