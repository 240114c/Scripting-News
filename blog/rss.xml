			<description>I don't know if anyone else finds &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt; to be unreliable, as I do, over many years. Here's a scenario. I have to make a minor change to a package. So I increment the version in package.json, and &lt;i&gt;npm publish&lt;/i&gt; it. Then in the app that's using it, I do an &lt;i&gt;npm update. &lt;/i&gt;The update happens. But the app doesn't get the latest version. Something is cached somewhere, because if I look in the node_modules folder, the new version is there. I've resorted to using a lib folder and keeping a copy of the package updated there. But of course I'm reinventing npm in scripts by doing this. Sometimes NPM works as I understand it should, but every so often it goes crazy like this.</description>

			<description>The NYT needs a real public editor, a member of the public who is not a journalist, and has unfettered access to the op-ed page, and can provide perspective for other readers and for the writers and editors.</description>

			<description>I groan when passwords are required to have at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase, a number and/or a special character. I know as a matter of math that these requirements doesn't make passwords better. Does it help people who type &lt;i&gt;asdf&lt;/i&gt; as their password come up with more random strings? Also I hate sites that make me create a new password every so often. I can manage that myself. I suppose maybe they're saying hey we were hacked recently and are requiring everyone to change their passwords instead of making a public statement.</description>

			<title>Why it feels good to stop judging other people</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On Facebook my friend Scott Knaster, who I've known since early Mac days, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1007571732783565?comment_id=1007692502771488&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; about judging things and people. &quot;A few years ago I decided to be really careful about using the word hate when I speak or write. E.g. I don't hate liver, or the Dodgers. It's a little thing, somewhat silly, but I like doing it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why it's easy to be friends with Scott. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;‚≠êÔ∏è&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1007571732783565?comment_id=1007692502771488&amp;reply_comment_id=1007698752770863&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D&quot;&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt;, also on Facebook: &quot;It's good Scott because you hear yourself say these things and deep down inside it creates dissonance. You're human. Judgement of others is way way above your pay grade. It's god's job, whatever that means, certainly not a mortal's job. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I really began to understand this when people in my family started dying. Opinionated and judgemental people. Okay what of their judgement now? Who the fuck cares. And all that angst. They could have saved themselves the pain. Because what they thought re good or bad meant not a thing in the end. Which means to me that it didn't mean a thing when they were alive either.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: There are some topics where judgement is fun. Such as the baseball teams we love and our hate for their enemies. You can see that in Scott's comment about the Dodgers (he's a diehard Giants fan). I would forgive him for hating the Dodgers, because it's basically self-mockery. And I hate do the Yankees. But when you break it down, what is it exactly that I hate? The Bronx? Certainly not. The stadium? Well it is an inferior stadium, no one can argue otherwise. But hate? I'm a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html&quot;&gt;barking farting chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;, looking for a little love and understanding in my short life on planet Earth. My hate wouldn't mean very much. But when it comes to baseball and the Yankees, it's mine. It migh‚Ä† be all I have, so I try to hold on to it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lgm&quot; title=&quot;Let's go Mets!&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/11/metsLogo.png&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; height=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Apparently the question of an Edit button came up in Twitter corporate presser yesterday. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DanielleDigest/status/1161416013688320006&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it isn't a high priority. I've often wondered about this. Facebook lets you edit everything you write, and it hasn't seemed to affect the community in any way I can perceive. I use it all the time. Maybe the question is a technical one for Twitter. Perhaps they built their internal server network around the assumption that content can't be modified. Then it might cost a lot of money they don't have to rebuild their server setup. If this were the case I could see why they wouldn't want to disucss it publicly given how little most reporters and users are aware of how the tech works behind the curtain.</description>

			<title>Should the web be archive.org?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been on a private email thread among tech experts discussing how to preserve the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/&quot;&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/a&gt; site.

			<title>How I got AWS to send my email</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; is a gift. Somehow one of the big tech companies decided that the PC era was worth continuing, and instead of locking up all the useful stuff inside their corporate wall, they went into business providing those tools to any developer who wants to use them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They aren't the only ones, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; is very good too, but AWS does more. Another difference is that Digital Ocean's docs are the best, and AWS's doc are in some ways the worst.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, I have to say AWS docs appear to have all the information about their services. So I can't say their docs are the worst in all ways, they aren't. The problem is the way the docs are written and organized makes it too hard for a newcomer, or someone who only wants to use the most basic functions, slightly beyond Hello World, to find the information they need. First you have to understand everything about the toolkit, and it's presented in a disjointed fashion where the docs assume you already know everything, which makes it virtually impossible for you to get the data you want. Every time I master another AWS toolkit it seems I write one of these pieces to commemorate the experience and hope somehow to encourage Amazon to make it easier for me next time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last year I finally got their email-sending functionality to work. The only &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1159477988712439809&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; was that every email I sent via their service arrived in Gmail with a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that it could be from a hacker (I knew it wasn't, it came from me). It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I learned what was happening and what I had to do to prevent it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First what was happening: I was sending an email from dave.winer@gmail.com through amazonses.com. Gmail said we got the mail, but noticed you didn't send it through gmail.com. Therefore the the big colorful &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I had to do to prevent it: &lt;i&gt;Send the email from another domain and convince Amazon that I was authorized to use that domain.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the place to note that nowhere in the Amazon docs do they say it this clearly. They try to tell you what to do on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/spf.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; with lots of links that center around a protocol called SPF. It turns out that SPF simply requires you to create a TXT record on the domain with a string that says what mail servers are allowed to use it to send mail, and that would be enough to convince AWS that you're cool. It makes sense, it connects the domain with a mail server. The person who set up the TXT record obviously is a god of that domain. But when I set this up per their instructions AWS still called the sender address invalid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then it turns out that I have to use a command line tool to give me a special domain name, and an encrypted value. This contradicts the earlier docs. And I had no idea how to get the command line tool to do this (it seems this would have been a good place for their docs to tell you or link to a place that tells you, but they don't). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I put the project down for a bit, went on Twitter, checked email, went for a walk, did something to cleanse the mental &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate_cleanser&quot;&gt;palate&lt;/a&gt;, came back to the problem and found docs that provided yet another option for convincing AWS that I was authorized to use an email address. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses-procedure.html&quot;&gt;interactive way&lt;/a&gt; to do it through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1#verified-senders-email:&quot;&gt;control panel&lt;/a&gt; for SES. This method worked, and in a familiar way. You tell it what email address you want to use and it sends a message to that address with a link. When you click the link AWS authenticates the address. Everyone who uses the web in 2019 knows how to do this. Why didn't their docs say up front, hey there's a very very very easy way to do this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now I can send email through SES and the receiver won't get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; because I'm playing by the 2019 rules for email sending and using AWS to send the email. I'm a happy camper except for the fact that all this michegas took two days to sort out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Final note:  When we were working on SOAP many years ago, we were dealing with a similar problem. Our colleagues at large tech companies were adding an alphabet soup of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_service_specifications&quot;&gt;protocols&lt;/a&gt; on top of it, and just when you thought you understood what they were doing they added another few, and you were back where you started. I got fed up with this because I just wanted to deploy applications and didn't care about all this extra stuff, so Jake Savin and I wrote what we called &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090303082440/http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;A Busy Developer's Guide to SOAP&lt;/a&gt;. It defined a subset of SOAP that we had verified that works, and provided examples for developers of SOAP implementations to test with to be sure they worked with this subset. We published it, and then logged off the mail lists and got to work writing our blogging and RSS software. It worked. We got what we wanted and the big companies got to add all kinds of extra stuff. It seems to me that AWS is in a similar place. Developers like me who want to build apps, and systems people who want to cover all the bases. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; is a gift. Somehow one of the big tech companies decided that the PC era was worth continuing, and instead of locking up all the useful stuff inside their corporate wall, they went into business providing those tools to any developer who wants to use them." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:21:39 GMT" image="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/12/08/indianaJones.gif" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a152139"/>
				<source:outline text="They aren't the only ones, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; is very good too, but AWS does more. Another difference is that Digital Ocean's docs are the best, and AWS's doc are in some ways the worst." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 16:07:11 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a160711"/>
				<source:outline text="First, I have to say AWS docs appear to have all the information about their services. So I can't say their docs are the worst in all ways, they aren't. The problem is the way the docs are written and organized makes it too hard for a newcomer, or someone who only wants to use the most basic functions, slightly beyond Hello World, to find the information they need. First you have to understand everything about the toolkit, and it's presented in a disjointed fashion where the docs assume you already know everything, which makes it virtually impossible for you to get the data you want. Every time I master another AWS toolkit it seems I write one of these pieces to commemorate the experience and hope somehow to encourage Amazon to make it easier for me next time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:23:13 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a152313"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway, last year I finally got their email-sending functionality to work. The only &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1159477988712439809&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; was that every email I sent via their service arrived in Gmail with a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that it could be from a hacker (I knew it wasn't, it came from me). It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I learned what was happening and what I had to do to prevent it." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:25:19 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a152519"/>
				<source:outline text="First what was happening: I was sending an email from dave.winer@gmail.com through amazonses.com. Gmail said we got the mail, but noticed you didn't send it through gmail.com. Therefore the the big colorful &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:27:10 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a152710"/>
				<source:outline text="What I had to do to prevent it: &lt;i&gt;Send the email from another domain and convince Amazon that I was authorized to use that domain.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:27:56 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a152756"/>
				<source:outline text="This is the place to note that nowhere in the Amazon docs do they say it this clearly. They try to tell you what to do on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/spf.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; with lots of links that center around a protocol called SPF. It turns out that SPF simply requires you to create a TXT record on the domain with a string that says what mail servers are allowed to use it to send mail, and that would be enough to convince AWS that you're cool. It makes sense, it connects the domain with a mail server. The person who set up the TXT record obviously is a god of that domain. But when I set this up per their instructions AWS still called the sender address invalid." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:30:34 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a153034"/>
				<source:outline text="Then it turns out that I have to use a command line tool to give me a special domain name, and an encrypted value. This contradicts the earlier docs. And I had no idea how to get the command line tool to do this (it seems this would have been a good place for their docs to tell you or link to a place that tells you, but they don't)." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:40:03 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a154003"/>
				<source:outline text="It was at this point that I put the project down for a bit, went on Twitter, checked email, went for a walk, did something to cleanse the mental &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate_cleanser&quot;&gt;palate&lt;/a&gt;, came back to the problem and found docs that provided yet another option for convincing AWS that I was authorized to use an email address." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:32:33 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a153233"/>
				<source:outline text="There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses-procedure.html&quot;&gt;interactive way&lt;/a&gt; to do it through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1#verified-senders-email:&quot;&gt;control panel&lt;/a&gt; for SES. This method worked, and in a familiar way. You tell it what email address you want to use and it sends a message to that address with a link. When you click the link AWS authenticates the address. Everyone who uses the web in 2019 knows how to do this. Why didn't their docs say up front, hey there's a very very very easy way to do this." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:41:29 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a154129"/>
				<source:outline text="So now I can send email through SES and the receiver won't get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; because I'm playing by the 2019 rules for email sending and using AWS to send the email. I'm a happy camper except for the fact that all this michegas took two days to sort out." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:44:12 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a154412"/>
				<source:outline text="Final note:  When we were working on SOAP many years ago, we were dealing with a similar problem. Our colleagues at large tech companies were adding an alphabet soup of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_service_specifications&quot;&gt;protocols&lt;/a&gt; on top of it, and just when you thought you understood what they were doing they added another few, and you were back where you started. I got fed up with this because I just wanted to deploy applications and didn't care about all this extra stuff, so Jake Savin and I wrote what we called &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090303082440/http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;A Busy Developer's Guide to SOAP&lt;/a&gt;. It defined a subset of SOAP that we had verified that works, and provided examples for developers of SOAP implementations to test with to be sure they worked with this subset. We published it, and then logged off the mail lists and got to work writing our blogging and RSS software. It worked. We got what we wanted and the big companies got to add all kinds of extra stuff. It seems to me that AWS is in a similar place. Developers like me who want to build apps, and systems people who want to cover all the bases." created="Sat, 10 Aug 2019 15:49:29 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html#a154929"/>

			<description>I got an email from a long-time reader saying the thing that shocked him about my early web writing was that I told the truth. I wasn't trying to sell you anything. I just wrote what occurred to me. He was a mainframe programmer. I've thought about that, and I'd love to understand how one can be a programmer and not &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; be searching for the truth. Unlike just about any other profession I can think of, ours depends on telling the truth.&lt;i&gt;You can't lie to a compiler&lt;/i&gt; is one of my programming mottos. Garbage in garbage out. I write blog posts the same way a tester writes reviews of software. You have to be ready to hear the unvarnished truth. That's the ethos of blogging as far as I'm concerned. And it's why tech bloggers can do it better than most. Not saying they do of course. There was some real shabby blogging around HTTPS and &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, I kept wanting to ask if they debug their software with that kind of logic? (The equiv of asking a troll if they kiss their mother with that mouth.)</description>

			<title>Scripting News in email</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/08.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; Scripting News looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/09/scriptingNewsInEmailSnapshot.png&quot;&gt;pretty good&lt;/a&gt; in email. Learned a lot. Most of the problems were with how HTML email works these days, not Mailchimp. I needed to factor it out to see that. On the other hand they do some stuff that I can't &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYsw0KVRjCM&quot;&gt;abide&lt;/a&gt;, so this is a necessary exercise. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Caveat: I only tested in Gmail running in Chrome on a Mac. I'm sure other browsers on other machines and other email clients will raise their own kind of hell. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some of what I learned:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can only use standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography#Web-safe_fonts&quot;&gt;web fonts&lt;/a&gt;. I'm using Arial for everything.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can't include CSS files, all CSS has to be in-line in a &amp;lt;style&gt; element in the &amp;lt;head&gt; section.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Styles for &amp;lt;body&gt; are ignored.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't use lists unless you want their indentation. There appears to be no way to override it. I was using lists, per standard best practices, for stories. I did a hack and replaced all &amp;lt;ul&gt;s and &amp;lt;li&gt;s with divs, and styled them the way I wanted them to look. (This will fuck up deeply nested lists in my stories. Thinking about how to avoid that. Come to think of it, it will probably fuck up this very list. Heh.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm using AWS to send the mail, and I'm going to have to do some kind of dance to configure it to let me send email from an address I never use. I can't use my gmail address, because I am not sending the email from gmail. That is a new architecture of the net created by who-the-hell-knows since I last did any programming with email. Not saying it's bad, it was something I had to learn about. I suspect that it will be a rejiggering of the dance you have to go to get an HTTPS server, why not use the same dance? I will be learning more about this for sure. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html&quot;&gt;followup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You see inside a young girl's life, her self-doubt, relationships with friends, the evolving meaning of cool, trying out the idea of sex, sizing up her own future and past. Cringeworthy in places. I keep thinking about it, a sign of something worthwhile.</description>

			<description>I would of course like to tell you about my own eighth grade here, except I skipped that grade. I went to junior high between elementary and high school, and they had the option for students who passed a test to skip the grade. I opted-in. My sixth grade teacher, I found out much later, was opposed to this, she felt I was too immature and needed the grade to help get ready for high school. Considering what I did in high school, she might have had a point. Or it could be that she mistook creativity for immaturity. She was a good teacher, one of the best I ever had. I once raised my hand enthusiastically and burst out &quot;Mom mom call on me!&quot; -- to my great embarrassment. She said that was high praise. It was. That's how relaxed I was with her.</description>

			<title>Linux Journal wind-down</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today comes news that Linux Journal is shutting down. They say they'll be able to keep the archive online for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now here's an opportunity to do the wind-down the right way. Linux Journal isn't the ordinary publication that lets the domain registration lapse and stops paying the storage bills for the archive. And then next year it's a porn site or a phishing destination. I'm assuming the last people at Linux Journal care about the accumulated know-how and history at the site. And this event raises the question of how to do such a wind-down best. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the archive remains online and accessible at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/&quot;&gt;linuxjournal.com&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future so all pointers into the site continue to work. This might not cost a lot of money especially if the site is largely static content. So the first question is this -- is it? And if so, how much is there? With that data we can estimate what the annual cost will be and then set about raising the money. I would be happy to kick in some myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If not, then perhaps we can find a way to enumerate the URLs and then set up a service that redirects them to the archive.org version of the content? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps we could write a scraper that visits the pages, downloads a snapshot and stores them in static files. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;According to the site we have a couple of weeks to do the research and moving. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Two Democratic presidential candidates said historic things in the last week, but they have mostly gone unnoticed or misunderstood. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/bill-dagostino/2019/07/30/buttigieg-alludes-changing-2nd-amendment-cnn-moderators-ignore&quot;&gt;Pete Buttigieg&lt;/a&gt; said if we want change we're going to have to amend the Constitution. He's absolutely right. Changing the president, even taking the majority in the Senate won't accomplish much if a minority can overturn the whole thing any time they get it together. That's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, that's what has to change. Another thing that has to change is journalism. They can't incorporate new realities into their view of the world. They ask questions about Trump as if he were a normal president, one who had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-finance/trump-says-wont-divest-from-his-business-while-president-idUSKBN14V21I&quot;&gt;divested&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/the-presidents-tax-returns/&quot;&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; before taking office. Trump is a Russian oligarch. He takes his orders from Putin. Any question about the president that doesn't accept this context is a question from Dreamland. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1159116877316132864&quot;&gt;Beto O'Rourke&lt;/a&gt; busted through this crazy wall in the aftermath of the El Paso massacre. It's why we need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/depose&quot;&gt;depose&lt;/a&gt; the people who run journalism, asap. Why shouldn't the Democratic candidates help us transform politics and journalism? If they don't do that, why are they running? (To paraphrase Elizabeth Warren, who has done her &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/454500-warren-presses-pelosi-on-impeachment-some-things-are-above-politics&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; to transform how our politics and journalism work.)</description>

			<title>Why we fear death</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a theory about why we fear death. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a survival trait. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Animals that didn't fear death died. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Animals that feared death tended to live. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words most of us are descended from animals that were scared of dying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Please pay attention to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/beto-orourke-responds-to-mass-shootings-what-the-fuck.html&quot;&gt;what Beto did&lt;/a&gt; with the journalists.

			<description>I read a story about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.voanews.com/usa/when-mass-shootings-drive-survivors-suicide?fbclid=IwAR10pwVUJkftmr4duAxaYg3Ozwd8ffzN41PPZdGWGyDdoeEHaoPdpgM5nAY&quot;&gt;survivors&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting&quot;&gt;Las Vegas massacre&lt;/a&gt; and it opened my eyes. We don't even help them out with their medical bills. So the travesty of gun violence is multiplied by the inhumanity of our health care system.</description>

			<description>My dear departed hippie &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt; started a bums union. They would revoke your union card if you were caught working. He gave it a name. The Amalgamated Bums and Drifters of America. It was a joke of course. He loved to work.</description>
