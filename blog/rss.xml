			<description>With all the progress being made in machine learning it's a wonder that the quality of phone calls is so bad. My brain can do the filtering to compensate for weak signals and even interpolate short outages. But it's a strain. Isn't this something software can help us with??</description>

			<description>In 1995 I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Software is a process, it's never finished, it's always evolving. That's its nature. We know our software sucks. But it's shipping! Next time we'll do better, but even then it will be shitty. The only software that's perfect is one you're dreaming about. Real software crashes, loses data, is hard to learn and hard to use. But it's a process. We'll make it less shitty. Just watch!&quot; So it occurred to me that the Beatles song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGlo9LzmOME&quot;&gt;Getting Better&lt;/a&gt; would be a great song to teach computer science students. Sing it before every class. &quot;Getting so much better all the time.&quot;</description>

			<description>My home heating system needs work, so I went to the website for the heating guy, and had a choice of contacting them by phone or through a web form. I went with the form. I was impressed with how well-designed it was, except it required an &quot;evening phone&quot; which is the same as my day phone, i.e. my iPhone. Probably shouldn't even ask for two phones these days, it's kind of an obsolete concept. Anyway, my gripe is this. After carefully composing the message, I spaced out on copying it to the clipboard, a time-honored defense against buggy software, it just cleared the form after I clicked the Send button, which was a WTF moment for me. Much better would be to confirm that the mail was sent, both on-screen and via an email. Now I'm in a place where I don't know if the email was sent, certainly don't want to re-write the message, and in case the other one &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; sent, it'll look like I'm crazy for sending the same message twice, but with different words. Show empathy for the user, and confirm so they can relax.</description>

			<description>I should talk with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicine.duke.edu/faculty/anton-zuiker&quot;&gt;Anton Zuiker&lt;/a&gt; more often. Today he showed me a project he's doing at Duke University to create podcasts for their community which is very expansive to include staff and the patients. It's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.duke.edu/listening/podcast/&quot;&gt;Voices of Duke Health&lt;/a&gt;. What an incredible project. They already have 16 episodes.</description>

			<title>Kurt Vonnegut was right</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I came up with a title for my book of memories on my bike ride. I found a simple idea that ties all my observations together. It goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kurt Vonnegut was right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. If you read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan&quot;&gt;Sirens of Titan&lt;/a&gt; you'll know what I mean. The ending. And pretty much every other book he wrote, all were so funny because the truth is funny, that is if you believe what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut&quot;&gt;Vonnegut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut#Works&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; which I do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A media hack is different from a software hack. Podcasting is a media hack. Sure, there was a little software needed to get the bootstrap going. But the innovation was the combination of HTTP, MP3 and RSS. It's like a S'more, which is a &quot;cookie hack.&quot;</description>

			<title>Twittertube&amp;trade;</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I ran Twitter, I'd create a developer toolkit for creating setups like screen2.io. You'd specify a YouTube video. The chat part of the interface would just be Twitter, so your Twitter followers would read what you're saying (or not, it would be a preference). Now I'd have a way to watch live video feeds from YouTube in Twitter. And of course the &quot;developers&quot; wouldn't be super techie devs. They would be people who are good discussion leaders, and people who are good at keeping spammers out. You could share revenue with them to make it really grow. You could call it twittertube. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism and jury duty. I agreed strongly with what Emily Bell said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilybell/status/1148298094146129921&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Jury duty is a powerful idea, and it works. It's the basis for our justice system. I've written about jury duty many times, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/08/whyShouldYouJoinAJury.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/whatILearnedFromJuryDuty&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/05/29/juryDutyDay2.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/03/01/juryduty.html&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Observation. If you're going to use a CDN that doesn't let you overlay your own domain name, and your code is coming from an S3 bucket, it's much easier to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com&quot;&gt;s3.amazonaws.com&lt;/a&gt; and no less independent of another entity. I imagine this is okay with Amazon because it's lock-in. But this is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/code/nbariver/index.html&quot;&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; that works over HTTPS, the URL Is uglier than shit, but it works. It's an important milestone because my users have legit reasons to want to make rivers accessible via HTTPS.</description>

			<description>Ever notice that mostly what people post on Twitter is designed to get attention for the author. I think that's due to the award incentive of the system. Flow == more followers == power and prestige. I wonder if there's a way to reward people based on the depth and originality of ideas they post, or RT. Zero points for repeating a talking point from a random hack on Meet The Press. Huge points for an idea that makes people want to consume less.</description>

			<title>Self-sovereign howto?</title>

			<description>Interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2019/07/05/feature/haunted-by-the-reagan-era/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; says the current Democratic leadership is haunted by Reagan. Here's what I think happened. Nixon. Watergate. The country needed to cleanse itself so it elected a Mr Rogers type, Jimmy Carter, who we knew for sure wouldn't do the nasty stuff Nixon was doing. He came into DC thinking he could change things, instead DC ignored him, and everyone could see it/feel it, and then the hostage crisis, the failed rescue, America was mostly over Nixon and we wanted to kick ass and Reagan came along and said Let's Kick Ass and people looked at Carter, talking about a great national malaise, and there were gas lines, and the world was pushing us around so we said Fuck yeah. So the Repubs found something that worked, and the Dems never caught on. So maybe AOC et al are right, the Repubs are buffoons and criminals, and everyone knows it, including most voters, so what a Democrat has to do is say we kick ass, but we're a team and we have to work together. I don't know, it could work. I think the most convincing character running for president is Jay Inslee, believe or not. And if we could get Gavin Newsom to run, he's the closest we have to a Democratic Reagan.</description>

			<source:outline text="Interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2019/07/05/feature/haunted-by-the-reagan-era/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; says the current Democratic leadership is haunted by Reagan. Here's what I think happened. Nixon. Watergate. The country needed to cleanse itself so it elected a Mr Rogers type, Jimmy Carter, who we knew for sure wouldn't do the nasty stuff Nixon was doing. He came into DC thinking he could change things, instead DC ignored him, and everyone could see it/feel it, and then the hostage crisis, the failed rescue, America was mostly over Nixon and we wanted to kick ass and Reagan came along and said Let's Kick Ass and people looked at Carter, talking about a great national malaise, and there were gas lines, and the world was pushing us around so we said Fuck yeah. So the Repubs found something that worked, and the Dems never caught on. So maybe AOC et al are right, the Repubs are buffoons and criminals, and everyone knows it, including most voters, so what a Democrat has to do is say we kick ass, but we're a team and we have to work together. I don't know, it could work. I think the most convincing character running for president is Jay Inslee, believe or not. And if we could get Gavin Newsom to run, he's the closest we have to a Democratic Reagan." created="Sat, 06 Jul 2019 15:09:47 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/07/06/aBeautifulDayInTheNeighborhood.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/07/06.html#a150947"/>

			<description>My holiday weekend binge is turning out to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Survivor_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Designated Survivor&lt;/a&gt;. It's very network-TV, but Kiefer Sutherland keeps it kind of interesting. I hope it might break out and become excellent. Still in season 1.</description>

			<title>The future is ours</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1955. I am 64 years old. When I go to the doctor now I ask about Medicare. Things change when you pass 60, really mind-bending things. For example, I'm legally unemployable starting next year. Most companies and governments require their employees to retire at 65. At a practical level I am already unemployable. They certainly aren't hiring many people at 64.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Except here's the thing young folk can't understand until they actually live this. There's this bewildering feeling of When The Fuck Did This Happen and Why? I know you intellectualize it, I did. You realize &quot;Life is short&quot; but really believe me, you have no idea until you look back on all those years and think -- really? That's it? It's a cliche, but it's deep. And if you think about these things, as I do, always have, you realize the incredible wisdom of the phrase &lt;i&gt;Live In The Moment. &lt;/i&gt;You can hear the words, but until you get there on your own path, they really are just words.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Live In The Moment is true like Breathe the Air or Drink the Water. Living only happens in the moment. There is no life in the past or future, only the now. You can get lessons from the past, and lessons are important, for sure -- but no actual living happens there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so why is this important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about the important stuff, the stuff of the future, the stuff we are sure is coming -- the Climate Crisis as the prime example, our discussion wanders into the past or future too quickly. As an old person, one who isn't actually ready for that, I think about the future, a lot. Yet at some level, the thought does occur to me that it is not my future. But that mainly comes up when I am silenced or put down because of age. In my heart the future is as much mine as it is some arrogant naive and clueless 30-something person. Yes I'm angry at being ignored or swept aside. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are also wrong when they make sweeping statements about the bad stuff my generation did. It goes the other way too. My generation gave you an open networking system of immense power. The millennial generation took that wonder of human ingenuity, discipline, cooperation and idealism and turned it into Facebook. Zuck was born in 1984. Your generation owns him, not mine. As a hippie boomer I am proud of what we've done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, there were all kinds of boomers. People who lived in the deep south dreamed of proms and went to frat parties (btw I went to college with them) and wanted comfortable suburban lives, very much &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love&quot;&gt;unlike&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_hippie_movement&quot;&gt;hippies&lt;/a&gt;. There were working class Republicans, part of Nixon's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority&quot;&gt;Silent Majority&lt;/a&gt;. People who voted for Nixon, were of course not hippies. There were the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Hat_Riot&quot;&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and the National Guards who killed the students at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings&quot;&gt;Kent State&lt;/a&gt;. There was an antiwar movment but there was also a Love It Or Leave It movement. There was a draft too. Sure there were a million people at Woodstock. But this is a big country. Hippies were then, as they are now, a small minority, they were certainly not a whole generation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's a response to young people of 2019. Your life is finite and very short. In a few moments you'll be old. Imho the future isn't yours any more than it's mine, not at a species or evolution level. You are just a &lt;i&gt;representative&lt;/i&gt; of the future, you are not an embodiment of it. We are contemporaries. You are, in this moment, no more a representative of the future than I am. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Strange sounds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's this strange (to me) sound all through the night, and last night at around 3AM, I decided to record it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few notes first.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I went outside to record it I realized there were lots of animals making this sound. They were all over the place. In bed it seemed there was just one. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You may have to turn up the volume. It was very quiet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You will also hear my breathing. Sorry. Should've held my breath.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No crickets?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/07/05/strangeNightSounds.m4a&quot;&gt;the audio&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I have another idea for how to bootstrap the impeachment as mere citizens, now. If you're registered as a Democrat, change your registration to independent. That would surely get Nancy Pelosi to pay attention. I bet as soon as it became a thing, even just a few thousand switches, she'd tell Nadler to start the hearings and declare her intent to have a vote on impeachment. It's time to make the Dems feel the risks Trump is taking on behalf of all of us.</description>

			<description>There was a time when every woman I met was named Kim. It's happening again, only this time they're all named Maryanne or Marianne or Maryann. There have been four so far. Just got an email from a person working on a project that I'm also working on. Of course, her name is Marianne. My dear departed &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt; used to say he was a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2007/01/02.html#brockmansQuestion&quot;&gt;Church of Non-functional Probabilities&lt;/a&gt;. Things would happen to him that could not be predicted by any legit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution&quot;&gt;probability distribution&lt;/a&gt;. This is an example of a message from god. I was doubting His or Her existence. I don't doubt it now. And further I think my dear uncle in heaven is having a good laugh at his still-living nephew.

			<description>An idea for a Netflix-style scifi, tragicomedy, about a race of aliens that are actually bacteria that fly between solar systems in alien spacecraft landing on inhabited planets and reducing the dominant species to slaves. They are transmitted from human to human via farts. Most humans die when infected, some survive, to be controlled by the alien life form, and to infect others of course. But a very tiny minority resist both dying and being controlled, but they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; transmit the infection, and they must race to develop an antidote or else humanity is doomed. Hilarity ensues when people develop ways to be insulated from each other's farts, or when it's impossible, killing infected humans before they can transmit the disease. Rumors fly that certain races and religions are especially virulent transmitters. Time is running short when Season 1 ends.</description>

Rumors fly that certain races and religions are especially virulent transmitters.

			<description>The Knicks must stop playing tricks, no more flailing, or developing only young talent, just play the game to win. Try to get better. The league has been set up now so that tanking doesn't work. The odds on getting a #1 pick are not good and the free agents don't want to play for a team that tanked. Furthermore, the Knicks should stop doing what other teams did to get rebooted (Philadelphia and Boston are two examples, now the Nets are another). Just play and deal, and (try to) win.</description>

			<title>Privilege is a hierarchy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This originated as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1146061518699581441&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the journalism &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; I keynoted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/14.html&quot;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, with @rmack as my partner, I was criticized for being &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/18.html#a211113&quot;&gt;privileged&lt;/a&gt;. Only now, months later am I formulating the proper response. I'm going to try to outline it here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I'm privileged. But so are you. Even if you're a woman or a person of color. There is a hierarchy of privilege. Maybe your parents were born in this country, so you have deep roots and a large loving family. That's a kind of privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe your parents had wonderful childhoods, cared for by loving parents who always wanted the best for them. Or maybe you were raised by parents who were horribly abused, not just by their family but by the world. You can't necessarily see that in a person's age, gender, or race. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I chose to do something hard, that I loved, that represented my aspiration not just for myself but for you, and everyone else.  But when you listened, to the extent that you did, all you felt was bitterness, so deeply you had to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What should I have done differently? And assuming you are correct and that my privilege oppressed someone else (hard to see how) I'm now getting my comeuppance, not from you. Basically my work offended so many people that getting asked to tell my story is the rarest thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And even so, I couldn't tell my pretty relevant story given that innovation is so needed in journalism, without being attacked. I didn't feel that particular fear before speaking, but if I ever do it again, I will.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't a big fan of Bernie Sanders, but he said something wonderful after the debate last Thursday to the challenge that it was time for older people to step aside and let the young people lead. He said no. These ideas are too important. And that's what I say too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
