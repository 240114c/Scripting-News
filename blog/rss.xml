			<description>I have another idea for how to bootstrap the impeachment as mere citizens, now. If you're registered as a Democrat, change your registration to independent. That would surely get Nancy Pelosi to pay attention. I bet as soon as it became a thing, even just a few thousand switches, she'd tell Nadler to start the hearings and declare her intent to have a vote on impeachment. It's time to make the Dems feel the risks Trump is taking on behalf of all of us.</description>

			<description>There was a time when every woman I met was named Kim. It's happening again, only this time they're all named Maryanne or Marianne or Maryann. There have been four so far. Just got an email from a person working on a project that I'm also working on. Of course, her name is Marianne. My dear departed &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt; used to say he was a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2007/01/02.html#brockmansQuestion&quot;&gt;Church of Non-functional Probabilities&lt;/a&gt;. Things would happen to him that could not be predicted by any legit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution&quot;&gt;probability distribution&lt;/a&gt;. This is an example of a message from god. I was doubting His or Her existence. I don't doubt it now. And further I think my dear uncle in heaven is having a good laugh at his still-living nephew. If you can read this, Ken, I miss you! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>An idea for a Netflix-style scifi, tragicomedy, about a race of aliens that are actually bacteria that fly between solar systems in alien spacecraft landing on inhabited planets and reducing the dominant species to slaves. They are transmitted from human to human via farts. Most humans die when infected, some survive, to be controlled by the alien life form, and to infect others of course. But a very tiny minority resist both dying and being controlled, but they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; transmit the infection, and they must race to develop an antidote or else humanity is doomed. Hilarity ensues when people develop ways to be insulated from each other's farts, or when it's impossible, killing infected humans before they can transmit the disease. Rumors fly that certain races and religions are especially virulent transmitters. Time is running short when Season 1 ends.</description>

			<description>The Knicks must stop playing tricks, no more flailing, or developing only young talent, just play the game to win. Try to get better. The league has been set up now so that tanking doesn't work. The odds on getting a #1 pick are not good and the free agents don't want to play for a team that tanked. Furthermore, the Knicks should stop doing what other teams did to get rebooted (Philadelphia and Boston are two examples, now the Nets are another). Just play and deal, and (try to) win.</description>

			<title>Privilege is a hierarchy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This originated as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1146061518699581441&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the journalism &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; I keynoted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/14.html&quot;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, with @rmack as my partner, I was criticized for being &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/18.html#a211113&quot;&gt;privileged&lt;/a&gt;. Only now, months later am I formulating the proper response. I'm going to try to outline it here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I'm privileged. But so are you. Even if you're a woman or a person of color. There is a hierarchy of privilege. Maybe your parents were born in this country, so you have deep roots and a large loving family. That's a kind of privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe your parents had wonderful childhoods, cared for by loving parents who always wanted the best for them. Or maybe you were raised by parents who were horribly abused, not just by their family but by the world. You can't necessarily see that in a person's age, gender, or race. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I chose to do something hard, that I loved, that represented my aspiration not just for myself but for you, and everyone else.  But when you listened, to the extent that you did, all you felt was bitterness, so deeply you had to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What should I have done differently? And assuming you are correct and that my privilege oppressed someone else (hard to see how) I'm now getting my comeuppance, not from you. Basically my work offended so many people that getting asked to tell my story is the rarest thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And even so, I couldn't tell my pretty relevant story given that innovation is so needed in journalism, without being attacked. I didn't feel that particular fear before speaking, but if I ever do it again, I will.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't a big fan of Bernie Sanders, but he said something wonderful after the debate last Thursday to the challenge that it was time for older people to step aside and let the young people lead. He said no. These ideas are too important. And that's what I say too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
