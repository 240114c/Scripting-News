			<description>Watched a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Sources&quot;&gt;Reliable Sources&lt;/a&gt; — Trump has to escalate the outrageousness of his trolling or it doesn’t penetrate. That’s why there was so little coverage of his abortion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/27/trump-wisconsin-rally-1291372&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Every time I see a for-the-record post on Medium, I think about how we've failed to solve the easiest most basic problem in 25-plus years of blogging on the web. How to put something on the record with at least an attempt at longevity.</description>

			<description>I've been steadily building out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;my home theater&lt;/a&gt;. Got a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KVQBA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;subwoofer&lt;/a&gt; last week, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V2QVEQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;center channel&lt;/a&gt; speaker came today. One thing I've realized is that Netflix has the best sound and picture of any of the other streamers, some of which are really shitty. So I always turn to Netflix to test a new setup. Also HBO has very high quality. Game of Thrones is great for testing, even though the first two episodes of the season have been very disney or hallmark.</description>

From now on (knock wood) my posts should appear in the stream. That way it might be easier to tell at what point in the flow a comment appeared. At this time it does not update posts as they change.

			<title>Rebooting America</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/03/17/135334.html&quot;&gt;Biden should not&lt;/a&gt; run. But he's running. It is what it is and it's even worse than it appears. I look at Joe's eyes and I see they are the eyes of a very old man. Black dots. This happened to the eyes of my grandparents as they got close to the end. Joe seems to be in good health, but the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are tradeoffs with Joe. He's old. That means there's a lot to criticize, but it also means he has a time-tested idea of what America is. I know young people think they have experienced things we will never understand, and that's true, but it's also true a person of Biden's age has experienced things they will never know, except in history books, and they always tell the story of the winner, not the struggle and the choices that led to the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems you'd want someone like Biden around during the campaign with a voice people listen to. I think every one of the Democrats who will not be the nominee must view it that way. A billion dollars will be raised during the primary. Think about the good you can do with that, in communicating important ideas, and achieving positive results for the Americans you hope to represent. All my life I've been waiting for a candidate to realize that although they're probably not going to win, there are things they can do to make things better right now, as a person with a powerful microphone, as a potential president. Maybe Biden is the one who gets that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's already said something that needs to be said and has put Trump on the defensive, re-stating his &lt;a href=&quot;https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-doubles-down-on-very-fine-people&quot;&gt;Nazi-friendly&lt;/a&gt; ideas. I think that's a good way to start. Call the Nazi a Nazi. And Trump certainly is that. But we got tired of HRC advertising only how awful Trump was -- we got it. How about some uplifty poetry to go with the negative bits. We want to feel we're part of a cause when we go into the voting booth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope Biden remembers how he launched his campaign, and others follow suit. We're all trying to reboot America. Let's keep focused on that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

He's basically found a new level in the game. He is very knowledgable of trivia, but also risks a lot. And that's why he wins.</description>

			<description>There's a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=chat&quot;&gt;Chat tab&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News. I've been planning to do this for some time, moving my basic &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/chat&quot;&gt;json.chat&lt;/a&gt; shell into a tab on Scripting News in place of Disqus, which has become an embarrassment. I still haven't figured out a bunch of stuff, like when rollover happens, causing the chat stream to reset. For now if you have a comment on something on Scripting News, post it there. But it must still follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Comment Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Keep it short, only add information to an existing post if it's asked for or you're pretty sure it would be welcome. No spam, and nothing that looks like spam, and of course nothing personal. I delete comments without explanation. I can block people here as with Disqus, so please respect the guidelines. ;-)</description>

			<description>The next thing are the hearings to determine if the House impeaches. No one knows where we will be after the hearings and the people who say they know are wrong. Far from hurting the Dems chances in the 2020 election, the stuff coming out of the hearings will electrify the campaign. There will be all kinds of Republican unsavoryness on parade. A circular firing squad for the ages.</description>

			<title>You should use Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I stopped on the street yesterday to talk with a couple of neighbors. The question of whether they should use Facebook came up. They read the NY Times and hear how bad FB is, they don't want to use it. They say the same phrases the NYT uses. Educated thoughtful people, want to do what's right, but they're getting their truth from a conflicted organization, imho. I thought about it, and here's a follow-up email I wrote.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nice to meet you X, and see you Y! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought some more about Facebook, of course it's a choice whether to use it or not, and they are the worst most greedy people in the world, they took from the web and refuse to give back, and there's very little nice I can say about the company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I think the news pubs are doing a disservice by trashing FB so thoroughly without offering an alternative that works the way it should. What they really want is the rest of us to be quiet and listen to them. That is not going to happen because what goes on on the net is too valuable and people won't give it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would love to see a world where we could use these great tools without giving up anything. We knew how to make that and it existed before FB, but they made it easier and figured out how to give it away free, and people didn't care to know about the cost...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- I've decided this isn't my battle. I'm going to get the benefit, and not worry about the cost. Nothing I can do about it anyway. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I should probably make this a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, the corrupt president now has a corrupt attorney general. That's something to factor into your thinking.</description>

			<title>It's time to impeach</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ignore the Constitution?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Those who say impeach is not the answer, what would Trump have to do in order to make impeach the right answer? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Well here's the thing, what makes you think he won't do much worse between now and inauguration day in 2021?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He wouldn't have any restraints between now and then.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And BTW, what restraints would there be on the next president? Maybe not such a buffoon as Trump. If we don't impeach and remove, we no longer have a Constitution that's enforced re the president. This guy has been ignoring it. We would all be ignoring it if he isn't impeached and removed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrupt attorney general&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The corrupt president now has a corrupt attorney general. That's something to factor into your thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One implication of this is that all the other DoJ cases that are open now, will soon be closed. It's within his power to close them. So if you're thinking about SDNY cases, forget it. They're not going to happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The only thing the people control now is the House. Are we going to let the Democrats make this a partisan thing? If you're an independent, now's the time to express that independence. You shouldn't care if a Democrat gets re-elected, if they're just as corrupt at the Repubs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump's corruption is a moving target. He's found new people who go along with his most wantonly destructive acts, so the future offenses will be worse than the ones we're reviewing now.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There comes a point when the sins of the president are so huge that Congress, no matter which party occupies it, has an obligation to start impeachment. Think about it this way. How would you feel if the Repubs held the House and refused to impeach, at this point.</description>

			<description>I think the House should decide whether to start impeachment hearings in a few weeks, after the Mueller report has been a bit more settled in. Unlike the gun debate, Dems won’t lose the power to act in a few weeks.</description>

			<description>The only question at the Austin conference wasn't really a question. In the back row a woman said I was talking about privilege when I was telling the story of the very earliest days of blogging. I said there were no barriers to entry. I guess she imagined the barriers were there, and I would have seen them and felt them if I weren't a privileged white male. She wasn't so nice about the way she said that, btw. And I didn't figure that out in the moment. The truth is, as I said, there were no barriers. So they couldn't have stopped anyone if they were another race or gender, they just weren't there. If a 40-something black woman from the east coast tried to start blogging, I think it would have worked, and instead of coming out of Silicon Valley, blogging might have come out of some other community, and have evolved in a different way. No matter what they would have had to know a little scripting, and be curious about how the protocols of the Internet worked. Maybe my privilege made it more likely I'd be interested. But I think it was more hereditary, and as I said at the conference, the impulse to blog was something I inherited from my mother, not a white man. Anyway, at first, I promise you, it was more a question of courage and imagination than any deep skills. That came later when we tried to create end-user software for blogging. For that you'd have to know a lot of programming techniques. I for one would have been anxious to work with whoever was the first blogger. &lt;i&gt;Working together&lt;/i&gt; is what I'm all about.</description>

			<description>After buying a house, moving, then going to a conference in Austin and getting a cold, I tried to have a productive programming day and got absolutely nowhere. That hasn't happened in a long time. Partially I think it's because I'm relaxed? Maybe I don't give as much of a shit? Or who knows. But it's a fact, I got nothing done today. I guess it happens. I'm going to spend the rest of the day doing the following: 1. Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt; season 1.  2. Catching up on the latest in The Mueller Report. 3. Watching a bit of NBA Playoff action. 4. Are the Mets playing?</description>

			<title>Roku, the entertainment desktop</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been slowly rebuilding my home entertainment system, in a bootstrapping kind of way. My old system was built around a huge Denon receiver I bought in 2007, two Polk Audio towers (also 2007), and a 45 or 55 inch Sony Bravia screen bought in 2010 when I moved to NYC. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed in all those years, and I wanted to get caught up. First, I bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798B2L5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;65-inch 4K TCL Roku&lt;/a&gt; screen and a cheap &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BJT931Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Onkyo receiver&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted immediately to get 2019-level equipment. Still using the Polk Audio towers. The picture quality was an amazing improvement over what I had before. Like many others, the picture was weird until I made the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation&quot;&gt;motion smoothing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/402240/how-to-disable-motion-smoothing-on-a-roku-tv/&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got a cheap Polk audio &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KVQBA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;subwoofer&lt;/a&gt;. I never thought about how it would connect to the receiver. Then I assumed there would be speaker wire ports on both ends and I would hook it up as I did with the towers, using banana plugs. I was surprised to learn how subwoofers connect to receivers these days. Using some very legacy tech, totally non-digital -- simple old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D5H8IIU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;RCA plugs&lt;/a&gt;. I went on to Amazon hoping to find some, then I realized of course they would be easy to find. An entire new market has developed here. Super long mono RCA jacks, with gold plating. As someone who studies standards evolution in tech, this is both odd and gratifying. The old way just worked and no one screwed with it. Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also was pleased to learn about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#HDMI_Ethernet_and_Audio_Return_Channel&quot;&gt;ARC&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol that allows sound to flow back out over an HDMI wire. It means you only need one HDMI cable to hook up a receiver to a screen. It allows the receiver to play audio that's coming in through the TV. I was getting ready to set up an optical connection, as I did in the old setup. It's not needed any longer. I love factoring. Some good standards work. Met the customer need (I had actually thought of this while I was hooking up the TV and the receiver). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another great connection is now you can access the user interface of the receiver on the TV. It's weird to use their remote on a screen I usually use via the Roku remote, but it works. Onkyo's UI was understandable, but there are some very simple best practice type changes they should make. And it's hard to find out how to get the configuration screen back. I think part of the reason the sub-woofer doesn't work yet is that when I configured it initially, I told it I didn't have a sub-woofer. I think it was a mistake of them to ask, and a mistake of me to tell the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I'd like to be able to control the receiver through the Roku settings hierarchy. I imagine there either is a way for a receiver to do this, or they're working on it. It's too obvious a direction to head in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I assume Apple has tried to buy Roku. They have an incredibly valuable asset, the desktop of the digital entertainment world. It could be a franchise like Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm learning a lot about a tech in an area I have loved since I was a kid. Pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
