			<description>I wonder when the world is going to be fed up with us. Half of the US population feels like they've been screwed, and the funny thing is it's both halfs. And meanwhile we're the ones who are screwing everyone else. First we get them all going on &lt;i&gt;Let's Work Together to Solve Climate Change, &lt;/i&gt;then we pull out of the group that we formed to do it. We make peace with Iran, bring everyone else along, and then we pull out. Meanwhile our currency makes us rich, everyone has to do all their international business using dollars. But we elect representatives who threaten to deliberately crash the dollar. Why? Who the fuck knows. I doubt if they know. How would you sleep at night if you were an Asian banker knowing that you had to trust this crazy country. We complain a lot, but have no idea what we do to others. That goes 1 million times over for the richest Americans. But even those struggling to get by, this is all being done in our name. If we wanted to stop it we could, we just need the will.</description>

			<title>The soup of abuse</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My father was an alcoholic. He was a mean personal alcoholic. I think he learned it from his father. My mother was my father's enabler. She also was a victim of sexual abuse as a child. Her father was her abuser. She learned to be the enabler from her mother, who she hated. Her mother knew what her father was doing and was okay with it. As my mother knew what my father was doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My mother had a life, became a teacher and a school psychologist and ultimately a professor. I saw my mom in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Blasey_Ford&quot;&gt;Dr Ford&lt;/a&gt;, the mother I wish had. My mother never told her story. She couldn't talk about it. Only once, in the middle of the night, she called me, and told me a tiny bit of the story. It was like a confession. Before and after she refused to talk about it. I hope she talked about it with her therapist, but I don't know if she did. I have reasons to think she didn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I learned what happened by going to therapy myself, for eight years, in my forties. My personality formed as the inverse of my parents. They were the mold, I was the product. You could infer their abuse from my issues. I learned a lot about myself. I learned that it wasn't my fault that my childhood home wasn't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet&quot;&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave it to Beaver&lt;/a&gt;. My mom often implied that it was my fault. Kids are amazing at absorbing the judgment of adults.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I mention this as we start to discuss abuse more openly in our society. What I've wanted to say, I've ached to say, is that it's not an extraordinary event, it's the context within which we exist. We talk about abuse as if it was exceptional, but it's so much more. It's like talking about the game of chess by talking about chess pieces. Or a soup by looking at the peas, tomatoes, carrots. There's a gestalt. And that is still unmentionable. The abuse forms us. It gives us our issues. It creates problems that we have to overcome, or not. We each are assigned roles to play as children, it's hard to break out of the part you're given. To really get started healing, we have to pop up a level and look at our environment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I watched Kavanaugh this is what I saw. A person failing to maintain the pretense that he has had a wonderful life, when his life has been a horror show. He drinks to avoid looking. He is so much my father, I feel I know him, and while I loathed my father for most of my life, I eventually saw his struggle, one he never overcame, a child who was never accepted by his parents. It's no wonder he couldn't cope with being a father. Same with my mother. Again Dr Ford provided a perfect screen for me. She did what my mother never could do. My mother never got within 100 million miles of what Dr Ford did. She couldn't even talk about herself to her children, maybe not even to her therapist. She never made peace with her father and mother. And as a result never made peace with herself. She longed for love, for acceptance, for peace, she never attained it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think we're on the cusp of a huge revolution in humanity. Living in a soup of abuse and having to pretend everything is perfect, that's the world we're coming from. It's the only world we've known. At least I learned to tell myself the truth. That's progress. Now maybe we can get to a place where it's common to tell each other our truth. Then evolution can take off in a huge way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's a hopeful moment</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is the most hopeful moment in America since the election of 2016 and the initial revelations of #metoo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're getting close to talking about the real stuff, as a society. We haven't gotten there yet, but the testimony of both Dr Ford and Judge Kavanaugh represent truths never spoken so publicly before. Not even on Oprah. And it happened in the United States Senate, on TV, for everyone to see, everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So far we've only been talking about incidents, but abuse is more than that, it's the &lt;i&gt;context&lt;/i&gt; for our civilization. It's what we never talk about, publicly, and very rarely privately.  But there it was, through both of them, not just Ford. They both spoke their truth. Ford was more direct, but Kavanaugh was just as revealing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What he showed us is a last-ditch effort of a horror show he was trying to present as the pinnacle. He shouldn't worry about teaching at Harvard, coaching basketball or serving on the Supreme Court, he should worry about how he's going to tell the truth, not so much to us, but to himself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Like everyone else I've been bingeing on the Kavanaugh show, not on Netflix, but it should be. It's been an incredible story. If you need to catch up, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/podcasts/the-daily/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-hearing.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fthe-daily&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=podcasts&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&quot;&gt;today's Daily&lt;/a&gt; podcast. I was so exhausted last night I didn't watch any of the MSNBC shows.</description>

Can you imagine how Kavanaugh is blowing his top &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-judiciary-committee-postpones-kavanaugh-decision-friday-afternoon-n914676&quot;&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2. Who will play Kavanaugh on SNL tomorrow night?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;3. Do you wonder if they've invited Kavanaugh himself??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;4. What's the chance Kavanaugh withdraws before one week is up?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Great bike ride today, might be the last summer-weather ride of 2018. It's 82 and humid. It's a fluke for it to be this warm on Sept 26. There's nothing like a good workout to improve the spirits. It's chemical. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Continuing work on the new githubpub. One of the ideas I've been working towards is a similar kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;hierarchy&lt;/a&gt; in the repo as we had in the Frontier object database. I don't think it's practical to do the data gathering the website framework does as part of building a page. But there's a compromise, the idea of a default location. If I look for a template, for example, and don't find it in your database (i.e. repository), I then look in the system repo. It works. Not as cool as a completely hierarchic system, but two levels is better than one.</description>

If you're short on time, skip to the end and watch their honest commercial for Facebook. It's really good, funny, and thought provoking.</description>

			<description>I get it. News doesn't care who the news favors. You got a scoop, you run with it, let the chips fall where they may. But.. that applies to current events. Things that happen today or yesterday, or a few days ago. Remember the word &lt;i&gt;news&lt;/i&gt; comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=new&quot;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; which means something that just happened. Another requirement of news is that it be unusual. As they say, a plane landing on time might be new, but it isn't news. A plane crash, that would be news, if it happened recently. So if you report something that happened 1.5 years ago, and is as unremarkable as a plane landing on time, and it results in news being made, and your sources being gleefully ecstatic, that's not news, that's &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+cronyism&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=definition&quot;&gt;cronyism&lt;/a&gt;, and you're indicted for no longer being about news. I've had this concern about the NY Times for quite a few years, since they were instrumental in providing the false justification for the war in Iraq. Then there were Hillary's emails. Thanks for that. And the anonymous op-ed. And then the bullshit report about Rod Rosenstein saying 1.5 years ago something &lt;i&gt;we want him to say,&lt;/i&gt; like how do we dig out of this hole we're in? I don't know what to do about the NYT. I'd like to hear what they say about this. So far no reporter has asked them why they chose to run the story on Friday that's resulting in Rod Rosenstein's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1044239074851254272&quot;&gt;resignation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/09/rosenstein-resignation-would-be-disaster-for-the-rule-of-law.html&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;. And now what happens? Do you have any regrets NYT?</description>

			<source:outline text="I get it. News doesn't care who the news favors. You got a scoop, you run with it, let the chips fall where they may. But.. that applies to current events. Things that happen today or yesterday, or a few days ago. Remember the word &lt;i&gt;news&lt;/i&gt; comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=new&quot;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; which means something that just happened. Another requirement of news is that it be unusual. As they say, a plane landing on time might be new, but it isn't news. A plane crash, that would be news, if it happened recently. So if you report something that happened 1.5 years ago, and is as unremarkable as a plane landing on time, and it results in news being made, and your sources being gleefully ecstatic, that's not news, that's &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+cronyism&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=definition&quot;&gt;cronyism&lt;/a&gt;, and you're indicted for no longer being about news. I've had this concern about the NY Times for quite a few years, since they were instrumental in providing the false justification for the war in Iraq. Then there were Hillary's emails. Thanks for that. And the anonymous op-ed. And then the bullshit report about Rod Rosenstein saying 1.5 years ago something &lt;i&gt;we want him to say,&lt;/i&gt; like how do we dig out of this hole we're in? I don't know what to do about the NYT. I'd like to hear what they say about this. So far no reporter has asked them why they chose to run the story on Friday that's resulting in Rod Rosenstein's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1044239074851254272&quot;&gt;resignation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/09/rosenstein-resignation-would-be-disaster-for-the-rule-of-law.html&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;. And now what happens? Do you have any regrets NYT?" created="Mon, 24 Sep 2018 14:58:21 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/05/04/dorothy.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/09/24.html#a145821"/>

			<description>I want a user-owned browser. One that's free of the tech industry. Chrome was good when Firefox got slow and unfocused. And Firefox was good when MSIE was malware-infested and stagnant. But none of them were or are user-driven. We can't have a healthy web w/o a good browser.</description>

			<description>I don't see the point of polling for ordinary people. I get why political consultants and candidates would care. Even donors. But why should a voter care? I can't imagine ever making a decision on who to vote for based on poll results.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you could live in any time zone, as long as there was a major airport nearby, and you had certain requirements about weather, nearby universities, quality of bike riding, places to eat, real estate prices, or climate, even legal cannabis, politics (I can't live in a mostly-Republican place, I've tried).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The consultant would have a good idea about the markets in each geography, and was pretty good at listening. The things that make a good real estate agent, but without being tied to specific geography.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the advent of a global network, where you park yourself in physical space is more a matter of preference, it might not limit you in terms of employment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagine totally virtual companies might even provide this kind of service to their most valued people. &quot;I feel like living in the mountains for few years, starting in August, make it so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It would be great if we could make voting a party, a celebration, something to look forward to, not something you have to make time for. That would probably do more to improve the lives of all Americans than any other single thing. It's like the SuperBowl, the NBA Finals, Coachella or the Oscars, only better -- because &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are the stars.</description>

			<description>I'm rolling through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Maniac&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix and loving it. Jonah Hill, Emma Stone, Justin Theroux, Sally Field. Hill and Stone are incredible together. It's a bit of everything, The Matrix, Inception, Big Lebowski, Cloud Atlas, so many other things. I'm just starting episode 7 and rationing it. I don't want it to be over. It's the best thing in a long time.  Update: Other movies it borrows from -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind&quot;&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/a&gt;, Borat and The Graduate. Also Good Will Hunting. Best line: Gas up the Miata!</description>

			<description>At some point journalism has to look at the motives of journalists, because it’s material.

			<description>Wishlist item: I wish it were possible to write a driver for GitHub that would teach it how to display formats it doesn't know about, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. I write my development notes in OPML, and would like to have them be directly readable in GitHub. OPML has been stable for 18 years and RSS for 16. I think it would be safe to support them now. And this raises a question, can there be a process for vetting the code and adding it to the native capabilities of GitHub? I think most of the expertise in these formats exists outside their company. Are we ready for this kind of collaboration?</description>

			<description>Progress on my GitHub-as-CMS-database work. The concept it simple. Internet storage is a problem, there aren't many places to do it, where there are also interactive interfaces, and where you can store small amounts of stuff, personal stuff, for free, that has a chance of persisting into the future. Why do we need storage? When I want to write something, I need a place to store it. The stuff that the rendering for my blog is build from. All CMSes raise this question. There was an aha moment when I realized that GitHub's basic data structure, the repository, is similar to the basic data structure of Frontier, the object database. I wondered if some of the techniques we used for managing data in Frontier, the work that led to blogging, feed reading, podcasting, etc -- could work in GitHub. There are a lot of patterns that worked there, that might work here. I haven't gotten an answer yet, but I am learning, and getting data for more thought.</description>

			<description>I watched the 8-episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_(2018_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt; series on Amazon. I really liked it, totally worth watching. It's a love story, but anything beyond that would be a spoiler. Episode 6 is the oddball, it's totally standalone, you can watch it first if you want, it won't spoil anything. The two characters don't appear in any of the other episodes. It's an artistic flourish you see in shows like Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul, and in this case while the rest of the series is excellent, episode 6 is killer.</description>

			<source:outline text="I watched the 8-episode &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_(2018_TV_series)&quot;&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt; series on Amazon. I really liked it, totally worth watching. It's a love story, but anything beyond that would be a spoiler. Episode 6 is the oddball, it's totally standalone, you can watch it first if you want, it won't spoil anything. The two characters don't appear in any of the other episodes. It's an artistic flourish you see in shows like Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul, and in this case while the rest of the series is excellent, episode 6 is killer." created="Fri, 21 Sep 2018 02:29:05 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/09/20/forever.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/09/20.html#a022905"/>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/podcasts/the-daily/kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-caitlin-flanagan-sexual-assault.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is a must-listen. It's an interview with a woman who was sexually assaulted in high school. She talks about how depressed and suicidal she was after, but got relief when the assailant apologized in writing and in person. Being able to forgive is a vastly different situation from an attacker who denies. Provides a new perspective (for me) on the situation with Kavanaugh.</description>

			<title>Times are a changin</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember hearing on the NYT Daily podcast a couple of weeks ago that the Kavanaugh confirmation was locked in. Not even the slightest doubt. I objected, you never know what can happen. A sports fan would &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; say something like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's changing now is much bigger than one Supreme Court nomination, and I'm very aware of how significant one seat there is, esp this seat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're at peak Republican power, if the rest of us do it right. Repubs have optimized the flaws in the Constitution to enable the maximum concentration of wealth. PCs were instrumental, esp in gerrymandering. But the net works against the Repubs, because now people can organize, if we resist the automated methods that keep us disorganized.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time, a very good time, for the people to make their presence felt by the few senators needed to set back the Republican march. They just need to know we see them in this moment and are taking careful notes on what they do, right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And while you're watching the Senators, ignore the trolls. They are here to slow you down. Don't let them slow you down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why is our software so bloated? The problem is that when we get a consensus platform, so we can all focus our energies on optimizing, instead another platform gets invented, so we have to spread our resources paddling hard just to stay in place. It takes years and years to go from prototype to a well-oiled machine. In cars, how many years were there between Ford's Model A and Model T? What were they doing? Gratuitously changing indenting styles? Creating more hacks to try to solve callback hell by introducing fresh new hells? Or writing your docs in some arcane syntax built on top of the language everyone uses? We have 10000 times too many programmers for what we're getting done. Create limits. There are only so many MLB or NBA players. If there were fewer programmers we'd have to stop reinventing and try to be efficient. There's a math to this I'm sure of it.</description>

			<description>It's not well known that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; made a contribution to RSS 2.0, wrt the &amp;lt;cloud&gt; element. We were initially only supporting XML-RPC and SOAP protocols, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&quot;&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; suggested also supporting HTTP-POST. It was a good idea, and it came during the comment period for RSS 2.0, so it was possible to add it, so I did.</description>
