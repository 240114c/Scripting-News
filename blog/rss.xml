			<description>Good morning to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; braintrust! We're getting close to the darkest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. So the light has to come from inside of us, to make up for the outside light that isn't here. Spread the love. Give someone a hug. Especially yourself. Dave</description>

			<title>Welcoming writers to Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a longish rationale for why Twitter should open itself up to writers and developers of writing tools, but when the proposal was done, it came down to adding two elements to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started&quot;&gt;card metadata&lt;/a&gt;. So I thought, why bother with all the reasons, let's start with the answer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two elements are twitter:body and twitter:enclosure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:body&quot; content=&quot;Limited [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) can appear in the body of a card using the conventions of Markdown. You can **bolden** text, *italicize* it, break it into paragraphs, add anchor elements. It can be as long as you like.&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:enclosure&quot; content=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/14/whatINeedForNodeHosting.m4a&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it. And a couple of conventions for displaying the result, no more complex than viewing images or videos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Of course I posted this as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1206954535714996224&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, perfectly illustrating why Twitter needs this feature and has for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Long ago I made a &quot;long bet&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/longnow/status/1206613725005963264&quot;&gt;won&lt;/a&gt;. The bet was whether or not the NYT would continue to make their product freely available on the web. I figured no matter how much they tried, they would wall it off. They still haven't solved the problem. I think they could adopt the philosophy of open source tech billionaires. Make the product free and provide a supported version (whatever that means in news) for a price. This idea has been the foundation of all businesses ever started around software, because like news, there is no physical manifestation of our work, it's all in the arrangement of bits in computer memory. The biggest fortunes of our lifetimes have been made in commercializing those bits. Both hard to believe and true. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I generally do not update iTunes, iPhones or iPads unless I've bought a new Apple product that requires I do so. I am never updating Mac OS because I'm running the last version that runs the OPML Editor, which I use for mission-critical work. The only must-have feature Apple has introduced for Mac OS in the last 20 years is &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250&quot;&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt;. Everything else as far as I'm concerned is optional. Of course I will get spattered with email from people who couldn't live without X, Y or Z. I salute you in advance.</description>

			<description>That said I would &lt;i&gt;kill&lt;/i&gt; for a Linux version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;. Then I could just use that OS, the same one I run on my servers and that would significantly simplify life. I am willing to kick in money for the port. We've never figured out a way to do that, but I just wanted to put that out there. Ted Howard is managing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html&quot;&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; for the OPML Editor (it's a distro of UserLand Frontier). I am forever grateful for Ted for his work on this. It has made all my work much smoother.</description>

			<description>I have a box of backup disks from my career going back to the early 80s. I would like to start backing them up if I can. I think I have a CD drive that can read the backups from the 90s, but the earlier disks which are in various size floppy disks and Iomega disks will be more problematic. Starting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1206589087253176323&quot;&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; about how I want to approach this. My goal is to get the content of the disks up to Amazon S3 or something like that.</description>

			<title>Hover does it right</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to give the Web Architecture of the Decade award to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/&quot;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt;. They have a hidden feature that changes everything when managing domains, which is what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the feature. They let you put a CNAME where an A record is called for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words you can use a pointer where previously you could only use a hard-coded address. This makes it possible to switch hardware without having to keep track of every DNS-based reference to it. You can point through a pointer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's no reason not to do this. Their server is going to respond to every request, so they can do a database lookup to find out what IP address goes with the CNAME and return that.

			<title>Remembering 1999.io</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A number of years ago I set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;new app&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt; to run my blog. Interesting project, another look at the functionality of Manila, shipped in 1999, this time in the world of JavaScript and Node, with Facebook's UI as prior art. Last time I worked in this area Facebook didn't exist. Say what you want about them, their UI is innovative. Good ideas there. &quot;Only steal from the best,&quot; I say.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I feel 1999.io was and still is a significant improvement over what was there before, WordPress, Facebook, Tumblr, Ghost etc. Still works, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, I moved to another model, most like the one I used before Manila, based on an outliner, and have used it ever since. But of course I left the 1999.io site where it was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This isn't goodbye, 1999.io still runs, people still use it. Like a lot of things in a Twitter/Facebook dominated world, writing tools tend to languish on the sidelines. I still hope to change that, I have some ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A boomer's memory</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A commercial from the 60s or 70s that I only saw a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Camera slowly enters a beautiful office with a distinguished older man behind the desk. The announcer says &quot;And now a word from Guillermo Buitoni, president of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buitoni&quot;&gt;Buitoni&lt;/a&gt; Foods.&quot; Camera continues in for a close up, and stops. Pauses a couple of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He says: If you want me to like you...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another pause:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He says: Buy my pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Logo. Cut.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was perfect. No product shot. Just hey I'm this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe&quot;&gt;Master of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, and of course you want me to like you.

			<description>Are you kidding? Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss&quot;&gt;appropriated&lt;/a&gt; the small company's trademark -- Elastic? Please, NYT call at least one developer before you run a story like this, or do a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=amazon+elastic&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt;. This is super embarrassing -- for you. Here's the problem with the premise. Amazon has been calling their services Elastic this and that since inception. The first was &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/&quot;&gt;EC2&lt;/a&gt;. Elastic Compute Cloud. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2006/08/24.html#When:8:07:26AM&quot;&gt;started in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, six years before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_NV&quot;&gt;startup&lt;/a&gt; was founded. It seems to me, unless I'm missing something, that the startup copied Amazon.</description>

A big folder with lots of sub-folders, each of which is an app -- containing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodesource.com/blog/the-basics-of-package-json-in-node-js-and-npm/&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/a&gt; file, a node_modules folder, all code, data. You figure out how to host them on servers, I don't care. It works like Dropbox, keeps the folders in sync with the running apps it's managing.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/btaylor&quot;&gt;Bret Taylor&lt;/a&gt; is the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/1205262855861235713&quot;&gt;COO&lt;/a&gt; of Salesforce. This is notable because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor&quot;&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1205509575862083591&quot;&gt;real developer&lt;/a&gt;. He led the development of Google Maps, then started FriendFeed, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+FriendFeed&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;we used&lt;/a&gt;. It was acquired by Facebook where he became CTO and FriendFeed became the user interface of Facebook, the one we use today. He's created a lot of products, all excellent, timely and hugely popular. Having him lead a company like Salesforce is unusual, perhaps even unprecedented. A lot of tech CEOs have product backgrounds, but none as deep as Taylor. Salesforce also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, which is as far as I know unique and under-used. A simple way of hosting Node apps. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;used it&lt;/a&gt; for a few years myself, until it became &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/05/12/whyIMovedOffHeroku.html&quot;&gt;uneconomical&lt;/a&gt;. If they were aggressive with it and invested, they could challenge Amazon and Google in hosting. Maybe they already do. Taylor has the depth and background to do some very consequential stuff at Salesforce. We'll be watching. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This is notable because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor&quot;&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1205509575862083591&quot;&gt;real developer&lt;/a&gt;. He led the development of Google Maps, then started FriendFeed, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+FriendFeed&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;we used&lt;/a&gt;. It was acquired by Facebook where he became CTO and FriendFeed became the user interface of Facebook, the one we use today. He's created a lot of products, all excellent, timely and hugely popular. Having him lead a company like Salesforce is unusual, perhaps even unprecedented. A lot of tech CEOs have product backgrounds, but none as deep as Taylor. Salesforce also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, which is as far as I know unique and under-used. A simple way of hosting Node apps. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;used it&lt;/a&gt; for a few years myself, until it became &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/05/12/whyIMovedOffHeroku.html&quot;&gt;uneconomical&lt;/a&gt;. If they were aggressive with it and invested, they could challenge Amazon and Google in hosting. Maybe they already do. Taylor has the depth and background to do some very consequential stuff at Salesforce. We'll be watching. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 14 Dec 2019 15:10:01 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/12/14.html#a151001"/>

			<description>One thing Facebook could do is provide a clean URL to point into Facebook, without any spyware, so FB posts can be part of the open web. A link into Facebook should be a safe thing. They're always saying how they want to make the web safer. So this has a double benefit. Help the web, and keep people safe.</description>

			<title>Right wing nut jobs of Nashville</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At a BloggerCon-like conference in Nashville. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/05/07.html&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. My session was occupied by a small number of right wing Rush Limbaugh fans. All men, as you might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were complaining no one was listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was the moderator. I pointed out to the nth guy to complain -- you know everyone is listening to you right now. Didn't matter, someone else started complaining about the same thing. They just kept saying the same words over and over. As today, their main point was their grievance.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My response was this: &quot;I can't tell you why there aren't more right wing nut jobs here, best I can do is listen and empathize and then move on to the next person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The former United States</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you think of the United States as a company, we've had a strategic partnership with Russia for the last three years, kind of like the one Microsoft had with IBM. Russia is analogous to Microsoft. They're about to roll over us in the 2020 election. Our last gasp is the impeachment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should have had this confrontation sooner, we would have had a better chance of prevailing. Going back to the Electoral College vote in 2016. We could have briefed the electors on the misdeeds of the Trump campaign in collusion with Russia. We could have had nightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/16/december19IsABigDay.html&quot;&gt;candlelight vigils&lt;/a&gt; in the state capitals where the electoral votes would be cast. We could have at least honored the passing of a political system that kind of worked and provided us with an incredible standard of living, and hosted the development of the Internet, won the space race, and Woodstock and the Mets! Saved my family. I wouldn't exist without the US and probably neither would you. We could have been serious about resisting right from that point, instead as with all the points at which we could have acted, we hoped somehow this would blow over without us having to disrupt our lives. We're a lazy, fat culture, Russia knows and is taking full advantage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway back to the tech analogy. Impeachment is like IBM shipping OS/2 and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=micro+channel+architecture&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Micro Channel Architecture&lt;/a&gt;. Both were designed to rid IBM of Microsoft once and for all. But it didn't work. It was too little too late. Microsoft came out with Windows 3.0, and IBM became a global consulting company. The company that dominated the computer business left the computer business. With the US and Russia analogy substitute &quot;computer business&quot; with &quot;democracy business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Impeachment is the last gasp bet that the rule of law still works, even though the Supreme Court has been stuffed with Russian puppets, as has the Senate. The only places that are still following the rule of law is the House and parts of the Department of Justice. Think of it as a two party system about to become one party. The one that prevails in impeachment will have the right to anihilate the other, and must do it.  There may still be a few courageous defectors to the Rule-of-Law Party, but unless there's a great awakening in the Senate, the courts, DoJ, the military and other branches of service, Putin has the power to put down impeachment, and from there, will complete the replication of the political system of Russia in the US, where political opponents are jailed or assassinated, as with uncooperative journalists. This is about to happen in the US, but journalism and discourse on the net has yet to catch up.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Putin could really fuck with us (but probably won't), and instruct McConnell to have a change of heart and the Senate votes to remove Trump. What an opportunity to screw up the US for a few generations, if not longer. From this point we're never going to know what's actually going on, we don't really know now (btw), but it's going to get a lot worse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wheeee!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've had a chance to think more about Twitter's surprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; to come up with a web standard that turns Twitter into a protocol. I'm guessing the practical reason for this is so that Twitter can no longer be held responsible for abuse. They could ask Trump, for example, to host his own twitter, and people could subscribe to it anywhere, including Jack's twitter. It's basically a return to the open web after 13 years as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo&quot;&gt;silo&lt;/a&gt; that's been sucking the life out of the open web. I don't see why anyone but Twitter and its shareholders would go for this. I am still hoping Twitter, for the good of the web and the world, would expand to attach and display data from blogging software, as they attach and display video and images. That way writing beyond 280 chars with titles, links, simple styling can flourish. Same with podcasts. Twitter improves at a glacial pace, and they're hogging the fast lane of web media, of course along wtih the other silos.</description>

			<source:outline text="I've had a chance to think more about Twitter's surprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; to come up with a web standard that turns Twitter into a protocol. I'm guessing the practical reason for this is so that Twitter can no longer be held responsible for abuse. They could ask Trump, for example, to host his own twitter, and people could subscribe to it anywhere, including Jack's twitter. It's basically a return to the open web after 13 years as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo&quot;&gt;silo&lt;/a&gt; that's been sucking the life out of the open web. I don't see why anyone but Twitter and its shareholders would go for this. I am still hoping Twitter, for the good of the web and the world, would expand to attach and display data from blogging software, as they attach and display video and images.

			<description>Note: If Twitter really wanted to help they could make it unnecessary to paste images of blog posts in tweets (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1205126525391122433&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;). Such an obvious thing. What could possibly stand in the way of doing this, when they do it for images and videos?</description>

			<description>Follow-up: Now that (I think) I understand Twitter's goal, what they really want is a way to have a feed be hooked into a Twitter &quot;location.&quot; So one could follow, for example:  @whitehouse.gov:donaldtrump, and it would get updates from that server. &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; would totally be able to do it.</description>

			<description>I wonder how many people know that Facebook turned off its most basic API after the 2016 election. Got no press, there's no developer memory of it. It's as if all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_crossings_of_the_Hudson_River&quot;&gt;Hudson crossings&lt;/a&gt; to NYC were shut down permanently, only bigger because the population of Facebook is billions not millions. Twitter on the other hand shut down a portion of its APIs in 2012 and it put an indelible mark on the reputation of the company with developers. I personally forgave them because I anticipated it, I've been down this road many times, on both sides.</description>

			<description>It pisses me off when Repubs talk about the Dems trying to redo the election they lost. I forgot about the voter suppression, &quot;her emails&quot; and Comey's last minute surprise, and realized no, she won the election, you guys stole it. The gall of Trump to try to make a lie stick, that &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; was the victim of all that.</description>

			<description>Lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/12.html&quot;&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; relating to the question Twitter asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/11.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. To people who are new to my world, this is a big deal. We'll probably be talking about it for years, assuming we make it (not so sure after watching the House hearings). But other stuff is going on, I'll put those links here, thinking of the email going out tonight, which more and more is the pulse of my blogging.

			<title>What about Mastodon?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So, what about Mastodon? It does everything, right? I'm sure, but Twitter is where the people are and that's what matters. This happens all the time in tech, people think the solution is to rebuild something from scratch with the feature we wish the default platform would have. It isn't about the feature as much as where the feature is. I have a blogging system that's way more fun that Twitter and has none of its limits. BFD, the people use Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the mistake people who created Atom made, they thought what if we had invented RSS instead of the messy process by which RSS was created, we'll do it the right way and it'll be wonderful. Then they finished and no one knew what to do next. I'm sure they were very proud but unless they can get everyone who already supported RSS to go back and reimplement their support, we all still have to support RSS. And it's one of those things that no matter how much better it is, people will ask &quot;Is everyone doing this&quot; and if the answer is no, they do something else they have to do, putting out fires etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another example, if I have to go to NYC I take the George Washington Bridge or the Holland or Lincoln Tunnels. I'd much rather take the Golden Gate Bridge, it's so much nicer, but it doesn't go where I want to go! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106&quot;&gt;outlines&lt;/a&gt; a plan to fund a small independent team to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media, a standard that Twitter would support. I advocate something different, Twitter already has the bugs and scaling issues solved for a global notification network. Let's add a few APIs and create a new universe. It'll happen a lot faster with much better results imho. Interestingly I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/03.html#a151621&quot;&gt;podcast on just this topic&lt;/a&gt;, a week ago today.</description>

			<description>I've been down the road Jack proposes to take Twitter down, it's fraught with problems. Social media has been around a long time and there are plenty of competing standards for integrating platforms. Had they proposed such a standard when they were starting Twitter, no one would have cared, and it would have had a chance of working. Now it's a huge industry with lots at stake and lots of entities that would like to keep it from standardizing. Now maybe Jack knows this, and it's meant as a PR thing, and I'm sure the press will love it. Until they forget about it. It's time for a &lt;i&gt;proprietary&lt;/i&gt; approach, one that is open to cloning. That can work because there's a single decision-making entity. If their goal really is to create a standard they can do it, much the way we created standards for content syndication when our product dominated. Waiting for an open development group to synthesize something that can be broadly supported, well I suppose it could happen, but it rarely does.</description>
