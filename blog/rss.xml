			<title>The Democratic platform</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One word: Oversight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Details&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The courts are doing their job, as are the juries (so far).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The DOJ is doing their job.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Journalism is doing the best they can, given that Mueller doesn't leak and Congress doesn't do oversight. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are lots of questions about the president's behavior. Perhaps his most vocal supporters won't agree, but most Americans support the Mueller investigation, and that includes Republicans. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every branch of government is working, except one. Congress.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No Congressional oversight. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's a way to fix that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Elect Democrats to Congress.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Impeachment is a distraction&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All that impeachment means is the president is indicted. Then he has to be tried and convicted before he is removed. Impeachment is easy, and relatively meaningless.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Unless the Senate votes by a 2/3 majority to convict, nothing happens. It won't matter to Trump. It'll just give him a way of dominating discourse for another six months, and in the end he will still be president. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Unless the people overwhelmingly want him removed, then he will be removed. And we aren't there now, so there's no point impeaching. So take it off the table. We have more important work to do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you look at how things are set up in the Constitution, and our experience with removing a president from office, you must have overwhelming support from the people in order for it to happen. Impeachment wihtout removal is only symbolic. Republicans have to fear they will not get re-elected with Trump as president. 2/3 of the Senate has to vote to remove. That will include a lot of senators from Republican states. So at this point, removal is an impossible dream. It can't happen until thej people want it to happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic platform&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Elect a majority in either house and the Democrats will provide the missing oversight.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Deprive them of flow, they shrivel up and die. People who RT him are undermining our future. Unfollow without a second thought.

			<title>First Amendment is more than law</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a big disconnect about what the First Amendment is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As a law it applies to the relationship between the govt and citizens. But it’s more than a law, it represents a basic American  value. We believe that speech is a right and must be protected.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when in doubt a company should protect the speech of its employees and customers. Not must but should. Esp if it wants us to see it as American. I should be able to keep my job even if I have opinions that are different from my employer, if it doesn’t affect my ability to do my job.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you try to get someone fired because you don’t like their opinion, you may be entitled to do that, but you are being intolerant and un-American. You should support everyone’s right to express their ideas. You don’t have to, but you should, if you want to be an American.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Puzzling Mac download behavior</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On the Frontier-User list, Frank Meeuwsen &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/frontier-user/i13XoQ6Rq_I&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; a problem using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/#1506805469000&quot;&gt;DMG&lt;/a&gt; that installs the OPML Editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He downloads the DMG, extracts the OPML folder, runs the app, and gets a dialog asking where the root is. You're not supposed to get this dialog. OPML.app is supposed to look for and automatically open opml.root in the same folder as the app. This isn't happening.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have been able to reproduce it here. To try to narrow down the problem, I created a virgin OPML folder, zipped it, copied it to another folder, unzipped it, ran the app and it worked as it's supposed to. I then uploaded the zipped file, downloaded it, unzipped as before, ran the app, and got the behavior Frank describes. If you want to try it, you can download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/39lkdbd5cu2kc5e/OPML.zip?dl=1&quot;&gt;zip file&lt;/a&gt; from my Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a script to compare the original zip file with the downloaded file. They are identical. Something is happening when the zip file is uncompressed? Not sure. I don't have the ability to look inside the OPML app to see what's tripping it up. This is new behavior. I am having trouble coming up with theories to try. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/93&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for this issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: Ted Howard &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tedchoward/Frontier/issues/9&quot;&gt;solved&lt;/a&gt; this problem in April. Issue closed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I kept it running for twelve years, hoping the NYT would get the idea, and do it for itself, or even better, let me do it for them. Earlier today I got a letter from an in-house lawyer at the Times. It's a nice letter, given that a lawyer wrote it. But after all these years of being ignored, the first response is from a lawyer? That's not only rude, it's sad. So I decided the best thing to do is turn the site off. I don't feel like paying a lawyer to represent me when I'm just doing this project because I want the NYT to do better by its readers. If they decide to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch&quot;&gt;say thanks&lt;/a&gt;, or even maybe buy me lunch, I'll consider turning it back on. ✓</description>

			<description>John McCain's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/misc/mcCainFarewell.md&quot;&gt;farewell statement&lt;/a&gt;. This is probably why Trump doesn't want the flag flying at half staff over the White House. BTW, I couldn't find a canonical copy of McCain's statement. So I thought where should I put a copy to point to where it might have a chance of surviving for a while. I chose GitHub. But we still don't have a good &quot;for-the-record&quot; place on the web, imho.</description>

			<description>David Johnson on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheDavidJohnson/status/1034105691689107457&quot;&gt;wonders&lt;/a&gt; what's the diff betw &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;. That's an interesting question that never occurred to me, because they are so disjoint in time. The OPML Editor is derived from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, which is an outliner among many other things. But the OPML Editor does present as an outliner. One that lives inside a very powerful scripting environment, server and object database, all integrated, and evolved over a couple of decades. It's like the cellphone on the dashboard of a 747. However at this time, the power of the scripting environment would be wasted on an outliner user, most of the additions have fallen into disuse. That said, LO2 is a clone of the outliner inside OPML Editor, which was a clone of MORE, Ready and going way back to ThinkTank which first shipped in 1983. The long and winding road of Dave's outliners.</description>

			<source:outline text="David Johnson on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheDavidJohnson/status/1034105691689107457&quot;&gt;wonders&lt;/a&gt; what's the diff betw &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;. That's an interesting question that never occurred to me, because they are so disjoint in time. The OPML Editor is derived from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, which is an outliner among many other things. But the OPML Editor does present as an outliner. One that lives inside a very powerful scripting environment, server and object database, all integrated, and evolved over a couple of decades. It's like the cellphone on the dashboard of a 747. However at this time, the power of the scripting environment would be wasted on an outliner user, most of the additions have fallen into disuse. That said, LO2 is a clone of the outliner inside OPML Editor, which was a clone of MORE, Ready and going way back to ThinkTank which first shipped in 1983. The long and winding road of Dave's outliners." created="Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:48:57 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/08/27/scientist.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2018/08/27.html#a164857"/>

			<description>More on inclusivity, which I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/26/161533.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/27/nerdsAndHippies.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 about how boys interpret the demonizing of men. It's very much related to the idea of being inclusive. If we're fighting for respect and justice there can't be any limits on who is entitled to it.</description>

			<description>I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science&quot;&gt;Bronx Science&lt;/a&gt;, one of two special high schools in NYC that you have to take a test to get into. I took the test when I was in 9th grade, in the late 60s. The NYT recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/nyregion/shsat-new-york-city-schools.html&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; five questions from the test. I got four of five right. The one I got wrong was controversial. They have a discussion in the Times article why no one agrees on the correct answer. I was befuddled by it too, it was the one I got wrong. I was especially pleased to have gotten the geometry question right, because I haven't thought about geometry once since I left high school. Not a whole lot of geometry in software development work, or even in a math degree.</description>

			<description>I've decided to get involved on Instagram. My name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/davew/&quot;&gt;davew&lt;/a&gt; there. It's weird they don't let you post pictures from the desktop web browser. You have to go into the JS debugger and tell it to emulate a phone browser. Then you can upload an image.</description>

			<description>I'm also going to start using &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/about&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. I see they call their posts toots. I'm sorry but that makes me think of farts. If they'd have asked me I'd have said to call them grunts or snorts. After all I can't imagine a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon&quot;&gt;mastodon&lt;/a&gt; tooting. That's the kind of thing a monkey might do. BTW, little known fact, my handle on CompuServe back in the 80s was Mastodon. PS: I absolutely despise dark backgrounds. Hurts my eyes. I can only read dark text on light backgrounds.</description>

			<description>Ever since Facebook turned off the API, doing something new with &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlecardeditor.com/&quot;&gt;Little Card Editor&lt;/a&gt; has been on my todo list. One thing I wanted to be able to do is include a card in my blog, the same way I include a tweet. I thought I'd have to factor out the card renderer in the app, so I could call it from my blog renderer, but there's a much dumber and simpler approach, just include the image of the card as it appears in Twitter. It works. As you can see in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/26.html#a160926&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. So I am able to do that now. Bingo. ✓</description>

			<title>Inclusivity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What it means to be inclusive&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don’t care how you got to the party. Whether you took the subway, walked, came by spaceship or were driven by your chauffeur. What’s important is you’re here.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Non-inclusive vs inclusive&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can advocate for your cause by pushing away people who you don't identify with, or you can be inclusive, and take support where you get it. Most of the great causes we remember are the inclusive kind. The ones that demonize or ridicule &quot;others&quot; tend to result in war.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two views of America&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Constitution is inclusive. It started out with some huge holes. Over the generations we've been closing them. That's been the clear trend.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Trump movement is non-inclusive. It says there are &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; Americans, white, rural, Christian, male-dominated. They say these are traditional American values. This isn't new, this thread has been a constant since the beginning. It's the regulator on change happening too fast.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One of the reasons the Trump style America is ascendant is that the inclusive America has been moving forward at a rapid pace in the last few generations, post-World War II. Recently, we had an African-American president, the ultimate in other-ness, and we have removed gender from the concept of marriage. That's a lot of change happening very quickly, &lt;i&gt;within ten years. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To heal we have to come out the other side with our inclusive principles intact.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I want a bank/brokerage website that has an easy UI. I don't care about commissions. My auto insurance company website is fast and easy. This builds trust, believe it or not. Nothing is worse than a bank that can't run a proper website. It's 2018, some bank should excel by now.</description>

			<description>What I hate most about Chrome's &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;NOT SECURE&lt;/font&gt; message is that this is all they could think of to say about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my wonderful blog&lt;/a&gt;. A blog that predates Google itself by four years. It's got humor and sadness, fun and tech tips. Yet all they can say is yuck we don't like this site. We welcomed Google. Even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/01/10.html#yupTheUsersCared&quot;&gt;loved&lt;/a&gt; them. And this is what's become of them. Heartless and soulless. Bullies. No love.</description>

A blog that predates Google itself by four years. It's got humor and sadness, fun and tech tips. Yet all they can say is yuck we don't like this site. We welcomed Google. Even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/01/10.html#yupTheUsersCared&quot;&gt;loved&lt;/a&gt; them. And this is what's become of them. Heartless and soulless. Bullies.

			<description>There's a new brand of bike sharing in NYC now. Yesterday I saw two bright red bikes, shaped like a Lime bike or CitiBike, with a plastic basket up front. Didn't have time to read the logo/branding. Both in Manhattan. Andy DeSoto &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kadesoto/status/1033354917656911872&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; they're Jump bikes. And guess what, they say on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jumpbikes.com/cities/new-york-city/&quot;&gt;their site&lt;/a&gt; they're available now in NYC. (But only in Staten Island and Westchester.)</description>

			<description>I've been saying this for &lt;i&gt;decades.&lt;/i&gt; Every brand should have an iconic image that bloggers can crib. What that means is this -- a product shot on a white or transparent background. Large enough for large product shots, and for right margin images, we can make them smaller. I wanted to put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jumpbikes.com/&quot;&gt;Jump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jumpbikes&quot;&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt; in the right margin, but when I do an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;biw=1383&amp;bih=1186&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=4mSBW9uWH8mc_Qa7r4vYBw&amp;q=jump+bike+share+red&amp;oq=jump+bike+share+red&amp;gs_l=img.3...7026.8128.0.8463.6.6.0.0.0.0.151.585.3j3.6.0....0...1c.1.64.img..2.1.67...0i24k1.0.pDhlh-JQAjE&quot;&gt;image search&lt;/a&gt;, all I see are bikes being ridden or parked with lots of not-easily cropped backgrounds.

			<description>I have a friend who's an accomplished computer scientist, really smart and creative in that area. Also a good teacher. But in politics he's a snotty bastard, he uses logic that could never work in debugging code. I wonder how such contradictions happen? Really puzzling.</description>

			<title>Facebook is broken, part #3929</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I visit the site, I get the same top message. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I go to the popup menu to say &quot;Don't show me this again&quot; they start me down the abusive-user path. Why do I want to block this user. I don't. What did they do? Nothing, you fucked up FB. So I skip it, and every time I come here I see the same damn image, a movie about cilantro.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like cilantro, but it isn't the center of my existence. Facebook, we can move on from this. You have a bug. Give me a way to say stop showing me this message and the user is doing nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;By lacking a way to tell you this, you're compounding the insult of the bug. &lt;i&gt;Your&lt;/i&gt; bug. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Some people don't seem to mind if you know they're mean or corrupt. I've had this experience a few times. I guess they feel I can't do them any harm, so why not share their depravity? Funny thing is, eventually they all come to care that I knew. One of the mysteries of life. Our dear president appears to be one of those people, on a grand scale. And his chickens may be coming home to roost.</description>

			<description>A NYC story you won't read on the op-ed page of the NYT. I'm in the fucking bike line, a cab is waiting, adjacent to the lane, for I don't know what, and just as I approach he starts to move across the lane. I yell five times WATCH OUT and he stops, and as I pass, I make eye contact and yell FUCK YOU BIKE LANE. In Madison or Palo Alto you'd say Yo how you doing, but in NYC the salutation is FUCK YOU. Everyone understands this except people visiting from Madison or Palo Alto of course. It's why I like NY so much. Fuck you, let's dispense with the niceties. He was probably a Yankees fan anyway.</description>

			<description>I know this is impractical, but if we wanted a more rational government we would only allow people who serve on juries to vote. It's an education in civic responsibility like no other.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I was automatically upgraded to the new version of Gmail in the browser. The only new feature that I can see is that there's a really stupid animation that makes me wait for Gmail's UI to show up. Mail is a very integral part of my work flow. If anything they should make it load &lt;i&gt;faster. &lt;/i&gt;Making the load slower is imho inexplicable and indefensible. Another beautiful feature, where the star used to appear is now a trash icon. I just deleted a message I wanted to star. Oh that really makes sense. (Sarcasm.) Now an adventure to figure out where the fuck they put deleted messages so I can undelete it. It was important (which is why I was trying to star it).</description>

			<description>I think a lot of newbie software designers don't get that their users incorporate the quirks of their products at the base of the spine, i.e. beyond conscious thought. I think &quot;star this mofo&quot; and my spine tells my fingers to do it. My mind forgets the process. Breaking this connection immediately makes you think about things you normally do automatically. When I write my book there will be a whole chapter on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/01/04/burningBrainCells.html&quot;&gt;Burning Brain Cells&lt;/a&gt; which is what I call this phenomenon.</description>

			<description>The last couple of days I did a bunch of farting around with programmatic access to GitHub via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolNightly/blob/master/oldschoolnightly.js&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt;. I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/READMEx.md&quot;&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt; that said it was done with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/english/&quot;&gt;English editor&lt;/a&gt;, a project I vaguely remembered. I did a little digging and found the software and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/48&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I wrote documenting the work. The idea is to use GitHub as a blogging database. So what I did was get an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;Medium-Editor&lt;/a&gt; to edit stuff on GitHub. Couple that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/githubpub&quot;&gt;GitHubPub&lt;/a&gt; that maps subdomains on locations within GitHub repos, and you've got a nice dynamic blogging system with almost $0 hosting costs. Oh if only I had the time to chase down all these &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_Rabbit_Hole&quot;&gt;rabbit holes&lt;/a&gt;. 🐇</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolNightly/blob/master/oldschoolnightly.js&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that backs up a bunch of files from my blog onto a GitHub repository every night. So in case my servers ever go offline, there's another copy of the content, kept current automatically, on GitHub. It's good starter code for your own backup app. I rewrote it in the last couple of days to also back up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/misc/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/rss.xml&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/podcatch/subscriptions.opml&quot;&gt;files&lt;/a&gt; that were being copied by another process running in Frontier.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/08/20/end-era-old-harvard-blogging-site&quot;&gt;Inside Higher Ed&lt;/a&gt; has a story about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/15/141004.html&quot;&gt;Berkman blogs&lt;/a&gt;. They raise the right issues. Can't we do better than just throwing away archives, esp from a project that yielded such good results. I'm also not sure what Berkman meant about the blogs being antiquated. They seem to be saying people would be better off writing on Facebook or Twitter. Blogs have significant advantages over writing for social networks. There are tradeoffs. Perhaps the server software hasn't been updated. That could be a problem. We can help with the decisions Harvard is making. But there has to be communication first.</description>

			<description>On the Mac we had a phonebook size doc called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Macintosh&quot;&gt;Inside Macintosh&lt;/a&gt;. It was divided into toolkits, which were analogous to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages&quot;&gt;packages&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of each chapter was the theory, tightly written and edited. You might have to read a couple of times before grokking. Then all the calls you could make against the objects. As a result devs not only understood how to program the platform, but also understood the theory. I realize now that we are missing the equivalent doc for the web. Of course it wouldn't be printed. As a result you fumble around in the dark on a lot of stuff, not really understanding why things are the way they are, what the designers were thinking, and then years later it dawns on you. It's not too late imho to fill in this missing piece.</description>

			<description>Thinking about where I am in re a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/21.html#a144138&quot;&gt;Linux version&lt;/a&gt; of Frontier. I just realized that my collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;GitHub projects&lt;/a&gt; amount to the built-in verb set of Frontier. There are big missing pieces, and they aren't tied together in an object database, but the functionality is there. I am often reminded of this, when writing a utility script that would take minutes in Frontier, and I'm already on Day Two in JavaScript.  For example, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/master/daveutils.js&quot;&gt;JS code&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveutils&quot;&gt;daveutils&lt;/a&gt; package. I even use the same names as in Frontier, but without the Frontier syntax.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've completely had it with people who RT the troller-in-chief.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you RT him you shine the light on him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It makes no difference to the troll whether you like or dislike.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You're feeding the troll either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trolls are solar-powered. Trolls die in darkness. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am fed up with supposed members of The Resistance who RT the troll. You are every bit as bad as Fox News. If people stopped RTing him now, he'd lose his power. You can help by shaming people who RT him, no matter what their stated intention. I'm going a step further and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1032293670161211393&quot;&gt;namechecking&lt;/a&gt; them as I unfollow. Help bring notoriety to the troll-feeders. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Zero tolerance for Trump RTers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For more info see my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;FAQ on trolling&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trolls die in darkness. And that's a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: With apologies to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-washington-posts-new-slogan-turns-out-to-be-an-old-saying/2017/02/23/cb199cda-fa02-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Wes Felter&lt;/a&gt; last night about a project I want to do. I want to get Frontier running more or less as-is on Linux. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22wes+felter%22&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=twitter&quot;&gt;Wes&lt;/a&gt; was an early &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+wes+felter&amp;t=hj&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;UserLander&lt;/a&gt;, he got us started with Frontier as an HTTP server. He understood the product at the time in ways I didn't. What came from that? &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;website framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software#Manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; and lots of other stuff. We talked about how to get the project done, and he suggested doing video demos of the things that make Frontier unique. It's a really good idea. And kind of daunting. I'm thinking about how to get started. I think the first step is to think of a project I can do in steps, that touches on most aspects of the environment. Maybe a web site for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22bull+mancuso%22&amp;t=hi&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Bull Mancuso&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://kim.smallpict.com/&quot;&gt;Kim Parker&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloatware.org/&quot;&gt;Bloatware&lt;/a&gt; (two not-so-famous fake people I use for demos and docs). It would be more interesting if it turned out to be something useful that made sense to deploy in Frontier. I wouldn't mind setting up a server on Amazon running Windows just to get the app up and running. And then getting that app running in Frontier on Linux would be the home run.</description>
