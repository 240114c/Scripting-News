			<description>To Woodstock readers, a couple of ideas. 1. Eventually imho it would be cool if someone did what I'm doing but focused on the town and county. 2. I'm thinking of hosting a meetup, perhaps in my living room, where we do this face to face. I talk for a few minutes on topics either from the blog (most likely) or other subjects. I have done this before, in California and Boston, it can be really interesting. Kind of a like a book club for something that's ongoing, not finished. Or a book tour that lasts months. Just a couple of ideas, seeds planted for the future. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸŒ²&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A blogging meta-note. I use my blog-writing as a break from development work. Ideas occur to me while doing other stuff. I use the blog as a notebook to record them. I also use Twitter as a first draft. As I've said before the 280-char limit made Twitter a lot more useful. I have a graphic editing environment for blogging that only runs on a Mac. When an idea occurs to me when I'm away from work, I can use a phone or tablet to record it on Twitter. It's there when I'm back at my Mac. It's a pretty decent editorial system. I sent a DM yesterday to Jack Dorsey asking to work on the integration of Twitter with desktop writing tools (my own in particular of course). I think it's so close toa breakthrough. I can feel it. I've been right about this before, btw. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¡&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Changes in our world are happening so fast. I wish more news orgs took this as an opportunity to teach and reinforce American rules of self-governance. (British too, btw.) They matter now. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+jury+duty&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;jury duty&lt;/a&gt;. You'd be amazed at what random Americans can do. We are capable of understanding a lot, with nuance. Look at the rules of any sport, baseball, football, etc. Very complicated. Yet huge numbers of people understand them. And we have a baseline of truth in sports talk. People don't make up averages or rules, yet there's lots of room for subjective opinion. In some countries sports talk does turn violent, but not in the US. Wouldn't be a bad model for a new news org to adopt, up front. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;âŒš&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/sports/basketball/curry-zion-nba-injuries.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rss&quot;&gt;NYT says&lt;/a&gt; the NBA is not much fun now. I get it. I tried watching the Nets v Rockets last night. Preferred the Knicks v Celtics. The Knicks are more interesting this year. A mix of young and old. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Barrett&quot;&gt;sensational rookie&lt;/a&gt;. The boring part of the NBA are the corporate players like Kyrie and KD. Mercenaries. Oh we'll occupy the Nets so we can take cheap shots at the Knicks. Wow. Brilliant. No one cares about the Nets. They get their paycheck and they'll move on to humiliate another team next year, until fans get tired of it. Thing is most of the fans already are. Ask Toronto. You know the players must think we don't know it's about teams. We really don't care about them so much. Make good teams and we'll be happy. That's why we like the Celtics, the Bucks, Philly, and guess what the Knicks look okay this year. Someone put some care into creating this team. I think that's what the Knicks have been missing. Someone who cares about them. But the Knicks would've said yes to Kyrie, I'm glad they didn't get the chance.</description>

			<description>By now everyone whoâ€™s an actual person on Twitter should get that the extreme opinions there are programmed by software. These imitation people are algorithmic, not human. In other words we are being programmed by other peopleâ€™s programs. All you have to do is not get sucked into the emotional &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord&quot;&gt;smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord&lt;/a&gt; the algorithms try to induce in you.</description>

			<description>We're erecting a Maginot Line, getting ready to re-fight the Battle of 2016, ignoring that the enemy already controls our capital. We should be &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/02/134152.html&quot;&gt;innovating&lt;/a&gt;, but we're not. We're defending against Nixon with lots of Woodsteins.

			<title>Innovating in journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You know the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs ad&lt;/a&gt; about how geniuses think differently. He was on to something. There is a big difference between the way innovators think and everyone else. And I think I can finally put the difference in words.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're going to innovate you do it first, and look for funding when you've got something working. You don't wait for anyone's approval, or investors nagging you about when you're going to finish, because if your idea is innovative enough you'll never be able to explain it in words, and you'll learn so much in the process, the idea will sound very different very quickly if it's new enough. People will want to invest when it's up and running. You have to get there first. The innovator goes ahead. The non-innovator doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have several friends who are former journalists who are so driven by what they do they write publicly, even though no one is paying them. What they do is exciting. Their ideas are different and valuable. They get me, their reader, thinking, which imho is the best kind of journalism. They may not know it but they are innovating, and if they keep at it, I think there's a good chance they will have such obvious success that people will want to invest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would invest myself if we could put it together as something investible. By that I mean it has a way to grow. That it's not just investing in a few outside-the-box thinkers, but if it could become a place where such thinkers could start, follow their idea, develop their own following, and inspire other thinkers to do what they do. I wouldn't burden it with advertising. I'd let it run for a while, the way they let software developers run without a business model these days, while they test their ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just thinking out loud here. I am sure there's a new journalism out there, that it's not the journalism that gets so much acclaim, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/12/woodward-bernstein-watergate-donald-trump-era&quot;&gt;reinvention&lt;/a&gt; of Woodward and Bernstein, the two Washington Post innovators who brought down Nixon. We should be way ahead of that by now. We need to be, because the forces opposing democracy, the equivalent of 1974's plumbers, are moving much faster. We're erecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line&quot;&gt;Maginot Lines&lt;/a&gt; now, getting ready to fight the Battle of 2016, ignoring that &lt;i&gt;the enemy already controls our capital. &lt;/i&gt;They've been innovating. We haven't seen the results of their most recent innovations, yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another thing Facebook is good for. A friend  posted a request for a referral to a cardiologist. A far-away friend was quite sick. We figured out that wasn't right, they should call 911 and get to a hospital asap. I don't know what the outcome was, but it might have saved a life.</description>

			<title>Journalism's view of Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most journalistic pieces about Facebook view it as an online bulletin board with nightmarish advertising that's getting worse every day. For what it's worth, that's not how I experience it. The only political ads i see are from Democratic candidates who want money. Harmless and easily ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the last year I've started using a private group for Woodstock residents. It's a very civil place where people do the kinds of things towns do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few Republicans, occasionally someone says something inflammatory about Trump, but that's moved out the main discussion quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think people have an interest in civility because eventually you'll see most of them face-to-face, at the post office, grocery, in a park, on the new rail trail, a local restaurant, party. That is a real force for civility. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there's no question that it works, and it's worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've started to create my own private groups. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know it's in a silo, against my religion, but on the other hand, it's where the people are. Some things are more important than silos vs open systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when journalists write about FB as if it's a black and white thing, they aren't really doing their job. And their editors don't create room for other views, and they aren't doing their jobs either. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wish journalism would consider that it's not Dems v Trump rather it's Trump v Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution needs protecting.

			<title>NPR reporting is Republican</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;NPR isn't reporting the news, they're reporting Republican spin.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example this morning they talked for a half hour about the impeachment inquiry as a partisan issue, repeating the Republican claim that it's bad for the inquiry to be private. They said the Democrats in 1998 had the same objection, which wasn't true, because then there was a special prosecutor, Ken Starr, who did his inquiry in private before issuing his public report. As far as I know the Democrats never said this inquiry should be held in public. Even if they had it wouldn't have been. There are rules about the process designed to protect the accused and the process. NPR never presented the other side, how this all looks from the point of view of the Democrats, or more importantly, the Constitution, which is really what Trump has offended. (Could they cover a story without it being totally and inappropriatey partisan?)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why the hearings have been private. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The DoJ wouldn't appoint a special prosecutor, so the House had to do it themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Such inquiries are private to protect the accused because, if there is no indictment, they want to limit damage.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They want testimony to be private so the witnesses can't get their stories aligned.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Repubs also complained, through their NPR voice, that the president should have been given a chance to present his evidence. He &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; given the chance, and chose to try to obstruct the process instead of participating. Makes the Republican complaint seem hollow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/1189240745309421574&quot;&gt;thrilling comment&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cwarzel&quot;&gt;Charlie Warzel&lt;/a&gt; who according to his profile writes for the NY Times. He says &quot;there's almost no space for writing anymore that's joyful or an attempt to be creative. hardly anyone is playing around with form or even just trying to entertain. so much of the joy has been sucked out of the internet unless its crowdsourced by platforms from ppl who aren't paid.&quot;  The last three words in his comment are the point. Writing isn't something you necessarily get paid to do. I used to write advertising, and would have to pay thousands of dollars to have it run. It was still writing. Now I write because I like it.</description>

He says &quot;there's almost no space for writing anymore that's joyful or an attempt to be creative. hardly anyone is playing around with form or even just trying to entertain. so much of the joy has been sucked out of the internet unless its crowdsourced by platforms from ppl who aren't paid.&quot;  The last three words in his comment are the point. Writing isn't something you necessarily get paid to do. I used to write advertising, and would have to pay thousands of dollars to have it run. It was still writing. Now I write because I like it." created="Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:09:25 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/09/gilligan.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/10/30.html#a150925"/>

			<description>Brent Simmons wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://inessential.com/2019/10/28/no_etas&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; about how he can't say when a certain feature will be available with any accuracy so he doesn't try. I agree with what he said, but you can do it, by keeping a backlog of unreleased debugged features. If you use the feature yourself every day and it works well, you can probably estimate when it will ship to users, because you could do it tomorrow if you wanted (or at least start testing it). This is a weird idea in the old way of doing software, where people always release what they have as soon as they have it. A number of years ago I stopped doing that. I have a backlog of debugged usable stuff that only I have used. So if I announced a feature from the backlog I could definitely predict when it would be available.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a140306&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; how weird it is to see podcasts be so pervasive. Here's another example. The NY Post has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/charles-oakley-sounds-ready-to-re-enter-the-knicks-fold/&quot;&gt;Knicks podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I will probably listen, from time to time. Today's podcast is with Charles Oakley, a former Knick and fan favorite, who is &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=charles+oakley+james+dolan&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;hated&lt;/a&gt; by James Dolan, which of course makes him even more popular with Knicks fans. He says the Knicks can prove Kevin Durant wrong. Of course they can. The Nets stars need to learn about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=managing+expectations&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;managing expectations&lt;/a&gt;. If the Knicks show up and don't fall apart on the court they will have exceeded the bullshit hype of the Nets stars, both of them great players but probably not in NY after what they've said about the Knicks.</description>

Don't waste your vote on Tulsi. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That would do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blast that message everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;$1 million spent today is worth $100 million after she finishes positioning herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you haven't read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)&quot;&gt;positioning&lt;/a&gt; you should.

			<title>Morning dream notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Dreams are so funny. One of my recurring dreams all through my life is not being able to find my way home. I'd start going there, but realize I wasn't getting anywhere. It would go on and on, and I'd never get there. Well last night I had a weird variant on that. I was still trying to get home. I had parked my car somewhere, and was trying to get there, so I could begin my journey, but first I had to call my mother. I couldn't find the phone feature on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+iphone&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. I'd keep navigating through the menus thinking I was on the way to the phone, but I'd get lost and have to start over. It seems my subconscious has completely absorbed the UI of computers as reality. And even though I'm an adult and my mother is gone, I still feel the need to call her. And of course all this is going on inside me even when I'm wide awake. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also in my dreams last night, since I'm on the topic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Newmark&quot;&gt;Craig Newmark&lt;/a&gt; was partying. Dancing, telling jokes, introducing people to other people, being &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=gregarious&quot;&gt;gregarious&lt;/a&gt;. I was surprised because this is out of character for him. He's a very nice, considerate person, in real life. But he seems a bit reserved. I find him hard to read. I've known him since the early days of the web in the Bay Area. I defended him when the press took what I felt were unfair &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22craigslist+killer%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;shots&lt;/a&gt;, taking advantage of the fact that his product had his name in it, blaming him personally for the demise of print news. Ridiculous. So, I was happy to see Craig let go in my dreams. I sometimes say things that might have offended him, but he's never complained. Once I remarked, riding in the back seat of a car with him next to me that it was like being in a car with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Jemima&quot;&gt;Aunt Jemima&lt;/a&gt;. I had gotten the idea from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norton&quot;&gt;Peter Norton&lt;/a&gt;, who like Craig, had personally become a famous brand. He once said he was the Aunt Jemima of software. I thought that was clever. But of course Craig may not see it the same way. I tend to do that, take risks, I probably offend people from time to time, not meaning to, I assure you. I'm nowhere near as rich as Craig. Maybe that's why? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A number of people in the town where I now live have blogs and do podcasts. It feels weird to me, so far from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Columbus+Cir,+New+York,+NY/@40.7678762,-74.1215993,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258f63c9804b5:0xacca5e3d4112d7eb!8m2!3d40.767848!4d-73.9815219&quot;&gt;center&lt;/a&gt; of civilization, I guess there's a bit of pride, but mostly bewilderment. Like the guy who creates a new computer system in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine&quot;&gt;Soul of  a New Machine&lt;/a&gt; and sees someone using it and thinks you can't use this stuff. Heh. I don't play much of a role in these things anymore. Not sure I'd want to actually, though I think the software most people use for blogging is nowhere near as good or complete as what we had in the early 00s. Just a little factoring and UI reorg would make things flow much better. Podcasting has become a huge undertaking for people, with seasons and episodes, sponsors.  It should be imho like leaving a voice mail to a few friends. Nice thing is today it can easily scale up to millions of friends. That wasn't true at the beginning.</description>

Like the guy who creates a new computer system in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine&quot;&gt;Soul of  a New Machine&lt;/a&gt; and sees someone using it and thinks you can't use this stuff. Heh. I don't play much of a role in these things anymore. Not sure I'd want to actually, though I think the software most people use for blogging is nowhere near as good or complete as what we had in the early 00s. Just a little factoring and UI reorg would make things flow much better. Podcasting has become a huge undertaking for people, with seasons and episodes, sponsors.  It should be imho like leaving a voice mail to a few friends. Nice thing is today it can easily scale up to millions of friends. That wasn't true at the beginning." created="Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:03:06 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/29/psychoKiller.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/10/29.html#a140306"/>

			<description>I had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/sunfrost-farms-woodstock&quot;&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; last week with a new local &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markzip&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; who reads this blog. He's a former DJ at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiowoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;WDST&lt;/a&gt;, and from that he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zipsziggurat.com/&quot;&gt;built&lt;/a&gt; a business selling music at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyrecordfairs.com/&quot;&gt;fairs&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast. He was in the business when Napster rolled through. We shared some interesting stories. I told him what I had been hearing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/local-news/woodstock-site-of-wdst-and-bearsville-theater-sold-to-company/article_24d75aa4-ce5f-11e9-bdd4-db5cb1e71857.html&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/09/06/bearsville-complex-has-a-new-owner/&quot;&gt;sale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bearsvillecenter.com/&quot;&gt;reboot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rhino.com/article/new-this-week-todd-rundgren-the-complete-bearsville-albums-collection&quot;&gt;Bearsville&lt;/a&gt; and Todd Rundgren's old studio and stage. British dude, his sports are rugby and soccer. Not much overlap with this NBA and MLB guy.</description>

			<description>I was hoping podcasting would be more spontaneous and casual, sort of like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O52jAYa4Pm8&quot;&gt;Talking Heads song&lt;/a&gt; that goes like this: &quot;When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed.

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/kyrie-irvings-volatility-makes-nets-officials-queasy/&quot;&gt;reality of Kyrie&lt;/a&gt; is sinking in for the Nets. I didn't used to care about the Nets, and I still don't, but I wonder why Kyrie thought we would? Their story is only interesting because of the drama. I would have preferred if they grew slowly. New York is a dysfunctional NBA city, btw, in case it wasn't obvious.</description>

I just got it working with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/&quot;&gt;managed database&lt;/a&gt; on Digital Ocean. That's a big deal because I don't want to manage databases. Now I don't have to? So far I like it though there were too many hoops to jump through for the setup. A Hello World app for Node with step by step instructions would have helped. Good docs is the thing that sets Digital Ocean apart from AWS. This time I have to say they could be better.</description>

That was a good page, a lot of love was poured into it. But there was a broken image, I was immediately sure of the cause. The original server, a Mac, had unicase filenames. It's now hosted on S3 which has case-sensitive file names. So what worked when it was originally posted, now is broken, when served through S3. I guess it must be hard or impossible for S3 to offer unicase for HTTP requests.</description>

			<title>'Lock Him Up' is very American</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of things I've always admired about Cubs fans is that when an opposing team hits a home run, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field&quot;&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt; protocol demands that the fan who caught the ball throw it back on the field. It's a sign of disrespect. Basically fuck you and your home run. In baseball, that's cool. And it is in politics too, to throw back at a president who crosses the line of propriety every waking moment, to throw back at him one of the most vile and disgusting campaign slogans ever, in any political system, anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And last night, the crowd at the World Series game in DC did something most of us would love to do if given the chance. With President Trump in attendance, being called out on the scoreboard, they first booed him and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=world+series+game+5+lock+him+up+2019&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news&amp;iar=news&quot;&gt;chanted&lt;/a&gt; Lock Him Up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a Mets fan of course I don't usually have a lot of sympathy for Nationals fans, but this is bigger than baseball. I love what they did.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lock Him Up should be the chant at every sports event until he is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning on MSNBC we get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-lock-him-up-chants-are-un-american-72161349993&quot;&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt; from Morning Joe and Mika saying you shouldn't do that. And then Senator Chris Coons from Delaware, a Democrat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/467698-democratic-senator-criticizes-crowd-booing-trump-the-office-of-the-president&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the same. Respect the office if you don't respect the person. Well fuck you. We've been very civil through this whole process, and we're fed up. If you respect the office so much, Coons, why do you stand by and let him shit all over it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These people have the wrong idea about who we are. We're not children who are misbehaving. We're the electorate of this country, the ones who elected them, and we're saying if you haven't had enough yet, we have. It's time to do what we sent you there to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much damage is being done to our country while pundits and Democrats worry about which side of the plate the napkin goes. When you get him out of &lt;i&gt;our White House, &lt;/i&gt;we'll stop calling for him to be locked up. Do your jobs and until you take care of this just shut up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that the pundits and pols are making such a big deal about this, it'll be interesting to see what happens Tuesday night in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reaction from pols and pundits reinforces that it would be a good idea to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/21/140215.html&quot;&gt;permanent citizen's occupation&lt;/a&gt; of DC. 100K people, always there, walking up and down the mall chanting &lt;i&gt;Lock Him Up&lt;/i&gt; until the Repubs and Dems and members of the Supreme Court get the idea that the people of the United States are fed up not just with him, but with you too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Very few people use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/27/chatTabScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;Chat tab&lt;/a&gt;, so I took it out of the list of active tabs. I'm going to keep looking for the best form of interaction for blog readers. Right now, it seems to be Twitter. The software is still running and can be accessed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;chat.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I'm trying to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Spy&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix, but I keep expecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJZO5Hge2DY&quot;&gt;Borat&lt;/a&gt; to show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb3IMTJjzfo&quot;&gt;up&lt;/a&gt;. I'm watching for it. Anyway it's not that good. What is good that I found at random is the 1998 movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Simple_Plan_(film)&quot;&gt;A Simple Plan&lt;/a&gt;. It got great reviews, but don't watch the trailer, it's a total spoiler. On Amazon.</description>

			<description>I bet it's going to turn out that Al Baghdadi was working with a famous Democrat to rig the 2016 election. &quot;The server&quot; will turn up in several places along with &quot;the missing emails.&quot;</description>

			<description>All is right with the world. The Knicks are 0-3. Some norms will never be broken, it seems. BTW, they say the last time the Knicks had a winning team was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/13/jeremyLinWasACoralReef.html&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. Already a long time ago. Here's what happened in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/02/25/meloLin.gif&quot;&gt;single image&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>One of the many things wrong with our president is he never wins. He always feels he has to sell. Can you imagine, never a moment to relax, kick back, and savor your accomplishments? What a terrible way to live.</description>
