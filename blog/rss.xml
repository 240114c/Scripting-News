			<description>Following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/19.html#a141211&quot;&gt;travels&lt;/a&gt; of NakedJen. She made it to Seoul. I had a voice chat with her just after midnight Eastern. I wanted to discuss a possible twist to her travels. In Seoul, she has a good network through the University of Utah. Of course it's one of the few places where the virus is being fought effectively, the US is a somewhere between a shitshow and a clusterfuck. I wanted to suggested she skip the return to the US and just stay there for the duration. Of course she was thinking about that. She had decided to let fate determine the outcome. If her flight to Seattle wasn't canceled she would return. If not, she'd stay in Seoul, and not try to return through some other hub like Dubai. It's pretty clear now that there aren't going to be many, if any, more flights to the US from South Korea, or anywhere for that matter. At about 5AM, I got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/20/jenplane.png&quot;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt; saying she was on the plane. A few minutes later it &lt;a href=&quot;https://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL198&quot;&gt;took off&lt;/a&gt;. I'm happy, I'd like to see her again, and I'm not sure that could happen if she had stayed there. Also, I'm not sure if Jen is better off here, but we are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I saw a video of Trump listening to Pence speak on a conference call. People said he looked bored, but that's not what I saw. I saw he resented having to listen to Pence. What was Pence talking about? Saving our lives. Yeah. That's not important.</description>

			<description>Renting cruise ships seems like a good idea. Park them in the Hudson River, and use them for isolation. They have all the systems you need to keep people going. Or better yet instead of bailing out the cruise ship lines, buy the boats. We're going to need them for a long time. And will want to modify them.</description>

			<description>If you're a longtime reader of my blog, you know one of my best friends is &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+nakedjen&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; of Salt Lake City and Santa Cruz. Deadhead. First of her name. Dog person. Movie lover. Advocate for beets. &quot;The first faerie off the ferry.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/05/04/thecutelittlenut.html&quot;&gt;The cute little nut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/11/16/nakedjensBlissBag&quot;&gt;That's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2012/december/nakedjen2012&quot;&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, the CLN decided just as all hell was about to break loose in SLC to go to Bali. I watched it happen. I didn't say anything because I was sure lots of people were saying it. If this is what was meant to be, so be it. Anyway, as the shit began to hit the fan here, after Trump closed us off from Europe, I got word that Jen is coming home. Good. It hasn't been easy. Few flights, and lots of cancellations. But -- her flight from Bali to Seoul is at 1AM, which is 1PM Eastern. From there, I'm guessing she goes to Los Angeles and then to Salt Lake. I'm sure Jen will be Jen where ever she is. If she has to weather this out in Bali, or Seoul, or even LA. But we really do want her back in the good old US of A.</description>

			<title>What comes next</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been pretty frank here as the crisis developed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/142306.html?title=ourPrecariousPosition&quot;&gt;early March&lt;/a&gt;, and we now are much further along, and there's more bad news coming. I'm inferring this from what I've heard about what has already happened in north Italy, and what we know is happening here, from doctors, and public info. You can find links to all my sources on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Health care workers need protective gear, asap. This is a higher priority than testing, believe it or not. Here's why. A lot of health care workers in the US either have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&quot;&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; or are going to get it soon. When they get it a decision has to be made whether to isolate or not. Of course they should be isolated, not just for our protection, but to get them the rest and care they need. On the other hand, if they are isolated they can't care for non-medical people who are infected. So, there's an exponential curve operating here. Over time, all health care workers will have to be isolated, or infect new people, or get very sick and possibly die. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our health care system will fail.&lt;/i&gt; That means people who get the virus won't get help. You'll stay at home, and recover if that was meant to be, or not. It's too late to stop this from happening. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The supply chain for food and other essentials is shaky. I've learned a bit about that in putting together the &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/&quot;&gt;Woodstock Today&lt;/a&gt; page. The local retailers talk about the supply chain, openly, on the record. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/#1584550615000&quot;&gt;Cub Market&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/#1584558640000&quot;&gt;Woodstock Hardware&lt;/a&gt; for examples. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The best system we have, it seems to me, is Amazon plus UPS/Fedex. But there are real problems in that system, inside Amazon with infections at warehouses and in the delivery services. I have no idea about Amazon's supply side. However, some of the items I have ordered recently from Amazon have been delivered. I have a thermometer coming all by itself from China. I think however it will be returned by UPS at the very last step in the delivery chain. I hope not. I'd really like to take my own temperature! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I realized how essential Amazon had become I posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/17.html#a182847&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on the home page.  &lt;i&gt;Amazon has become the indispensible company. &lt;/i&gt;It's a huge problem that the president has a problem speaking with Bezos. This connection is too valuable to be left idle.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; has also become indispensible. They are really rising to the occasion. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, for people who think the incompetence here is unprecedented, it is not. Two examples in my own lifetime. 1. The AIDS epidemic. It took years before the US government recognized there was a problem and started fighting the virus. 2. Puerto Rico's hurricane and earthquake.

				<source:outline text="I've been pretty frank here as the crisis developed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/11/142306.html?title=ourPrecariousPosition&quot;&gt;early March&lt;/a&gt;, and we now are much further along, and there's more bad news coming. I'm inferring this from what I've heard about what has already happened in north Italy, and what we know is happening here, from doctors, and public info. You can find links to all my sources on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; of Scripting News." created="Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:09:36 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/19/150932.html?title=whatComesNext#a150936">
					<source:outline text="Health care workers need protective gear, asap. This is a higher priority than testing, believe it or not. Here's why. A lot of health care workers in the US either have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&quot;&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; or are going to get it soon. When they get it a decision has to be made whether to isolate or not. Of course they should be isolated, not just for our protection, but to get them the rest and care they need. On the other hand, if they are isolated they can't care for non-medical people who are infected. So, there's an exponential curve operating here. Over time, all health care workers will have to be isolated, or infect new people, or get very sick and possibly die." created="Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:10:08 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/19/150932.html?title=whatComesNext#a151008"/>
					<source:outline text="&lt;i&gt;Our health care system will fail.&lt;/i&gt; That means people who get the virus won't get help. You'll stay at home, and recover if that was meant to be, or not.

I've learned a bit about that in putting together the &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/&quot;&gt;Woodstock Today&lt;/a&gt; page. The local retailers talk about the supply chain, openly, on the record. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/#1584550615000&quot;&gt;Cub Market&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://woodstock.today/#1584558640000&quot;&gt;Woodstock Hardware&lt;/a&gt; for examples." created="Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:14:27 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/19/150932.html?title=whatComesNext#a151427"/>
					<source:outline text="The best system we have, it seems to me, is Amazon plus UPS/Fedex. But there are real problems in that system, inside Amazon with infections at warehouses and in the delivery services. I have no idea about Amazon's supply side. However, some of the items I have ordered recently from Amazon have been delivered. I have a thermometer coming all by itself from China. I think however it will be returned by UPS at the very last step in the delivery chain. I hope not.

			<description>The trillion dollar stimulus should go to shoring up the hospitals and food supply chain, and making sure people have enough money for basics. We should not be bailing out the travel industry. By the time this is over there will not be a travel industry. Money spent there is as foolish as spending money on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Don't piss this away. We need help.</description>

			<description>I ordered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/18/thermometer.png&quot;&gt;thermometer&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon for delivery sometime in April. They sent an email that it just shipped and it'll be here by March 23. How could that be? Are they sending it via bicycle? Well, turns out it's coming from China. We should be nice to China. We need them. They're going to help me keep track of my temperature. Maybe alleviate a little of my anxiety. Now the question is will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+ups&quot;&gt;UPS&lt;/a&gt; deliver it to me, or automatically return it without trying. Something they've been doing for a while now.</description>

			<description>Speaking of anxiety, I've been relatively anxiety-free since I got out on my own in my early 20s. All through my childhood I had terrible anxiety, which manifested in an unhappy digestive system. Always had a stomach ache, trouble controlling my bowels. Upset. I was always upset. I understood why totally, my parents created a very tense atmosphere, and after many years of therapy and self-examination I understood why they were so tense. But a few years after I established myself outside their house the digestive problems magically went away. They're back. Started just after watching Trump's Oval Office speech last Wednesday. I was already hunkered down. I understood what was coming. What was clear from his speech that he didn't. He was still throwing out racist bullshit. From the fucking Oval Office. After that, I realized fully how fucked we are. There have been moments of relaxation. But they're few and far between now.</description>

			<description>Highly recommend today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/podcasts/the-daily/italy-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; -- an interview with a doctor in Bergamo, Italy. They give an idea of where our hospitals will be in two weeks if we don't lock down immediately. It should be a country-wide thing now. Every day we delay makes it that much worse.</description>

			<description>I met a driver for a big delivery company that does a lot of work for Amazon. He said they can't get gloves or hand cleaners. They know the boxes carry the virus for up to a day. Can't get time off to take care of the kids, so the grandmother is. The union is involved. Sounds like the whole thing is about to be shut down, which of course should not be allowed to happen. We need direct-to-home delivery. It's hugely important. If we had a government this would be high on the priority list.</description>

			<title>Be careful with takeout food</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked a theoretical &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1239548652504391680&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to take a drive today. I like to stop off at a McDonald's and get an Egg McMuffin and a coffee on this drive. The question is -- is this safe? What if someone preparing the food has the virus. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everyone said it was not safe. Later I thought, wait -- the virus has to enter the lungs. If you eat it, it's harmless, it never makes it to the lungs. I asked a doctor friend. He says: You are wrong. Don't eat it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The virus in the food attaches to receptors on the cells of the back of your throat, like any cold virus, and is taken into those cells, after which you become infected. It spreads to your lungs later. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He continued:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it's super hot, that kills the virus. This is what I've been doing: order food, use gloves to touch the packaging. When you get home, open the package, dump the food out onto a plate, then throw that plate in the oven (or if you can heat on the stove, in a pot), then dump the packaging and wash hands. Packaging more likely to have the virus, but heat the food to almost boiling as well to ensure everything is dead. Hot food only, get a hot coffee and ice it yourself. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Someone should make a video game for the iPad (where I play) that simulates a virus infecting the population of Earth. Your job is to keep the most people alive and win re-election for the president (who randomly might be Trump, Obama, Hubert Humphrey or Elizabeth Warren). Or if you prefer, you can crash the civilization, have everyone behave badly, and die horrible deaths. You get to be god, as with SimCity. This might be called SimVirus. I bet someone has already done it.</description>

			<title>Driving notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I took a three-hour round-trip drive today. Had a lot of time to think and figured some stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There should be a clear and simple FAQ page that tells us how to increase the odds that we don't get the virus, but at the same time preserves as much of our quality of life as possible. I will start to write this, and check out what I write with doctors and medical researchers to be sure I get it right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-recession.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. There is no point trying to stimulate the economy. The economy is going down. A lot of companies are going to fail, or emerge very damaged. It's possible whole industries will disappear. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At the same time, other countries are getting back online after successfully controlling the virus. China, Singapore, South Korea and possibly Vietnam, will be careful to disconnect while the rest of the world tries to get the virus under control. It's hard to reboot a down economy. And the longer it's down the harder it gets. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The last two points combined could mean that if the US takes a long time to eradicate the virus, not only will a lot of people suffer and die, when we emerge from the pandemic we will find we have a wrecked economy, and no way to quickly recover. We may be ceding our status as a rich country. I know that's hard to grasp, but there's more at stake here than health, it's our way of life. Americans generally don't understand why we have an elevated standard of living, why the rest of the world tolerates our lunacy, as it escalates. They may love us now, but they'll forget that love when we are a less than first world country. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;New Orleans. Look at how hard it was for that city to get back on its feet, even though it's part of a country that wasn't much affected by Katrina. This time it isn't just one city, it's  the entire western world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Part of the trip was on the New York State Thruway. Happy to report there were lots of trucks on the highway. Presumably they're supplying the stores that have been depleted by hoarding. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I stopped at three drug stores on the trip. I have three items I need to get: hand sanitizer, a thermometer and acetaminophen. I was only able to get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol&quot;&gt;acetominaphen&lt;/a&gt; (aka paracetamol, Tylenol). If you don't have it on hand, you should -- they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus-ibuprofen-french-health-minister-scn-intl-scli/index.html&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; ibuprofen is not good to treat the symptoms of the virus, it actually seems to &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; the virus. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The failure of our government to test in the US is going to cost us trillions of dollars and many thousands of lives. It's the most expensive mistake in American history. All the more galling that it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;obviously&lt;/a&gt; done to cover up for the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-keep-passengers-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-2020-3&quot;&gt;stupid of reasons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the Republicans won't get Trump to resign, we really have to consider other means to make it happen. I am out of ideas myself, but I'm thinking about it. You should too. We've waited too long, and every day we wait means we're going to have to dig out of a deeper hole, and we're going to lose a lot of people. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every store I was in on this trip I had this thought: The virus is here with me. I don't know if that's true, but I believe it is. Thank god you can't get infected by breathing (true, I hope). I washed my hands many times today. :soap:&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Math is running the world now. Covid19 has always been a possibility. And of course our leader is the least math-savvy person you'll ever come across.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I took a three-hour round-trip drive today. Had a lot of time to think and figured some stuff out." created="Mon, 16 Mar 2020 20:07:09 GMT" flNumberedSubs="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/16/200703.html?title=drivingNotes#a200709">
					<source:outline text="There should be a clear and simple FAQ page that tells us how to increase the odds that we don't get the virus, but at the same time preserves as much of our quality of life as possible. I will start to write this, and check out what I write with doctors and medical researchers to be sure I get it right." created="Mon, 16 Mar 2020 20:07:36 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/16/200703.html?title=drivingNotes#a200736"/>
					<source:outline text="Listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-recession.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. There is no point trying to stimulate the economy. The economy is going down. A lot of companies are going to fail, or emerge very damaged. It's possible whole industries will disappear." created="Mon, 16 Mar 2020 20:09:05 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/16/200703.html?title=drivingNotes#a200905"/>
					<source:outline text="At the same time, other countries are getting back online after successfully controlling the virus. China, Singapore, South Korea and possibly Vietnam, will be careful to disconnect while the rest of the world tries to get the virus under control. It's hard to reboot a down economy. And the longer it's down the harder it gets." created="Mon, 16 Mar 2020 20:10:06 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/16/200703.html?title=drivingNotes#a201006"/>
					<source:outline text="The last two points combined could mean that if the US takes a long time to eradicate the virus, not only will a lot of people suffer and die, when we emerge from the pandemic we will find we have a wrecked economy, and no way to quickly recover. We may be ceding our status as a rich country. I know that's hard to grasp, but there's more at stake here than health, it's our way of life. Americans generally don't understand why we have an elevated standard of living, why the rest of the world tolerates our lunacy, as it escalates. They may love us now, but they'll forget that love when we are a less than first world country." created="Mon, 16 Mar 2020 20:11:26 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/03/16/200703.html?title=drivingNotes#a201126"/>
					<source:outline text="New Orleans. Look at how hard it was for that city to get back on its feet, even though it's part of a country that wasn't much affected by Katrina.

They deployed to Katrina when my dad and I were the first in St Bernard to arrive. Praying for my friends who volunteer in them. The demand outstripped availability there, and I expect the same as what happened then, that churches will serve the vast majority, since Red Cross/NGOs will be outstripped in capacity as well.&quot;</description>
