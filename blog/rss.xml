			<description>There's no excuse for congresspeople to use Medium. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/10319&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from Speaker Pelosi. Look at the URL. It looks way better than anything on Medium, and it has the advantage that it will remain on the web even if Medium shuts down.</description>

			<description>For people who get the nightly email, if you have a comment, just reply to the email. For now what you say is just between us. I'm thinking about ways to re-open the blog to interaction, but have it be as convenient as possible for the reader/contributors. I have powerful content management tools and I want to use them.</description>

			<description>The reporting on Ukraine misses an important point. Not only was Trump putting the squeeze on Ukraine to become part of his mob, he was also selling them out. A small relatively powerless country that depended on our protection, Trump was stepping back and letting Russia roll over them.</description>

			<description>Michael Moore was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWiqycRVkvc&quot;&gt;guest on MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; last night. It was really refreshing. He provides the perspective of a person. He thinks Biden should be leading the fight against Trump. I agreed with everything he said. Clear thinking. Totally worth watching.</description>

			<description>WIth &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/07.html&quot;&gt;Big 25&lt;/a&gt; coming up, it's great to hear from people who were reading in the early years.

He sent a link to an email he sent me, which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/stories/DavidBoroditsky.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; to the blog, in Oct 1996, two years after the start. He talks about the non-web features of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I forget that Frontier and the blog were two sides of the same coin in the early days. All the early blogging and RSS software ran in Frontier.</description>

			<description>Because Barr is in such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/2019/10/01/the-dangerous-position-of-william-barr/&quot;&gt;precarious position&lt;/a&gt;, and he's smart, he must have factored in the risk before going out on the limb. He's betting that he and Trump et al will be able to toss the Constitution in a trash can, and govern any way they want, without oversight and inconvenient co-equal branches of government. We're at much at risk as he is.</description>

The original idea, 25 years ago, was letting go of product ideas that I wouldn't be able to commercialize. It, in turn, generated ideas that would define a huge &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0&quot;&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>In the almost-25 years of blogging on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, I did take a few weeks off here and there. In the 90s, mostly to take week-long massage classes, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Hot_Springs&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; where there was no internet access, which was  common back then, believe it or not.</description>

			<description>My two cents on changing Facebook to keep its power manageable. 1. Its social graph should be a public resource. Spin it out. The APIs should be open like the web APIs are. 2. Facebook should peer with the open web, so it isn't a silo.</description>

			<description>Why is it that the future-of-news conversation is exclusive to people who have a vested interest in the way things are. If we've learned anything about the future -- of everything -- is that it's disruptive to the way things are.</description>
