The piece begins with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/02/10/cartoon.gif&quot;&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marlette&quot;&gt;Doug Marlette&lt;/a&gt;. I was told by a vehement reader that I didn't understand the cartoon, Marlette wasn't criticizing bloggers, he said, he was mocking the people (journalists) who criticize them. I thought this was a ridiculous stretch, even though it doesn't weaken my point. But I don't want to call him out on it if he was being blogger-friendly. Marlette was from North Carolina, and luckily I have a friend, John Robinson, former editor of the Greensboro News &amp; Record, who now teaches journalism at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unc.edu/&quot;&gt;UNC&lt;/a&gt;, and I guessed he would have known Marlette. He asked me to say this is just his opinion, he never discussed it with Marlette, who died in 2007 (or else I would have asked him). Robinson said: &quot;I knew Doug. He was a feisty SOB; a perfect trait for a cartoonist. I didn't see the cartoon the way the reader did. I think Marlette was criticizing the blogger. It was 2004; newspapers were still strong (we thought). Blogging was still new to journalists. (It's the year I started blogging as an editor and I got all kinds of skepticism from other journalists.)  He was feisty as a journalist. As a person, he was as gracious and generous as could be.&quot;</description>

			<description>BTW, people who think the web is over don't understand imho how technology flows. The web is basically repurposed Unix. It arrived the decade after the PC revolution. Conventional wisdom said that Unix was a small niche OS that programmers liked, but users primarily used Windows with a smattering of Mac. Along comes the web just as Bill Gates thought he had it all sewn up. Unix! When I first saw an HTTP url I thought &quot;users will never do this.&quot; Six months later there were billboards on Hwy 101 in Marin with URLs on them. They were talking about the web on radio and TV. Unix had the last laugh. So when the web reboots it might not be called the web. But look closely, at whatever geeky new technology people are raving about, and you'll see that at its core it's open technology. And that will build on the open stack, and the web will be the next layer down, and under that it's Unix.</description>

			<title>How to get started investing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, do not get a financial advisor. You need to get a feel for driving your own money. That imho is the most important thing. &lt;i&gt;You can do it.&lt;/i&gt; If you hire someone to take care of your money, you'll have even less of a feel for it than you do now (assuming you're keeping your money in a checking or savings account). And you'll grow to resent the manager the way you resented adults when you were a kid. Money has all that stuff tied up in it, sense of self worth, powerlessness, being an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&quot;&gt;impostor&lt;/a&gt;. Money is a symbol for every personal issue. Okay good for you -- you now you have some money, don't rush to give up your power. Embrace it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open an account at one of the famous companies, Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, E*Trade. They'll have a minimum amount to open an account of say $1000. That's how much you have to have to play with. And you should be prepared mentally to lose it all, even though if you follow my advice that is very very very unlikely to happen. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you read their advice they make it sound really complicated. I'm going to make it simple. Put the $1000 in the S&amp;P 500. It's a stock that's made up of 500 companies' stocks. You can think of it as a meta-stock. A stock of stocks. They're chosen by a company named Standard and Poor. The companies are chosen because they're solid earners, have been around a while, and together they reflect the performance of the stock market. Each of them is relatively low risk, but combined, they are very low risk. They track the performance of the stock market. If the market goes up, the S&amp;P 500 goes up, and down if the market goes down. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Historically, the S&amp;P 500 mainly goes up. That's why it's a relatively safe investment. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/04/04/sandpgraph.png&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt; of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 20 years or so. At times it does go down. There was a stock market crash in 2008, you can see that in the graph. But look what happened after that, it started going up again. There's a reason for that, btw, politically it's very bad for an incumbent president to have the stock market go down. So they do things to make it go up. You can buy a little piece of that with your $1000. It's why investing in an index fund like S&amp;P 500 is a no-brainer. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Only put $1000 in this fund at first. And then track the value of your investment. That's all you should do until you feel comfortable that you know what you're doing. It should happen pretty quickly. It's not even as complicated as the lottery. What I've told you here is really all you need to know. You can of course read up on it. But you've only risked $1000, so the most you can lose is (drumroll please) $1000. And unless the economy completely melts down, and then you have other huge problems, your investment over time is pretty safe. And you can make a lot of money doing this. Doesn't seem fair does it? (It really isn't.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now comes the fun part. Every day check the value of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; compared to the price you paid. Do this forever. Think about what it means. And it may give you ideas to look at other meta-stocks. And you may see yourself differently too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A note, they ask too many questions when you open an account at these services. They insist you answer questions you have no way to answer. Why not have a fast path to signing up. A button that says Hey I'm a Newbie Here and I don't want to answer any questions. I just want to put a little money in an index fund to see how this works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Thinking about my ISOJ keynote</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A week from this coming Saturday I'll give a keynote talk at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://isoj.org/&quot;&gt;ISOJ&lt;/a&gt; conference in Austin. The way it works is I talk for 20 minutes or so, then I answer questions from the host, Rebecca MacKinnon and from the audience. Here's my current thoughts on how to approach it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll start by showing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/02/10/cartoon.gif&quot;&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; done by a Pulitzer-prize winning editorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marlette&quot;&gt;cartoonist&lt;/a&gt; about the bloggers who were invited to the DNC in Boston in 2004. I was one of them. The cartoon betrays a point of view. His was that bloggers only had a PC, where reporters covering the DNC had a wealth of experience. It's a bold, condescending, arrogant statement and it's nonsense. I was 49 years old that year. My credentials at the time were as impressive as his. I had a good education from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;good school&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I was a research fellow at Harvard. I had spent decades proving myself in my field and had risen to the top. I had invented a bunch of technology that were in very wide use, and would form the foundation for all computer networking to come. I had been writing my blog for nine years at that point, and if I do say so myself, was a good writer. We were in the process of starting podcasting at the time. And I was just one of the DNC bloggers. The others were just as accomplished. You had to be someone special to be at the DNC in 2004. If he had bothered to find out who he was dissing, if he had any humility at all, he would have been embarrassed to be so wrong. Yet this is so much of what bloggers heard from professional news people. I don't mention this because my feelings were hurt, rather because it's a blind spot that has kept journalism from rising to the opportunity that is the two-way web. It's why Facebook is growing like a weed, and journalism is crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/04/02/cartoon.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid gray&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So dear ISOJ people. I come to you from tech. I have tried to work with journalism, many times. I've even succeeded a few times, in spectacular ways. Most of the time, I'm brushed aside as irrelevant, even when I'm an expert in the fields I am offering insight into. Areas that are all of a sudden very important to journalists. And I have some of the answers they seek. But they can't hear me, because they don't understand what I am. What am I? To you, I am a source. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Successful collaboration with journalism&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;SF Newspaper strike, 1994&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS with the NY Times, 2002&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Podcasting with WGBH, 2004&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back in the 80s when I was rising through the ranks of the software industry, one of the basic skills of being a tech CEO was to get journalists to write about you often and favorably. This, along with thoughtful product designs, were my big strengths. I wasn't a great manager, or money-raiser. But I could get good coverage, and my products were interesting, and one of them was a hit. (I didn't make Craig Newmark level money, but I did well.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the 80s journalists were an important part of our distribution system, as was advertising, which was 1/4 of our budget, along with product development, support, sales, cost of goods, administration. If we stopped getting coverage and stopped advertising our sales would also stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't have the web in the 80s, so talking on the phone with journalists was the way we traded information with others in the industry. I was a frequent source for the columns, Spencer F Katt, the Talking Moose et al and when new products came out from the big vendors, I was a reliable quote. When my copy of PC Week or MacWEEK came in, I closed the door and read the whole issue cover to cover. It was our pulse. We put news and gossip in and got the same out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How different that is from the way news works today, and at the same time how similar! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How did this transition happen? I actually know, because in 1994 the journalism system I described above had collapsed, as had the software distribution system. I was a Mac developer, but the consensus among journalists was that the Mac is dead, there is no new software for the Mac, and no reason to create more, because it's dead. Dead. Basically when reporters wrote about the Mac they just said it's dead and Windows is booming. Which was weird because they all used Macs. And there &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; new software, esp for the web. In fact the web was happening on the Mac. But the reporters were stuck in their groove about Windows' dominance the same way they are stuck on Facebook today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So while I had an excellent product, there was no way to get it past this barrier in the minds of the press. When Apple came out with a product that was positioned against ours, but really wasn't competitive, that was the end of public comment about us. And of course the company never recovered. So I was lucky, in a way, in 1994 when the web started taking off, I had the free time to see it, study it, and launch new ideas into it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;By following a formula for product development I've used my whole career, I tried an idea out to see if it worked, if it did, I'd build on it, see if that worked, etc. If you're chasing something good, it'll just keep building, each step will give you ideas of where to go next.  I had a glimmer of an idea that using the Internet, I could do for myself what journalism had been doing for me. I had a good rolodex, in it were the email addresses of all the people I hoped to communicate with using the journalists as I did in the 80s. Instead of going through the middleman, the journalists (they thought I was dead) I went direct. And boy did it work. Right from the start it was a phenomenon. So I fed the flames with more ideas and a little dirt too. I did projects with the local Bay Area news orgs. I wrote about how I thought IBM and Apple should get together. And that PDAs were going to be tethered to desktops. And then I wrote a letter about Bill Gates and how the Internet spelled doom for his plans of world domination. And then I got an email response from Gates, and I ran it. And in just a couple of months, I had created, out of nothing, a news channel of my own. I was a source, going direct, without a middleman. I called it DaveNet, it was me, just me, as a net. No organization. I was free to say what I wanted to say. I wasn't covering for anyone. It was one of the most incredible periods of my life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This process, sources going direct, has been going on ever since. At one point I radically proclaimed that every member of Congress would be a source that goes direct. Turns out I wasn't radical enough. Today the president of the United States got there because he went around journalism and talked directly to his constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This form of communication, sources going direct, is with us for good. It's the reason Facebook makes billions and journalism is collapsing. Had journalism, instead of fighting the sources, or ignoring them, and created systems to organize them, how much better everything would be. This is what we're waiting for, imho, for journalism to realize that the architecture of news has changed, and that they should embrace the change instead of fighting it, and find their new role in this new world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I'll start by showing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/02/10/cartoon.gif&quot;&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; done by a Pulitzer-prize winning editorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Marlette&quot;&gt;cartoonist&lt;/a&gt; about the bloggers who were invited to the DNC in Boston in 2004. I was one of them. The cartoon betrays a point of view. His was that bloggers only had a PC, where reporters covering the DNC had a wealth of experience. It's a bold, condescending, arrogant statement and it's nonsense. I was 49 years old that year. My credentials at the time were as impressive as his. I had a good education from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;good school&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I was a research fellow at Harvard. I had spent decades proving myself in my field and had risen to the top. I had invented a bunch of technology that were in very wide use, and would form the foundation for all computer networking to come. I had been writing my blog for nine years at that point, and if I do say so myself, was a good writer. We were in the process of starting podcasting at the time. And I was just one of the DNC bloggers. The others were just as accomplished. You had to be someone special to be at the DNC in 2004. If he had bothered to find out who he was dissing, if he had any humility at all, he would have been embarrassed to be so wrong. Yet this is so much of what bloggers heard from professional news people. I don't mention this because my feelings were hurt, rather because it's a blind spot that has kept journalism from rising to the opportunity that is the two-way web. It's why Facebook is growing like a weed, and journalism is crumbling." created="Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:33:16 GMT" collapse="true" subs="[object Object]" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html#a133316">

				<source:outline text="So dear ISOJ people. I come to you from tech. I have tried to work with journalism, many times. I've even succeeded a few times, in spectacular ways. Most of the time, I'm brushed aside as irrelevant, even when I'm an expert in the fields I am offering insight into. Areas that are all of a sudden very important to journalists. And I have some of the answers they seek. But they can't hear me, because they don't understand what I am. What am I?

				<source:outline text="Back in the 80s when I was rising through the ranks of the software industry, one of the basic skills of being a tech CEO was to get journalists to write about you often and favorably. This, along with thoughtful product designs, were my big strengths. I wasn't a great manager, or money-raiser. But I could get good coverage, and my products were interesting, and one of them was a hit. (I didn't make Craig Newmark level money, but I did well.)" created="Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:38:50 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html#a133850"/>
				<source:outline text="In the 80s journalists were an important part of our distribution system, as was advertising, which was 1/4 of our budget, along with product development, support, sales, cost of goods, administration. If we stopped getting coverage and stopped advertising our sales would also stop." created="Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:42:49 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html#a134249"/>
				<source:outline text="We didn't have the web in the 80s, so talking on the phone with journalists was the way we traded information with others in the industry. I was a frequent source for the columns, Spencer F Katt, the Talking Moose et al and when new products came out from the big vendors, I was a reliable quote. When my copy of PC Week or MacWEEK came in, I closed the door and read the whole issue cover to cover. It was our pulse. We put news and gossip in and got the same out." created="Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:45:06 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html#a134506"/>

				<source:outline text="How did this transition happen? I actually know, because in 1994 the journalism system I described above had collapsed, as had the software distribution system. I was a Mac developer, but the consensus among journalists was that the Mac is dead, there is no new software for the Mac, and no reason to create more, because it's dead. Dead. Basically when reporters wrote about the Mac they just said it's dead and Windows is booming. Which was weird because they all used Macs. And there &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; new software, esp for the web. In fact the web was happening on the Mac. But the reporters were stuck in their groove about Windows' dominance the same way they are stuck on Facebook today." created="Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:50:04 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html#a135004"/>
				<source:outline text="So while I had an excellent product, there was no way to get it past this barrier in the minds of the press. When Apple came out with a product that was positioned against ours, but really wasn't competitive, that was the end of public comment about us. And of course the company never recovered. So I was lucky, in a way, in 1994 when the web started taking off, I had the free time to see it, study it, and launch new ideas into it." created="Tue, 02 Apr 2019 13:52:40 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html#a135240"/>
				<source:outline text="By following a formula for product development I've used my whole career, I tried an idea out to see if it worked, if it did, I'd build on it, see if that worked, etc. If you're chasing something good, it'll just keep building, each step will give you ideas of where to go next.  I had a glimmer of an idea that using the Internet, I could do for myself what journalism had been doing for me. I had a good rolodex, in it were the email addresses of all the people I hoped to communicate with using the journalists as I did in the 80s. Instead of going through the middleman, the journalists (they thought I was dead) I went direct. And boy did it work. Right from the start it was a phenomenon. So I fed the flames with more ideas and a little dirt too. I did projects with the local Bay Area news orgs. I wrote about how I thought IBM and Apple should get together. And that PDAs were going to be tethered to desktops. And then I wrote a letter about Bill Gates and how the Internet spelled doom for his plans of world domination. And then I got an email response from Gates, and I ran it. And in just a couple of months, I had created, out of nothing, a news channel of my own. I was a source, going direct, without a middleman.

			<title>De-eliting journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a divide between the elites and the people, it's why the news orgs are constantly writing about how huge social networks are hurting journalism, but say nothing about how they hurt blogging. In their minds blogging was some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/02/10/cartoon.gif&quot;&gt;ridiculous idea&lt;/a&gt; that ordinary people could write about what they see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My mother would have told me it's because they're scared of you. I believe she was right about that. But it's a shame because if you want to crack the journalism puzzle (not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://membershippuzzle.org/&quot;&gt;membership puzzle&lt;/a&gt; a former colleague talks about), we're going to have to &lt;i&gt;de-elite&lt;/i&gt; journalism. It's going to be democratic. Written by you and me. It will be a civic thing, like voting or jury duty.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook could have been a home for this, if they had embraced blogging, but they didn't. They removed important features from the web like linking, simple styles, titles and enclosures for podcasting. Technically these are minor projects for a company with the engineering resources of Facebook. Like the journalists they were too arrogant to think there was value in what their users were writing. They just wanted to be the envelope within which we all lead our civic lives. But they didn't really believe in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the big picture for journalism in 2019, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
