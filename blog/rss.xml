			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1165713075468742657&quot;&gt;E-ZPass for news&lt;/a&gt;. I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.e-zpassny.com/en/home/index.shtml&quot;&gt;E-ZPass&lt;/a&gt; transponder on my car. This means I can drive on the highways of 18 states and the Canadian province of Ontario. The tolls are charged through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-ZPass&quot;&gt;EZP&lt;/a&gt; system. I could drive from NY to Chicago and use it on every toll on the way, or to Florida. Anyway, I think this idea would work really well for paywalls. Collect the money if I decide to read a New Yorker or LA Times piece, even though I have't got a subscription with either, which is analogous of being able to use the toll roads of Georgia even though I'm a resident of New York.</description>

I should have at least linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRRsE0LvUqU&quot;&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway without the video, the writing made absolutely no sense.

			<title>Why I use Twitter identity for the new email feature</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I posted a note on Facebook for people to subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/email&quot;&gt;new email service&lt;/a&gt;, I got a bit of feedback saying it shouldn't require a Twitter login. So here's why it works that way.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am gradually adding features to my blog that involve people more in what's going on here. You can Like items. You can comment on them. And now you can receive a nightly email. All but the last require identity, and if you want any options on how you receive your email, even that feature requires identity. (No such features have been implemented yet.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've been down this road before, it's not new territory. Back in the 90s and early 00s, we had blog hosting here, each blog had its own identity namespace. So I know how much human work it is to maintain such a service. I've done it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want the identity features but I don't run the identity service. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember it's just me here, and I'm doing this for free, before you judge me too harshly. If I can give Twitter a big job, that means I can do other work, or take time off, which I'm doing more these days. I'm not that ambitious anymore, I don't have anything to prove. And I think it's fair for readers and potential readers to understand that I'm nothing more than a human. Not trying to impress you with how much work I can do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to easily add features to scripting.com. That's why I use Twitter as the identity system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is one other reason. More and more my personal context is on Twitter. When they raised the character limit to 280 chars it became way more useful and it's a pretty good adjunct to this blog for short items. Very often I write something on Twitter first, and then copy it here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm using it for comments too. Because their restrictions actually make a load of sense for comments on a blog. I really just want to hear unique ideas, or simple bug reports. If I want more I ask for it in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22braintrust+query%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;. Their limits are a practical implementation of my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;comment guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. And being able to job-out a vital feature like comments to a reliable service, as Twitter has become, and as Disqus has become unusable, that's pretty welcome too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to keep up with all the changes on the net. Sometimes a nightly email is more than it appears at first glance. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dave in Woodstock</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I moved to Woodstock is that I want to try for once being a software developer in an artistic context. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've always seen software as a creative thing, like writing, painting or sculpting, but the rest of the world can't seem to process this idea. I've tried doing my thing in Madison, Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Seattle and New York City. Everywhere I go I get blank stares when I say I create software as an individual. But where do you work? I work for myself. Who do you sell it to? I don't sell it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do make money, from time to time, by selling something I've created, but most of what I create doesn't make money, the opposite, it costs me money to make. It's been that way ever since I was in my 20s and left Madison for Silicon Valley to make my fame and fortune. Like a musician goes to Nashville or Memphis, I'd say to my friends. I'm pretty sure they didn't believe me. I got lucky a few times, my products were hits, and I sold them to companies. I've tried being a CEO, and was able to do the job, sort of, but every day when I wake up, I'd rather create something than manage something. I don't like being responsible for other people's careers. So once was enough for being a CEO. It worked, we were able to go public, and the money I made made it possible for me to live a creative life, which is where I am most comfortable, most myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I make software for others. More recently I've made products only for myself, with pretty great results. Something new happens when you relax the assumption that the software has to be easy to learn. My target market, me, is amazingly up to speed on how the stuff works. (It's meant to be ironic.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've found it's no different here. People have a hard time understanding that you could do art with materials such as compilers, servers, editors, networks, display screens, etc. People in general have no idea what those things are but they're no less visible than the raw materials of writing (plot, character, arcs). I'm patient. Not pushing too hard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got a chance to start over, because this is not inherently a tech-loving community. The other day I used the word &quot;modal&quot; to describe myself. My friend had no idea what the word meant. I'm glad he asked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the very least I've relocated to an stunningly beautiful place, where the cost of living is way lower than in any of the previous places I've lived. The smell of the place reminds me of childhood, where we vacationed when I was young. That makes my inner child feel secure, as it did the first time around. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In a sense I want to go back to the early 90s, when blogging was still a twinkle in the eye, an intuition that if we created easy ways to publish, people would do it. The power of tech is that it becomes invisible and the message of the writer, the artist comes to the front. I see the combination of art, tech and protest being a powerful thing. We've been here before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It worked, we were able to go public, and the money I made made it possible for me to live a creative life, which is where I am most comfortable, most myself." created="Sat, 24 Aug 2019 13:44:48 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/08/24/132647.html#a134448"/>
				<source:outline text="I make software for others. More recently I've made products only for myself, with pretty great results.

People have a hard time understanding that you could do art with materials such as compilers, servers, editors, networks, display screens, etc. People in general have no idea what those things are but they're no less visible than the raw materials of writing (plot, character, arcs).

Usually at small fractions of a penny on the dollar. They don't care. Everything the country owns is ripe to plunder.

			<title>Woodstock on Netflix</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking through Netflix last night for something to watch, and they had this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81135868&quot;&gt;Woodstock title&lt;/a&gt;, so I clicked on it, thinking it was the Woodstock &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_(film)&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; from 1970, but it was something new, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thirteen.org/programs/american-experience/woodstock-kshqlw/&quot;&gt;from PBS&lt;/a&gt;, and it told the story from the point of view of the promoters. How they got the idea, how it morphed from being a studio in the town of Woodstock to an outdoor concert on a field in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallkill,_Ulster_County,_New_York&quot;&gt;Wallkill&lt;/a&gt;, the town limited the attendance to 5000 (there were already hundreds of thousands of tickets sold) so they had to scramble with just a few weeks to go, find a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Historic+Site+of+the+1969+Woodstock+Festival/@41.699124,-74.8813829,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1swoodstock+festival+bethel!3m4!1s0x89dca8a984798b11:0xe6d7490947a9149!8m2!3d41.7010945!4d-74.8804605&quot;&gt;new location&lt;/a&gt;, build a stage, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They told story of how they &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavy_Gravy#Woodstock_Festival&quot;&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; it such a peaceful cooperative event (it wasn't by accident). They were competent, smart, and driven -- and obviously under a lot of pressure from all sides, but they pulled it off. Remarkable and as it turns out, historic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I started watching i thought I'd watch for five or ten minutes, but I went all the way through. A great story well told. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It could have melted down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had to do a lot of stuff to prevent it from being a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example, they chartered a jet to fly in Wavy Gravy and Hog Farm to do security. An inspired idea. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then the NYS governor (Nelson Rockefeller) wanted to send in the National Guard to clear the place without any thought to the scale of the event. They had to somehow prevent that from happening. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They relied on army helicopters to shuttle medical personnel in, and that started rumors (remember this was 1969, it was as much an antiwar event as it was a music festival), and the guy on the PA system had to keep everything positive. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then it rained.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There was no food. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Not enough toilets. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Bad trips. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who knew how crowds work said there's no way this won't melt down, but it didn't. A lot of forethought went into it. Worth watching the show just for that part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>New feature. Now you can receive Scripting News every night via email. It's still in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/125&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; and there's a little more development work to do, but it's ready for people to try it out. I created my own system because I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/09/185406.html&quot;&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; more control over how it works.</description>

			<description>It’s time for a news channel that only reports on how we’re getting rid of Trump and Repubs. If there’s nothing to report they play old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV&quot;&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; from the 80s.</description>

			<title>Dave-by-email, day 1</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wish I had more on the home page for what will be for many their first Scripting News &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/125&quot;&gt;by email&lt;/a&gt;. A few comments. It's a bit of a loop-close because my blogging used to go out via email for years before I went exclusively web. Once &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; was up and running it seemed counter-productive to keep pushing the email channel, and for a while it made sense until Google dominated and then shut down their RSS app. Then email resurged. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In May 2017 I rebooted the original style of blogging on Scripting News, with intermixed titleless posts and and longer titled posts, all on one page, archived daily and monthly. It's now stable, so it made sense to bring back the email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember when I turned off the email, Doc Searls said I shouldn't do it. I never forgot that. Glad Doc is in the initial group of subscribers. I think that will affect the way I write here, for the better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I plan to add the linkblog links for the day to the daily email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Last night I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EthanZ/status/1163989963706380288&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2019/08/20/on-me-and-the-media-lab/&quot;&gt;Ethan Zuckerman&lt;/a&gt; had resigned as part of a developing scandal with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.media.mit.edu/about/mission-history/&quot;&gt;MIT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; and the notorious &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse&quot;&gt;child molester&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt;. My first reaction was this is a mistake. Wait until more is known about what happened. I think it would be more courageous to stay in his position, and help the organization deal with the crisis. And he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; staying through the academic year, according to his post. So I guess he's there for another year? A lot will change in that year. It was a very dramatic few hours last night. Twitter feasts on those moments. But there are people's lives, education and careers involved. Slow down and figure out what happened.</description>

			<description>Background: Zuckerman is a former colleague at Berkman Center in the early 2000s. His work and mine were related to blogging as a civic act, both our projects were very successful. I also know Joi Ito from Silicon Valley and he was a frequent contributor at BloggerCon. I visited both of them at the Media Lab in 2016. I wrote up my thoughts from that visit (of course) in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/21/1045.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Sometimes when you'd click on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/21/signOnButtonScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;Sign on button&lt;/a&gt; in the upper left corner of the home page you'd get taken to a bogus page.

			<title>If Trump were a reality show</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If Trump were an actual reality show instead of a fake one, a group of expat neo-Nazi Danes would form a government-in-exile (offices in Trump Tower in NYC) and would do a deal with the US to sell Greenland for very little money. Remember, they are the reality show version, so they need the exposure. Win-win. Their Instagram influencer channel goes crazy, orders for Danish &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackboot&quot;&gt;jack boots&lt;/a&gt; goes viral. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump declares war on the fake (in reality TV world, but actual in real world) government of Denmark. US war ships blockade &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Copenhagen&quot;&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;. There is a crisis in the UN Security Council (the reality TV version). Interesting confluence, at the exact same moment the real UN Security Council is meeting about how to re-exert its dominance. Meanwhile reality TV governments-in-exile form on Instagram for the UK, China, Russia and the Philippines. Ratings soar.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump announces his Christmas Special will take place at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoli_(Copenhagen)&quot;&gt;Tivoli Gardens&lt;/a&gt; amusement park in Copenhagen.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why would anyone get excited about what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Sarandon&quot;&gt;Susan Sarandon&lt;/a&gt; thinks? Her candidate Bernie is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=_e-o7svyOZw&quot;&gt;lookin good&lt;/a&gt;, but will anyone at all be persuaded by Susan Sarandon? She's had an incredible career for sure, but there are lots of stars at her level. Let's find out what Geena Davis thinks, or Brad Pitt or Kevin Costner.</description>

			<description>JavaScript drives program writers to outliners, because outliners are adept with dealing with nested callbacks, as opposed to the way most (all?) other languages do program flow through a flat list. In a normal language, the runtime proceeds from statement 1 to 2 and so on. I guess most JS programmers don't know about outliners, or devtools developers don't or whatever -- so instead of letting the &quot;problem&quot; be solved by editors, the language designers try to hack the language to make it better fit the editors we already use, but it just creates a hierarchic chaos that's meant not to look hierarchic. It's a total mess. So now JS is evolving to be Perl whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;There's more than one way to do it.&quot; It's far better for the ecosystem if there was only one way to do everything, but something as fundamental as program flow, I doubt if even Perl has more than one way to do &lt;i&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt; So Brendan Eich is not an outliner person, and neither are the people who work on the design of the language. You pretty much have to program JS in an outliner (as I do) to see this, imho. But before they hack the language again, see if the problem isn't the dev tools, not the language. Nothing wrong with callback hell imho if you have the right editor.</description>

			<description>How about a working group chartered to find the elegant and simple language hiding in the mess that JavaScript has become? It's there, I can feel it. First  you'd have to get rid of the runtime assumption that functions return before they're finished. It should be &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; for a function to explicitly fork off a new process, but it shouldn't do it just because the function made an I/O call. In practice 99.9999 percent of those simply want to wait for the I/O to be done. In all my years programming before JS, I never wanted a language to do flow the way JS does. That in itself is important data, imho. I've implemented a lot of different kinds of software.</description>

			<description>As a commercial software developer I had heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/19/infoworldReviewGuidelines.pdf&quot;&gt;InfoWorld's review guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, written in 1994, but had not seen them until yesterday when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/harrymccracken&quot;&gt;Harry McCracken&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of their review board, posted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1163143998782881793&quot;&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt; to Twitter. I asked if I could have a copy of the full manual so I could get them into the archive of my blog, and he kindly provided them. If anyone wants to reboot software reviews this would be a good place to start. In any case it's good to have this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/19/infoworldReviewGuidelines.pdf&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt; for future reference.</description>

			<description>I read this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/190818/p2#a190818p2&quot;&gt;VC appraisal of Dropbox vs Slack&lt;/a&gt;, which service was going to be the foundation for groupware in the enterprise world. I was unaware of this perspective and it was enlightening. I have studied both. Slack has the API, Dropbox went it alone. I think if Dropbox had fully embraced the idea that it was a developer's platform, there were a few small doors they had to open, they would have become the storage for networked apps. Same with Amazon S3. Each had the opportunity to bridge into the others' space, but neither has. I think the assumption at Dropbox was they knew everyone who was capable of making great groupware apps. That was their mistake. It's still not too late, they are dominant and totally baked in. They should be killing instead they are flailing. One of the biggest wasted opportunities I've seen in my career.</description>

			<description>I'm getting ready for my next binge -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/a&gt; season 2. I'm looking over the review summaries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/big-little-lies/season-2&quot;&gt;on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, and see they're all based on the first three episodes only. This was the same problem with software reviews, back when they did reviews of software (too bad they stopped). They would review the software based on a day's worth of use, if that much. But we design software so that it gets better the more you use it. We balance the tradeoffs. Of course we want the product to be easy to learn, but we also want it to be something you use all the time. It's as ridiculous to judge a serial show based on a third of a season. If I make it through the whole season, which seems likely based on the first season, I'll review the whole thing here on my blog. And I still have to relaunch &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/&quot;&gt;bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt; so we accumulate judgements of Scripting News readers on these shows. I have an idea how to do it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I don't know if anyone else finds &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt; to be unreliable, as I do, over many years. Here's a scenario. I have to make a minor change to a package. So I increment the version in package.json, and &lt;i&gt;npm publish&lt;/i&gt; it. Then in the app that's using it, I do an &lt;i&gt;npm update. &lt;/i&gt;The update happens. But the app doesn't get the latest version. Something is cached somewhere, because if I look in the node_modules folder, the new version is there. I've resorted to using a lib folder and keeping a copy of the package updated there. But of course I'm reinventing npm in scripts by doing this. Sometimes NPM works as I understand it should, but every so often it goes crazy like this.</description>

			<description>I groan when passwords are required to have at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase, a number and/or a special character. I know as a matter of math that these requirements doesn't make passwords better. Does it help people who type &lt;i&gt;asdf&lt;/i&gt; as their password come up with more random strings? Also I hate sites that make me create a new password every so often. I can manage that myself. I suppose maybe they're saying hey we were hacked recently and are requiring everyone to change their passwords instead of making a public statement.</description>

			<title>Why it feels good to stop judging other people</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On Facebook my friend Scott Knaster, who I've known since early Mac days, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1007571732783565?comment_id=1007692502771488&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; about judging things and people. &quot;A few years ago I decided to be really careful about using the word hate when I speak or write. E.g. I don't hate liver, or the Dodgers. It's a little thing, somewhat silly, but I like doing it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why it's easy to be friends with Scott. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;⭐️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1007571732783565?comment_id=1007692502771488&amp;reply_comment_id=1007698752770863&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D&quot;&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt;, also on Facebook: &quot;It's good Scott because you hear yourself say these things and deep down inside it creates dissonance. You're human. Judgement of others is way way above your pay grade. It's god's job, whatever that means, certainly not a mortal's job. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I really began to understand this when people in my family started dying. Opinionated and judgemental people. Okay what of their judgement now? Who the fuck cares. And all that angst. They could have saved themselves the pain. Because what they thought re good or bad meant not a thing in the end. Which means to me that it didn't mean a thing when they were alive either.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: There are some topics where judgement is fun. Such as the baseball teams we love and our hate for their enemies. You can see that in Scott's comment about the Dodgers (he's a diehard Giants fan). I would forgive him for hating the Dodgers, because it's basically self-mockery. And I hate do the Yankees. But when you break it down, what is it exactly that I hate? The Bronx? Certainly not. The stadium? Well it is an inferior stadium, no one can argue otherwise. But hate? I'm a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html&quot;&gt;barking farting chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;, looking for a little love and understanding in my short life on planet Earth. My hate wouldn't mean very much. But when it comes to baseball and the Yankees, it's mine. It migh† be all I have, so I try to hold on to it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lgm&quot; title=&quot;Let's go Mets!&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/11/metsLogo.png&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; height=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
