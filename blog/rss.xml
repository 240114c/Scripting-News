			<title>Glympse is great but..</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a friend driving from DC to visit me in the country. Per my request he's got &lt;a href=&quot;https://glympse.com/get-glympse-app/&quot;&gt;Glympse&lt;/a&gt; running on his iPhone so I can track his location as he drives. This yields the usual feature requests and a new one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should be able to yell something at my friend via Glympse that he hears. It should be like I'm in the passenger seat.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should also be able to play things on his radio.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And for $25 I should be able to commission a drone that follows him overhead. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How I got AWS to send my email</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; is a gift. Somehow one of the big tech companies decided that the PC era was worth continuing, and instead of locking up all the useful stuff inside their corporate wall, they went into business providing those tools to any developer who wants to use them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They aren't the only ones, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; is very good too, but AWS does more. Another difference is that Digital Ocean's docs are the best, and AWS's doc are in some ways the worst.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, I have to say AWS docs appear to have all the information about their services. So I can't say their docs are the worst in all ways, they aren't. The problem is the way the docs are written and organized makes it too hard for a newcomer, or someone who only wants to use the most basic functions, slightly beyond Hello World, to find the information they need. First you have to understand everything about the toolkit, and it's presented in a disjointed fashion where the docs assume you already know everything, which makes it virtually impossible for you to get the data you want. Every time I master another AWS toolkit it seems I write one of these pieces to commemorate the experience and hope somehow to encourage Amazon to make it easier for me next time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last year I finally got their email-sending functionality to work. The only &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1159477988712439809&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; was that every email I sent via their service arrived in Gmail with a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that it could be from a hacker (I knew it wasn't, it came from me). It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I learned what was happening and what I had to do to prevent it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First what was happening: I was sending an email from dave.winer@gmail.com through amazonses.com. Gmail said we got the mail, but noticed you didn't send it through gmail.com. Therefore the the big colorful &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I had to do to prevent it: &lt;i&gt;Send the email from another domain and convince Amazon that I was authorized to use that domain.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the place to note that nowhere in the Amazon docs do they say it this clearly. They try to tell you what to do on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/spf.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; with lots of links that center around a protocol called SPF. It turns out that SPF simply requires you to create a TXT record on the domain with a string that says what mail servers are allowed to use it to send mail, and that would be enough to convince AWS that you're cool. It makes sense, it connects the domain with a mail server. The person who set up the TXT record obviously is a god of that domain. But when I set this up per their instructions AWS still called the sender address invalid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then it turns out that I have to use a command line tool to give me a special domain name, and an encrypted value. This contradicts the earlier docs. And I had no idea how to get the command line tool to do this (it seems this would have been a good place for their docs to tell you or link to a place that tells you, but they don't). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I put the project down for a bit, went on Twitter, checked email, went for a walk, did something to cleanse the mental &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate_cleanser&quot;&gt;palate&lt;/a&gt;, came back to the problem and found docs that provided yet another option for convincing AWS that I was authorized to use an email address. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses-procedure.html&quot;&gt;interactive way&lt;/a&gt; to do it through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1#verified-senders-email:&quot;&gt;control panel&lt;/a&gt; for SES. This method worked, and in a familiar way. You tell it what email address you want to use and it sends a message to that address with a link. When you click the link AWS authenticates the address. Everyone who uses the web in 2019 knows how to do this. Why didn't their docs say up front, hey there's a very very very easy way to do this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now I can send email through SES and the receiver won't get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/10/warning.png&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; because I'm playing by the 2019 rules for email sending and using AWS to send the email. I'm a happy camper except for the fact that all this michegas took two days to sort out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Final note:  When we were working on SOAP many years ago, we were dealing with a similar problem. Our colleagues at large tech companies were adding an alphabet soup of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_service_specifications&quot;&gt;protocols&lt;/a&gt; on top of it, and just when you thought you understood what they were doing they added another few, and you were back where you started. I got fed up with this because I just wanted to deploy applications and didn't care about all this extra stuff, so Jake Savin and I wrote what we called &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090303082440/http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;A Busy Developer's Guide to SOAP&lt;/a&gt;. It defined a subset of SOAP that we had verified that works, and provided examples for developers of SOAP implementations to test with to be sure they worked with this subset. We published it, and then logged off the mail lists and got to work writing our blogging and RSS software. It worked. We got what we wanted and the big companies got to add all kinds of extra stuff. It seems to me that AWS is in a similar place. Developers like me who want to build apps, and systems people who want to cover all the bases. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I got an email from a long-time reader saying the thing that shocked him about my early web writing was that I told the truth. I wasn't trying to sell you anything. I just wrote what occurred to me. He was a mainframe programmer. I've thought about that, and I'd love to understand how one can be a programmer and not &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; be searching for the truth. Unlike just about any other profession I can think of, ours depends on telling the truth.&lt;i&gt;You can't lie to a compiler&lt;/i&gt; is one of my programming mottos. Garbage in garbage out. I write blog posts the same way a tester writes reviews of software. You have to be ready to hear the unvarnished truth. That's the ethos of blogging as far as I'm concerned. And it's why tech bloggers can do it better than most. Not saying they do of course. There was some real shabby blogging around HTTPS and &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, I kept wanting to ask if they debug their software with that kind of logic? (The equiv of asking a troll if they kiss their mother with that mouth.)</description>

			<title>Scripting News in email</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/08.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; Scripting News looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/09/scriptingNewsInEmailSnapshot.png&quot;&gt;pretty good&lt;/a&gt; in email. Learned a lot. Most of the problems were with how HTML email works these days, not Mailchimp. I needed to factor it out to see that. On the other hand they do some stuff that I can't &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYsw0KVRjCM&quot;&gt;abide&lt;/a&gt;, so this is a necessary exercise. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Caveat: I only tested in Gmail running in Chrome on a Mac. I'm sure other browsers on other machines and other email clients will raise their own kind of hell. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some of what I learned:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can only use standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography#Web-safe_fonts&quot;&gt;web fonts&lt;/a&gt;. I'm using Arial for everything.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can't include CSS files, all CSS has to be in-line in a &amp;lt;style&gt; element in the &amp;lt;head&gt; section.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Styles for &amp;lt;body&gt; are ignored.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't use lists unless you want their indentation. There appears to be no way to override it. I was using lists, per standard best practices, for stories. I did a hack and replaced all &amp;lt;ul&gt;s and &amp;lt;li&gt;s with divs, and styled them the way I wanted them to look. (This will fuck up deeply nested lists in my stories. Thinking about how to avoid that. Come to think of it, it will probably fuck up this very list. Heh.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm using AWS to send the mail, and I'm going to have to do some kind of dance to configure it to let me send email from an address I never use. I can't use my gmail address, because I am not sending the email from gmail. That is a new architecture of the net created by who-the-hell-knows since I last did any programming with email. Not saying it's bad, it was something I had to learn about. I suspect that it will be a rejiggering of the dance you have to go to get an HTTPS server, why not use the same dance? I will be learning more about this for sure. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/10/152118.html&quot;&gt;followup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Nothing new about Nazis</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Terms that must be banned:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;White nationalist 👉 white supremacist&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Neo-Nazi 👉 Nazi&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Racism 👉 genocide&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;By softening the crimes you make them more acceptable. Face facts, there is nothing new about Nazis. Nationalism might be okay, but not a master race. And the racism Trump is promoting is actually genocide.

			<description>I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Grade_(film)&quot;&gt;Eighth Grade&lt;/a&gt;, playing on Amazon. Good movie. You see inside a young girl's life, her self-doubt, relationships with friends, the evolving meaning of cool, trying out the idea of sex, sizing up her own future and past. Cringeworthy in places. I keep thinking about it, a sign of something worthwhile.</description>

			<description>I would of course like to tell you about my own eighth grade here, except I skipped that grade. I went to junior high between elementary and high school, and they had the option for students who passed a test to skip the grade. I opted-in. My sixth grade teacher, I found out much later, was opposed to this, she felt I was too immature and needed the grade to help get ready for high school. Considering what I did in high school, she might have had a point. Or it could be that she mistook creativity for immaturity. She was a good teacher, one of the best I ever had. I once raised my hand enthusiastically and burst out &quot;Mom mom call on me!&quot; -- to my great embarrassment. She said that was high praise. It was. That's how relaxed I was with her.</description>

			<title>Linux Journal wind-down</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today comes news that Linux Journal is shutting down. They say they'll be able to keep the archive online for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now here's an opportunity to do the wind-down the right way. Linux Journal isn't the ordinary publication that lets the domain registration lapse and stops paying the storage bills for the archive. And then next year it's a porn site or a phishing destination. I'm assuming the last people at Linux Journal care about the accumulated know-how and history at the site. And this event raises the question of how to do such a wind-down best. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the archive remains online and accessible at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxjournal.com/&quot;&gt;linuxjournal.com&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future so all pointers into the site continue to work. This might not cost a lot of money especially if the site is largely static content. So the first question is this -- is it? And if so, how much is there? With that data we can estimate what the annual cost will be and then set about raising the money. I would be happy to kick in some myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If not, then perhaps we can find a way to enumerate the URLs and then set up a service that redirects them to the archive.org version of the content? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps we could write a scraper that visits the pages, downloads a snapshot and stores them in static files. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;According to the site we have a couple of weeks to do the research and moving. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Two Democratic presidential candidates said historic things in the last week, but they have mostly gone unnoticed or misunderstood. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/bill-dagostino/2019/07/30/buttigieg-alludes-changing-2nd-amendment-cnn-moderators-ignore&quot;&gt;Pete Buttigieg&lt;/a&gt; said if we want change we're going to have to amend the Constitution. He's absolutely right. Changing the president, even taking the majority in the Senate won't accomplish much if a minority can overturn the whole thing any time they get it together. That's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, that's what has to change. Another thing that has to change is journalism. They can't incorporate new realities into their view of the world. They ask questions about Trump as if he were a normal president, one who had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-finance/trump-says-wont-divest-from-his-business-while-president-idUSKBN14V21I&quot;&gt;divested&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/the-presidents-tax-returns/&quot;&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; before taking office. Trump is a Russian oligarch. He takes his orders from Putin. Any question about the president that doesn't accept this context is a question from Dreamland. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1159116877316132864&quot;&gt;Beto O'Rourke&lt;/a&gt; busted through this crazy wall in the aftermath of the El Paso massacre. It's why we need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/depose&quot;&gt;depose&lt;/a&gt; the people who run journalism, asap. Why shouldn't the Democratic candidates help us transform politics and journalism? If they don't do that, why are they running? (To paraphrase Elizabeth Warren, who has done her &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/454500-warren-presses-pelosi-on-impeachment-some-things-are-above-politics&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; to transform how our politics and journalism work.)</description>

			<title>Why we fear death</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a theory about why we fear death. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a survival trait. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Animals that didn't fear death died. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Animals that feared death tended to live. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words most of us are descended from animals that were scared of dying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Preparing for 25 years</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On October 7, this blog will have existed and been continually updated for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were times I took as much as a couple of weeks off, but I usually blogged when I was traveling. I have observations, things I want to write down, basically all the time. I don't see the blog as work, to me it's more like a part of living.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It may be hard to remember this, but in the early days net connections away from home were exceptional. You didn't get internet connectivity in hotels, there were no cell phones. I once went for a two-week massage course without being able to check my email once. Even listening to voicemail required a drive into town! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot of other things happened while this blog was running. Needless to say there were no blogs when it started. There was only email, no instant messaging. No RSS or podcasting, no Twitter, Facebook, Google. Amazon and Netscape were less than a year old. Microsoft tried to take over the web and failed. Steve Jobs came back to Apple and brought us the iPhone. And much more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm thinking about how I want to celebrate this. It'll be the first time I put any forethought into such a thing. We went through 5, 10, 15 and 20 years with very little in the way of observation. Not sure why this one is special, but it seems that it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I'd like to know, are there any of the original email subscribers from 1994 around still reading the blog or on the net even? Does anyone have any of the original &quot;Amusing rants from Dave Winer's desktop&quot; emails? I'd actually like to know the exact time on 10/7/94 that the first email went out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to hear from people who read this stuff as it was booting up, as it started from a way to promote a friend's event, to a report on the event, to observations on tech products, to gestalts about &lt;i&gt;holy shit this is an incredible medium&lt;/i&gt; posts. It didn't take long for it to become clear that something interesting was happening here. I wonder what it looked like from the other side of the net connection. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some people said for sure what Dave is doing is preparing to compete with Stewart and Esther, charging $495 per year for a newsletter, and $2000 a year for an industry conference. I was never thinking about that, this blog has never had a business model. I never wanted it to, and I've written about why. I'm sure I could find it if anyone is interested. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway if you have a story to tell about this, email me at dave.winer@gmail.com. What did it feel like to receive the emails. What did you think was happening? When did it occur to you that you could write like I was or did it? Anything that you want to say I'm interested in hearing as long as it isn't flamey. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why change hurts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ben Thompson &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1158623851376304128&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The new Twitter for web is hilariously better than the old Twitter. It is amazing the degree to which people hate change.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1158696279544946688&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;There’s a reason. We incorporate the mechanics of software at a subconscious level after repeated use. It’s not amazing that we hate change, it’s rational. Something that used to 'just work' now takes effort to control. Until we incorporate the new UI at a subconscious level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1158698843564847106&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'm typing this on a QWERTY keyboard.&quot; Some standard UIs are so strong that they can never be changed. The original &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY&quot;&gt;QWERTY&lt;/a&gt; design was optimized to prevent a mechanical &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter&quot;&gt;typewriter&lt;/a&gt; from jamming. The keyboard on the iPad I typed that tweet on was completely implemented in software. Nothing that can ever get jammed. But the original reason it was designed that way is long forgotten. It's just the way keyboards are done. There have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin-script_keyboard_layouts&quot;&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; to change the design, but they proved too unpopular. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1158702258353258496&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. I can drive any car because there are invariant UI standards for basic controls. I might not be able to control air conditioning or the radio, but I can steer, accelerate, brake, indicate a turn, the same way on every car. It would be chaos if every time you rented a car you'd have to re-learn how to drive. That said, try renting a car in the UK, Jamaica or Japan where everything is on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic#History&quot;&gt;other side&lt;/a&gt;. It takes a long time to get used to it, even though at a conscious level the difference is simple to understand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet another example, one I like to cite a lot -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/12/weAreBreakingYourCityDealWithIt.html&quot;&gt;imagine&lt;/a&gt; if they remapped the streets of a city. &quot;Broadway will run east-west instead of the old inefficient north-south route. Now it will connect the Hudson and East rivers! You'll be able to use Broadway to get to Brooklyn or New Jersey. We encourage developers to build new tunnels that cross these two wonderful third-party opportunities.&quot; It doesn't work that way in real cities, but software platforms, managed by Google, Apple or Facebook (examples) often do. Nowadays even &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;open platforms&lt;/a&gt; do. Ugh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It helps to know something</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR -- everyone in tech could benefit from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science&quot;&gt;semester&lt;/a&gt; of Computer Science, to help them understand how the products are created. Just like someone in the auto industry should know a bit about how cars work, or in the wine industry how grapes are farmed and turned into wine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was just telling a story to Kevin Tofel over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KevinCTofel/posts/10157548873102082&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; about my first experiences dealing with analysts in the tech industry in the 80s. Kevin is a journalist and a consultant for tech companies. He plays a similar role to the early analysts, in today's context. He's taking Computer Science classes. I've been following along, remembering when the concepts he's learning now were fresh for me. It was a great time of discovery, I love how computers work, then and now -- and it's gratifying, in a way, that they still teach the same basic data structures. I guess they never change? I like that. Linked lists, balanced trees, hash tables and the like. I hope they have him build a compiler, that was the last mystery for me. Once I understood that there's no magic to it, I was ready to learn everything about computers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it amazed me when I was starting out in tech that the expensive analysts had never taken a class in computer science. Didn't understand the basic components of a computer. I wasn't sure how to talk to them. I wanted someone to understand how our outliners worked, and how we had tried two internal models before finding a third that had the good qualities of both and none of the bad. I thought one of the analysts should understand how the increasing capabilities of PCs made these decisions easier, and how we were planning future products based on further expected improvements. When you come down to it, the algorithms Kevin is learning now were important performance considerations for the software we were making, especially in the 80s when computers weren't as capable as they are today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I sold out to a medium-size tech company and they did their strategic planning by inviting one of the analysts in, asking what they should do, and then doing what they said. It was as if you ran a $100 million software company by asking Norm what products you should make. (Norm is Kevin's dog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMMhZu6-zCM9bc-4Tc6AJP46Hx1tiS-A9BEHNUfFy0YQsp8tlynNOauUt_dy8VVVA?key=RTlfWVQ0T21IbTVnZE9laGMtak55dWR4cVdNV01R&quot;&gt;cute&lt;/a&gt; and opinionated, but not too knowledgable about the economics of software.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I learned is this -- you have to relate to the analysts based on feelings. They have to feel as if you know what you're doing and then they'll echo what you say in your press releases to reporters looking for a quote. Another way to get them on your side was to pay them, by subscribing to the newsletters ($495 per year) and going to their conferences (another $2K per), and if you really were rich you could buy their consulting services (I suppose that the company I sold out to did). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What was interesting/funny is that they sometimes found the trends that mattered even though there's no earthly reason they should have. Maybe they tapped into some thread of knowledge that I didn't. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I tried something interesting, an audio response to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1158080571756687360&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Enclosed here as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/04/audioResponseToATweet.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. It's so twisted. But listen to it, I think you'll find there's a loop in how news deals with tech. It would be better if we could break out of the loop of course.</description>

			<description>A guest on Ari Melber last night (I think it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamalSimmons&quot;&gt;Jamal Simmons&lt;/a&gt;) said what I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/05/21.html&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; about the 2020 election. It'll probably be a Russian style election where the incumbent gets 98% of the vote. We can't afford to wait for that. Think about all the other crazy stuff the incumbent is doing, that we can see, and then the stuff that is being covered up. Depending on the election only makes sense as a distant Plan B. I think even most Republicans would see that at this time.</description>
