			<description>I went grocery shopping today. Took a couple of hours all-told. The supermarket was reconfigured with new protocols for moving through the aisles and waiting for checkout. Not too crowded, and almost everything I needed was there. Pasta is now the item in short supply. They had lots of cleaning products, I chose three, but they would only let me by one. I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Freak-Cleaning-Multi-Surface-Starter/dp/B07PHL372F&quot;&gt;Clean Freak&lt;/a&gt; because I loved the concept and the name. Yes packaging and branding still matter, even in post-apocalypse America. The only bacon they had was maple-flavored. Never heard of such a thing. On coming home I fried some up, and now the whole house smells of maple syrup. Not a good thing imho. Also -- they had toilet paper. Everyone I saw got some.</description>

			<title>Signed up for Medicare</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just completed signing up for Medicare including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans&quot;&gt;Medicare Advantage Plan&lt;/a&gt;. My two cents. When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XKoar34gBI&quot;&gt;Bernie says&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Medicare for All&quot; -- no I don't think so. It's a bastard child. Complicated and convoluted. Obviously something that has been fought over repeatedly in Congress. And in the end, after getting educated, and coming back again and again, I did what everyone seems to, shrug their shoulders, pick a plan and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The medical system should work like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You need health care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You get health care.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That's it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Medicare isn't that. It's way better than I what I've had up till now, ObamaCare, which was a vast improvement over what I had before that (I'd call it Maybe I'm Covered We'll Find Out When I Need It-care). It feels like graduating, finally I get treated like I matter, a little. And I'm pretty sure that if I get in deep shit medically I wll be helped. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But why should you have to wait until you're 65 to get that?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm not 65 yet, but soon. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: It feels like that great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3XX_z5wZn0&quot;&gt;moment&lt;/a&gt; in Goodfellas where Paulie says to young Henry Hill &quot;You broke your cherry!&quot; Basically every moment in Goodfellas is a great moment, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Glitch, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Lots more info about running Glitch apps &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, so far the only big limit I've learned about with Glitch is the inability to map an IP address to an app. But this may not be a problem because I use Hover as my registrar and DNS, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html?title=theyCanMap&quot;&gt;they can map&lt;/a&gt; a top level domain using a CNAME.

			<title>Horror film plot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Plot for a techno scifi horror film/retro political thriller.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Russia buys a famous movie studio that contracts with HBO to do a sequel to Breaking Bad. The season finale is broadcast with much fanfare on a Sunday night. Everyone is watching, esp people in skyscraper apartment buildings in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The opening scene has soldiers marching slowly across a very very very long bridge. They deliberately lower the volume on the broadcast so everyone turns up the volume on their super sound systems esp in those NYC skyscraper apartment buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They gradually increase the volume, causing the NYC apartment buildings to vibrate in sympathy with the marching soldiers, but the people don't notice because it's Breaking Bad and they &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; Breaking Bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The buildings undulate and sway and finally they all come down in a crash of the NYC skyline. Trump Tower collapses too, and the president, heartbroken, collapses and dies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Russia wins.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Trying out Glitch</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;, very interesting system, looks like what I hoped &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; would be, esp that now they have a way to run real server apps (no limits). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21220438/glitch-boosted-apps-subscriptions-coding-platform-anil-dash&quot;&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly worth checking out now as more than a curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is there a simple no-frills doc that explains the model for apps. How the filesystem works, how to access an app over HTTP. Can my app have an IP address? How do I know what port to use (port 80 gets me an error). I have succeeded at connecting to my app over HTTP but it comes embedded in something they constructed. Obviously this won't work for serving my non-experimental apps. I understand it's set up for newbies, that's cool. Now how do I strip it down so it works for its new intended purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168&quot;&gt;thread here&lt;/a&gt;. I know I've asked some of these questions before, btw -- but I'm approaching it now in a different way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A current-day NYC story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;From a friend in the city...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I just woke up about an hour ago, and really needing coffee and a bagel, so I put on my mask and went to my nearby bakery. Three people were inside, none wearing masks; I waited for two to leave then stepped in carefully. The remaining customer was a middle-aged woman who seemed to be speaking in great detail to the worker helping her, and getting very close to be heard, maybe 3 feet. The employees were all wearing masks (the crappy surgical mask type) but she wasn't. Then she went to pay and checkout and seemed to have another intensive conversation at 3 feet away from the employee at the register.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I thought I probably should have said something, I was still three quarters asleep at that point, but what should I have done in that situation? Did that woman already get sick and figured she didn't need to be careful? Was she a Trump supporter who wanted to flaunt the rules? Something in-between, or just a jerk? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Help me figure out what I should do the next time that happens, maybe you can crowdsource this to your readers? I want to clearly communicate to that person that her mouth is a lethal weapon, and that the bakery employees didn't deserve to be &quot;shot at&quot; just to be paid their 12 or 15 bucks an hour... but, you know, nicely. Thanks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Silver lining: that bagel was amazing, something about the 0.001% chance of dying really makes it that much better!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have an idea post a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/167&quot;&gt;note here&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a couple of mine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My fantasy answer comes from having ridden a bike in urban areas for many years. I dream of carrying a can of red spray paint with me, and when someone comes too close with their car and I have to slam on the brakes to avoid getting run over, I whip out the paint and put a red stripe on their fender or bumper. Then they would have to explain to friends and family how they got the red stripe. Shitty drivers would end up with &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to admit I once hit a guy's car with a stick on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@37.406063,-122.2491704,3a,75y,5.42h,91.82t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s_EmimMiikqlcJp5LPKtj1A!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3D_EmimMiikqlcJp5LPKtj1A%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D59.450317%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Mountain Home Road&lt;/a&gt; in Woodside. They get very upset when you touch their car. But he was in my space, I had to move out of his way to avoid getting hit. There was no reason for it, no car on the other side of the double-yellow lines. He was either really sloppy or trying to fuck with me. He pulled over, started coming toward me, and then stopped, presumably when he saw I was much larger than him. The car gives you a sense of size-of-body that isn't realistic. I told him to get back in his car and drive away, which he did. I may have actually dreamed this, not sure.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What Trump will do is not impotent or unobvious. He decrees (say) May 10 to be the date to re-open. States that don't re-open won't get any stimulus money. If you won't help yourselves, he'll say, why should the Federal government help you? That will &quot;make sense&quot; to his base as they rush off to their deaths. What happens after that, I don't imagine Trump has thought through.</description>

			<description>The pricing model of online pubs is as if each is publishing a whole magazine or newspaper, as they did before the web. I'm sure that's still their internal model, how their organizations work, but it's not the way we read them. We read an article here, another one there. Their pricing is utterly inflexible. It's a shame to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/rahm_emanuel_409199&quot;&gt;waste a crisis&lt;/a&gt;. We need information like never before. And they need money because advertising is evaporating. Can't we arrive at a compromise?</description>

			<description>Stop everything and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1249336590482243585&quot;&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; this presentation by Prime Minister Johnson of the UK. Incredibly powerful, credible, a perfect call for the British people. Now maybe he can knock some sense into the Republican leadership in the US. Also doesn't this make you wish we had an NHS in the US. I thought this was such a noteworthy speech we added it to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo podcast&lt;/a&gt; as a &quot;special enclosure.&quot;</description>

			<title>The post office is fine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The post office is fine. Repubs like to say government does everything wrong but it isn't true. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ever try to get help from an airline? Or an ISP? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I live in the country and we &lt;i&gt;depend&lt;/i&gt; on the post office.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I posted this earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I need to zip up a set of files in Node. Why isn't there a drop-dead simple API for doing this. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa50ae77b8929bcad55c8b7125a6f3ba&quot;&gt;pseudo code&lt;/a&gt; for how I'd like to do it.

			<description>It took about a half hour to realize the thermometer I got in the mail today was not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvs.com/shop/kinsa-quickcare-smart-digital-thermometer-for-all-ages-prodid-2180122&quot;&gt;Kinsa thermometer&lt;/a&gt; and that's why I couldn't configure the Kinsa app to talk to it. D'oh. God is goofing on me today. I ordered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085Y6H3CZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;thermometer&lt;/a&gt; in March as a test to see if the world would still be here in May. Haha joke's on me, it is. PS: It got here a month early.</description>

			<description>I have mixed feelings about our demonstrations for health care workers. It could be interpreted not so much as appreciation as &quot;please save us.&quot;  The health care worker might resent this. I would. Why couldn't you heed the warning sooner? But it's good because it's a reminder to ourselves that there will be no simplistic solution to this problem. The applause is for us, for having the resolve and discipline to stick with it. And knowing no matter how painful it is for us, we have it easy.</description>

			<description>There's a myth that every dollar the government spends is from taxes, i.e. &lt;i&gt;taxpayer money. &lt;/i&gt;Far from it, It's at least partially invented money or borrowed money, esp when it comes to bailouts and pointless wars. It's all good when the money is invested in a positive way, that creates growth, or value for the citizens of the country, now and especially future. Education is one great example, health care, and esp public health (as we're learning now). When we burn the money by blowing up far-away countries, or give the money to big companies for no reason, or the super-rich, it does nothing for us, or really for them. It's like scattering the money to the wind.</description>

Use this kind of outline for documents you want to add to or refine over time. FAQs, guidelines, instructions, screeds. Definitely not for blog posts, since there's no time element in it. There's lots of depth to this kind of outline, and it's easy for me to add new features. So that's an extra bonus. If a small community of writers develops here, I will have incentive to show you how to use the other features, and perhaps add new ones.</description>

			<description>I chose this route for rolling out rendering for outlines very deliberately because it &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; include blogging features. It's focused on writing. There are already countless ways to blog.

			<description>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/164&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; about Apple podcasts. The new &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; podcast shows up in my iPhone podcasts app. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/10/cuomoScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. It also shows as having updated. But when I look at the page for the podcast it only shows episodes through Tuesday. Today is Friday. Is there something wrong with my feed? I want to get this working properly. I also noted that Sunday and Monday are missing too. They are most definitely in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Testing and contact tracing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Testing and contact tracing is central to turning the lights back on before there's a Covid19 vaccine. Since the US government isn't doing it, we have to do it. We can't afford to wait. Lives and livelihoods are at stake. Too important.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Testing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Testing is doable. Since the FDA is a bottleneck maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-09/california-declares-independence-from-trump-s-coronavirus-plans&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Masachusetts and any other state who cares about its people can break free, or work with the US government's FDA to loosen things up so we can get say 10 million tests done per day for the forseeable future. You should be able to get one whenever you want one.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I heard on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer Show&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/how-testing-will-help-us-get-back-regular-life/&quot;&gt;morning&lt;/a&gt; that the testing part apparently is doable, we can scale it up. It'll cost $100 billion to start, but if it got us out of this mess a month sooner it would be a good investment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact tracing&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/10/831200054/cdc-director-very-aggressive-contact-tracing-needed-for-u-s-to-return-to-normal&quot;&gt;Contact tracing&lt;/a&gt; is easily solved, very quickly. It's more of a political problem than a technological one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://privatekit.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT has an app&lt;/a&gt; for contact tracing. It has the right privacy configuration, the information isn't shared without you sending the data somewhere. By default it never leaves your phone. But the MIT app is on very few phones. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Apple and Google and others have &lt;i&gt;very good&lt;/i&gt; data for contact tracing and their apps are widely deployed. World-wide. We wouldn't just be solving the problem for the US, we'd be doing it for everyone everywhere who has an iPhone or Android phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they are reluctant to even say they can do it for fear of the backlash. It's time to have this conversation. Maybe the surveillance aspect of the new technology is worth supporting if it saves lives and can easily be turned off, by the user, when we're no longer in crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt; is the expert on this. I'll ask him what he thinks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after this piece was posted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology&quot;&gt;Apple and Google announced&lt;/a&gt; they're going to work together on contact tracing. Wow. That's quick turnaround! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I remember how hard it was to stop smoking in the years before I actually did. I would make a little progress, and feel okay I can have one now, I've been good, and then I go right back to two packs a day. Getting rid of the virus is going to be like that. Just when we feel like we have it licked is when you have to double-down on the commitment. It's so easy to let up, relax. And go back to the thing that was killing you.</description>

A non-smoking story at the Bowie concert last week. As I'm walking out I see people lighting up everywhere. Smell of smoke all around. It smells good. I really want one. In my mind I outline the steps it would take to be smoking and the amount of time it would take. I would ask someone if they could spare a cigarette. If they said no I'd offer them $1. Oh hell, just offer $1 to begin with. Whoo, where would I get a match. I'd ask for a light. Take a drag. Estimated time, 15 seconds to one minute to first nicotine rush. My heart started beating faster. I felt scared like you feel on a NY subway platform as a train is entering the station and you're standing on the platform and in the instant before it passes you think how you could end your life by leaning forward.&quot;</description>

			<description>A couple of months ago it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/08.html#a184531&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to bug me that I didn't have a DVR for my TV, haven't had one since I gave up my TiVO when I left Massachusetts in 2004. Now my cable setup is Spectrum, because that's the only cable supplier where I live, and their TV package, including HBO, Showtime, and the rest of the stuff. I used it mainly for HBO, MSNBC, Law &amp; Order and the occasional Knicks game. I set out on a quest for an alternative, and the best I came up with is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; which I am now subscribed to. The other choice was Hulu, which I have used and liked. Not sure which is better. Anyway, I got my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder&quot;&gt;DVR&lt;/a&gt;, so I can watch last night's Maddow when &lt;i&gt;The Trump Show&lt;/i&gt; is on in the early evening. And I don't need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insider.com/when-sports-return-from-coronavirus-hiatus-nba-mlb-nhl-2020-3&quot;&gt;sports&lt;/a&gt;, because there aren't any. And I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://channelstore.roku.com/details/8378/hbo-go&quot;&gt;HBO app&lt;/a&gt;, along with Netflix and Amazon. It's a good setup.</description>

			<source:outline text="A couple of months ago it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/08.html#a184531&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to bug me that I didn't have a DVR for my TV, haven't had one since I gave up my TiVO when I left Massachusetts in 2004. Now my cable setup is Spectrum, because that's the only cable supplier where I live, and their TV package, including HBO, Showtime, and the rest of the stuff. I used it mainly for HBO, MSNBC, Law &amp; Order and the occasional Knicks game. I set out on a quest for an alternative, and the best I came up with is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; which I am now subscribed to. The other choice was Hulu, which I have used and liked. Not sure which is better.

			<description>The Fake Friends of Facebook are getting so freaking obvious and numerous. Every day I get ten or twenty friend requests from &quot;people&quot; who are obviously made-up. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/09/fakeFriendRequestsOnFacebook.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of some of them. I'm amazed Facebook's algorithm can't filter these.</description>

			<title>Biden can make a difference now</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Biden can assemble a panel of scientists and medical doctors to keep the public informed. An hour a day, press conference style. What the CDC would be doing if Trump weren't president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And he (Biden) would step back, an example for what Trump should do. Let the doctors and the military manage it. Stop campaigning while thousands of Americans are dying. Biden wouldn't even have to say it. It would make Trump look immediately tone deaf which he most certainly is.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea so appealing right now is that the governors are linking up and sharing resources. Someone should be providing the science for them. The government is failing. But there's plenty of unused talent out there, it just needs to be managed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another reason -- it would mean that in order to compete, Trump would not only have to enable his scientists, he would also have to start using the US government money as it must be used, not for whatever bullshit he has planned. If he doesn't why should anyone listen to him? By giving him TV power the networks have made it unnecessary for him to use the government's economic and military power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
