			<description>For the first time, in 2019, I have a doctor who uses email, and there's a portal where I can see results of my medical tests. How many people would be alive today if more doctors used email earlier.</description>

			<description>I'm moving apps from an old server where Dropbox stopped working to another old server where Dropbox still works. It's like taking apart a robot and putting it back together. Lots of wires to hook up. And just getting the old pieces off the old server without Dropbox was a pain the ass. Lots of chances for mistakes. I really need to make this kind of thing easy. I know just use containers. But it's at the next level up where I need more factoring and abstraction.</description>

			<description>Imagine you were alive in the 1920s when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T&quot;&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; became a mass market product. A movie star gives a speech saying Ford must make perfectly safe cars that no one ever dies in. Would you have realized then that it was unattainable?</description>

			<description>An idea for a New Year's resolution. At least once a day agree with someone. Not silently. Say &quot;I agree with you.&quot; No qualification, not &quot;I agree with you, but..&quot; It's jarring at first, then liberating. And the responses will surprise you.</description>

			<title>Holiday season binge-o-rama</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's the best time of year for binge-watching. I'm up to date on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. As far as I'm concerned they could stop right here at episode 7. Best season &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Mr+Robot%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;. But there are still six more episodes in the series. Now I'm working my way through the third season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt;. Another tour de force. Waiting in the wings is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Man in the High Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt;, which is fantastic even though it got &lt;s&gt;awful&lt;/s&gt; mixed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. I only watched the first three episodes, the ones that were released when AppleTV+ came out. I want to wait until the season is done so I can watch it in a binge. I'm not a big fan of waiting a week between episodes. I'm a fairly modal person in most things I do and TV is certainly one of them. I also know a few people who are just now catching up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Succession&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;. Can't wait to hear what they think. No spoilers. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- the reason &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; got bad reviews is that it isn't what a newsroom really is like. Because presumably the reviewers know what newsrooms are like. The rest of us don't. We loved &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; even though it was nothing like working in the White House. Dramas depend not on the reality of what they portray, rather the ability of the writers, actors and technical people to tell a story that pulls you in, gets you to care, makes you forget you aren't in their world instead of your own. They become your friends, and you develop an intimacy you can't get with your real friends and family. That's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/a&gt; is so good. The writing, acting, and everything else are done by people who know how to get you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; you want to go. Whether it resembles the way newsrooms work, the only people who care about that are reviewers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also -- one of the great things about Mr Robot is that the writers understand how software works. They do take shortcuts and at time make word salads of tech jargon, but most of it is about things that hackers would really do and use. One thing they gloss over is bugs. Elliot and Darlene's code always works the first time. They never get so much as a syntax error. I'm waiting for the next generation shows where the plot revolves around a platform vendor removing a feature that the firewall depended on and the hackers figure it out and Evil-Corp crumbles and the Dark Army takes over or someone worse than Trump ends up running the country. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1198188964278079488&quot;&gt;Democratic impeachment strategy&lt;/a&gt;: House hearings continue indefinitely, until Senate agrees to remove president. Explore every nook and cranny of Republican corruption. Target Repub senators up for re-election in 2020. Draft articles of impeachment are posted publicly and kept current, registered voters can vote individual articles up or down. A full week of hearings on why Republicans are repeating Russian talking points. How about the July 4 visit to Moscow by senators. Why are Repubs so beholden to Putin? What happened in Helsinki? So many questions. Let’s get the answers.</description>

			<description>Occam's Razor says if you want to grok the hows and whys of the Republican Party,  look at how the political system of Russia works. Why do the members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assembly_(Russia)&quot;&gt;Russian legislature&lt;/a&gt; do whatever Putin wants? That's why the Repubs do what Trump wants.</description>

			<title>UPS no longer delivers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Living in the country, as I do, I order a lot of stuff on Amazon. The nearest department store is about 40 minutes away and it's a Walmart, not exactly my favorite place to shop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the last week the UPS driver on my route decided not to deliver to my house. The reason keeps changing, but it seems there's nothing I can do about it, so I gave up. I asked the UPS people in Kingston to return the packages to Amazon. I expect Amazon will refund the purchase price. They're usually pretty good with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are no Amazon lockers nearby. But UPS has a relationship with the hardware store in town (8 minutes from my house). That's going to be my next approach. To see if there's a way for UPS to deliver my packages to the store. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And while the UPS people I've talked with have been professional overall this leaves a really bad feeling here for UPS. One day they deliver to your house and the next day they don't. Whatever the reason (it keeps changing) it's not cool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just had a freaking nightmarish development experience. I was moving an app on a server, and the address of the server was hard-coded in an Electron app I use. I figured when it changed, I could just edit the source and rebuild. I know everything should be an option, but this was just for me. But when I rebuilt it, Electron would have &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of it. So much deprecation. So I ended up on a trail of tears having to update one thing after another, and they all refused to work with something else that had just changed. Platform developers, stability is something we should rate you on and you should get paid accordingly. Typically it's highly paid developers at BigCo's who feel entitled to pull the rugs out from under our apps and tear up the pavement just for the hell of it. Oy oy. Two oys. But shit I'm good at taking the punches, and now it's running. Whew. Back to work on fun stuff.</description>

			<description>People should simply use their names in the space where you put your name in a tweet. After a couple of years of playing with it, I find it's confusing to put messages there. An example.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dweinberger&quot;&gt;David Weinberger&lt;/a&gt; is someone I would read every &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/22/tweetexample.png&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; of, but sometimes miss because he's endlessly creative with his twitter name.

			<description>A long time ago I was having lunch with someone I thought was a friend. He told a story about how he tried to buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt;, a product I developed, from the company that owned it. I guess at the time he didn't know that I still owned a majority share of the company. The people who were running it never brought the idea to me. I asked why he didn't just try to work with me. I would have totally been open to the idea. He explained he wanted to own it. I've seen this happen over and over. People who build careers with products that are copies of stuff I had already done. I keep wondering why we couldn't work together. They do it in other creative fields. I just got caught up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt;. I picked the right moment to do it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=rm+robot+season+4+episode+7&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;S04 E07&lt;/a&gt; was a total masterpeice and a big reveal. Look at all the talent that had to come together to make that happen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tracks.ranea.org/post/35606102112/mistitled-andrew-singer-rip&quot;&gt;Andrew Singer&lt;/a&gt; a former colleague said once that in tech we don't stand on the shoulders of giants, we stand on their toes. It's so sad. I know at some point we will work out collaboration. We have to.</description>

			<description>American journalism is never far from falling back to the horse race in everything. Who the hell knows or cares how many senators will ultimately vote to remove. It's impossible to know, or even if the vote will ever happen. Waste of time to speculate. And it isn't even up to the senators, it's up to the voters. The senators will vote to remove if it means they feel they will lose their election.</description>

			<description>A lesson I've learned from recent successes in blogging. You must always think of your blog as if you were starting it now, not in the past. The world is different. There was no Twitter in 1994. Twitter wasn't usable until last year with the switch to 280 chars. Facebook was used for serious discourse (somewhat) until a couple of years ago. Email is resurging as a publishing medium. People are still thirsty for stories that relate to their lives. But getting into their minds with all the competition requires constant creativity. Not showmanship.</description>

			<description>NYT reporters are supposed to care about facts, yes? Why do they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/19/nytreportexcerpt.png&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt; to “turn up damaging information about Democrats.” Not true. They just wanted an announced dramatization of an “investigation.” That’s all they needed or sought. Probably because there was no actual damaging information. That’s the depravity of Repubs. They manufacture insinuation, not information. And the complicity of the NYT for accepting their lies as fact.</description>

			<title>Republican Marshall Plan, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote about the need for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/18/150738.html&quot;&gt;Marshall Plan for Republicans&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't explain what the original Marshall Plan was. After the Allies won WWII, the US did something unusual for a victor. We rebuilt the country we defeated, Germany. We didn't have to. In fact at the end of WWI we did the opposite. We imposed reparations on Germany. Then came the Depression, and thus were planted the seeds for a rebirth of Germany as an even more ferocious military force in the second war. There was no third war, probably thanks to the Marshall Plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union&quot;&gt;Soviet Union broke apart&lt;/a&gt; in the early 90s, we kicked back, not a terrible idea, because any intervention by the US would probably have been seen as a threat. That would come later, during the Obama presidency, when Putin was reinstalling a Soviet style government, and we, via our State Department, were encouraging the opposition. Nothing wrong with that, except it didn't work. And we're left with a Putin who seeks revenge, and knows nothing helps a despot like a foreign enemy to blame everything on. That would be the pre-Trump United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we're on the verge of defeating the Republican Party. I don't want to go into detail on that, I can -- imho it'll seem obvious in hindsight, like the dissolution of the Soviet Union seemed obvious after the Berlin Wall came down, but until it happens it can be hard to visualize. The Repubs have been a fixture in American politics all our lives. But it has been changing all the time, trying to put off the inevitable by becoming more and more insidious relative to constitutional America. And now people of the party, the base, will be forced to decide. Finally we have broken Trump's monopoly on news flow. They're broadcasting the hearings on Fox, they have to. And it's going to get worse, much worse, in the next few days, for the fascists in the Republican Party to keep the base unaware. There is a splitting coming. The question is how big. My believe is that it will be big enough to create an opportunity that we should not miss. A chance to rebuild America before we fully fall apart. To be a Marshall Plan for ourselves. Because now finally we will have to accept Republicans as our fellow Americans, with some differences, important ones, but underneath it all, we don't try to steal elections and we accept that no one is above the law, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; the president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we don't bring the constitutional Republicans in, without a solid majority in the Senate even with a Democratic president, we'll just see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/courts/news/2016/07/14/141210/mitch-mcconnell-a-legacy-of-obstruction/&quot;&gt;McConnell Stonewall&lt;/a&gt; again. Obstruction. Nothing happens. And Trump, second of his name, comes along in 2024, this one is not Baby Huey, and a true fascist, much more schooled in the ways of America, and one who plays the part of president much better than this Trump does. That really will be the end of America. We'll be out of moves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is a rewrite of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1196779504322125827&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter is becoming pretty useful as a place to develop my ideas before writing a blog post. This is a good example of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Old folks just want MAGA</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is why old people are conservative. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you age your body wears out. This happens to people at every age, but it first starts to be noticeable in your 40s, and it keeps getting worse until in your 60s, where I am now, you have permanent aches that don't go away. You live with them. From time to time you think about how great life was at 22, when everything worked at peak performance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back then if you hurt yourself, you got better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then when someone says Make America Great Again, you remember the old days when you were young, and think, yes, that's what I want. Because you felt good, the sex was great, and you had your whole life in front of you. You confuse your youth with the country. Never mind that today's 22 year olds are thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=fucking&quot;&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; you were thinking about then, and their view of the future is expansive, even infinite, and old age is just something to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_nFwwjBlEc&quot;&gt;sing about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Feat: And you know that you're over the hill when your mind makes a promise that your body can't fill.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then you remember how much you have to deal with now, and when someone says they're going to really shake things up you think fuck that shit, I want my MAGA. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Radio UserLand reprise?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An unsolicited &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bb/status/1196267156268298241&quot;&gt;testimonial&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Radio+UserLand&amp;t=hx&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking, it was a good combination of features. Blogging integrated with a feed reader. In 2001. It was the product that defined blogging for many, including people who went on to write popular blogging software. And it was where podcasting was born. Radio was both a podcatcher and a tool for managing a podcast feed. It did both sides. I don't know of any product, 18 years later, that does that. And it was easy. We really honed the UI. By then we really understood blogging, and were ready to make it flow. I would put Radio's design up against any popular blogging software today. I think it would win. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I thought hmm, we're within striking distance of being able to do it again. The thing that made Radio, still to this day a unique product was that the CMS ran on your desktop. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html&quot;&gt;fractional horsepower&lt;/a&gt; server. It was a repackaging of Frontier. Very few people knew that there was a powerful scripting and object database system running on their machine. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/04/19/suspensionOfDisbeliefAppli.html&quot;&gt;virtuality&lt;/a&gt; was pretty complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today we could do an even better job of that using JavaScript, Node and Electron. I have an RSS feed reader &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/04/19/electricRiverV041b.html&quot;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; in Electron, and it would be quite easy to get Radio3 running in there too. Then all that remains is a remixing to do the integration. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Something to put in the hopper. Thinking about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Following up on yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/16/153957.html&quot;&gt;american.newbie&lt;/a&gt; piece. True story. I went to eat Chinese food with my Mom a few years ago. Highly rated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/flushingstore_eng.html&quot;&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/136-21+37th+Avenue,+Flushing,+NY+11354/@40.7619076,-73.8325639,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2600fe1184edf:0xc9f4b28c9f22d92a!8m2!3d40.7619076!4d-73.8303752&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; I grew up, many years ago when it was a sleepy boring place with an embarassing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the people spoke Chinese. We had to wait quite a while for a table. When we were seated the waiter asked if we were tourists. I laughed and said no we're natives. The funny thing is that not that long ago we were the newbies. The food was fantastic, btw. So many flavors, very satisfying. Before the Chinese came, Flushing was famous for nothing in the way of anything, in the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://macaulay.cuny.edu/seminars/gardner08/articles/f/l/u/Flushing_History_d81a.html#Dutch_Rule&quot;&gt;three centuries&lt;/a&gt; at least. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A neighbor who gets the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; says I should go easier on Elizabeth Warren. I love getting comments from people I see who read my stuff. It's an affirmation that I exist, in some fashion, and at least one person is listening. I like that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now&quot;&gt;Alan Kay&lt;/a&gt; said that Macintosh was the first PC worth criticizing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e&quot;&gt;Jean-Louis  Gassée&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/03/10/speakingOfTheCluetrain.html#4&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the higher the monkey climbs a tree, the more people can see his  derrière. I criticize Warren as a front-runner, the likely nominee, and because POTUS is an important job, esp the next one. It's not enough to win as Democrats, we have to win for the Constitution. Overlook our differences just for one election. There used to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Republican&quot;&gt;liberals&lt;/a&gt; in the Republican Party, no reason the Democratic Party can't have expat Repubs. We're fighting for our soul as a country. Imho everything else is a detail to be worked out later.</description>
