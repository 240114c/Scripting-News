			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/024939.html&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; was in my dreams last night. I remember one part. She's in the other room lying down reading, something she did a lot, and for some reason I called her on the phone. We hadn't spoken in a long time. She said &quot;an angel is calling&quot; in a very sentimental way. She never said stuff like that. This morning I wonder maybe I was the one who died? Happy Mother's Day mom, where ever you are, or where ever I am. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>New feature in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=chat&quot;&gt;chat tab&lt;/a&gt;, permalinks. If you roll your mouse over &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/12/permalink.png&quot;&gt;the time&lt;/a&gt;, next to the author's name, you'll see it's a link. Click the link to get to a page with just that item on it. It's a permalink to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.scripting.com/story?day=2019/05/12/&amp;id=136&quot;&gt;story page&lt;/a&gt; for the item. That means you can point to a comment the same way you'd point to a blog post. It will continue to work even after there's a rollover of the chat stream (a fresh start that I'll do periodically). However story pages will not survive moderation, so this isn't a place to write a blog post. Respect the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;comment guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>My Facebook Manifesto</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're getting the downside of networking and not enough of the upside because progress is stalled due to Facebook's dominance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they had created a thriving ecosystem not underneath them but alongside them, no one would be talking about about breaking it up, it would already be in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everyone who's ever pursued a monopoly in tech should see (now) why it's a dead end. And people who in their hearts felt the web should stay open, you were right, it's the only sustainable option.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's easy and economical for Zuck to give up his monopoly and it doesn't require divestiture or breaking up. And it's necessary to get the web growing again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Key point: We have to have more than Zuck's mind working on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Doc Searls has an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/05/11/podcasting/&quot;&gt;interesting idea&lt;/a&gt;. Ask the big search engines to add another &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/11/searchCategories.png&quot;&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; to search -- Podcasts. That would help make clear that podcasts are a thing of the web.</description>

			<description>I haven't listened to a podcast in two weeks, not even the Daily podcast. I plan to come back. But right now I'm reading an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker&quot;&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; about Robert Moses and how power works. I had read it a long time ago, before I knew much about power myself. It's interesting in new ways at the other end of my life. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Mother's Day could benefit from being split in two, one holiday for people whose mothers are alive and one for those who aren't. For the latter, it would be a time of reflection and forgiveness. Holding on to the lessons and the love, and letting the other stuff go.</description>

			<description>In 1985, Apple did something bold and brave with the Mac, they included &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleTalk#AppleTalk&quot;&gt;networking&lt;/a&gt; with every Mac they made. This meant that if the APIs were easy for developers to adopt, to build on, the Mac would have gotten a huge wave of Mac-only networking software. There's no doubt that in my mind that the web would have booted up on the Mac, possibly years before it did on the NeXT platform. But the Apple networking APIs were impenetrable, so only a few developers, who probably secretly got help from Apple, or who were especially good at reverse-engineering APIs, managed to break through. Too bad, because when the web finally came along in the early 90s it didn't have a GUI, it wasn't WYSIWYG, and since this was the basis of Mac software, it's why Apple was slow to adapt to the web, even if their developers, now liberated from Apple's lock-in, rushed to adapt and led the early web. Apple definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing&quot;&gt;benefited&lt;/a&gt; from their decision to build-in networking, but they could have hosted the web, and we all would have gotten the benefit of the Mac user interface. The web would be very different, and imho much better. This should be a lesson for Facebook. If they bend down to be &lt;i&gt;part of the web&lt;/i&gt; instead of casting the web aside, long-term they'll own a huge share of the growth that comes from lots of independent developers working alongside them.</description>

			<description>Things have really changed politically in our country, but it doesn't &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; that way. Maybe each of us should take responsibility for changing something really big about ourselves, how we present ourselves to the world, to mark the change so we all feel it more.</description>

Anyway, I was driving on 23 today and passed the diner, remembered it from childhood, so I stopped and took a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/chiefDiner1.jpg&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/chiefDiner2.jpg&quot;&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 09 May 2019 18:07:30 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/coffeeCup.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2019/05/09.html#a180730"/>

			<description>People say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZybYIJtbcu0&quot;&gt;Tuca and Bertie&lt;/a&gt; is the next level of Bojack Horseman and it is that for sure. For example, in T&amp;B there are people and animals, as in Bojack, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/plantAsACharacter.png&quot;&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; also have intelligence and speak and have legs and can walk and go places (and are teenagers). Also they include little bits of non-animated &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/09/humanInTuca.png&quot;&gt;human stuff&lt;/a&gt; in it. And the snarky Easter eggs are even better. But it's also got a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli&quot;&gt;Studio Ghibli&lt;/a&gt; in it and trippy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away&quot;&gt;Spirted Away&lt;/a&gt; type stuff. I love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://deadline.com/2019/05/tiffany-haddish-ali-wong-tuca-and-bertie-interview-tribeca-1202605920/&quot;&gt;actors&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I've been saying this for many years -- I wish as part of the publicity materials for shows, movies, even products, they produced standalone images that have a transparent background, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/bojack.png&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for Bojack. I love putting them in the right margin when I'm writing about your product. It's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; for you.</description>

			<description>At least we know one leading Democrat won't compromise. Elizabeth Warren said it so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/05/07/warren_defends_call_to_impeach_trump_no_political_convenience_exception_to_the_constitution.html&quot;&gt;clearly&lt;/a&gt; last night on MSNBC. Our moment of compromise will come when we are forced to take a loyalty oath to Trump. You may be sure you won't do it, but in the moment you will have a conundrum as to whether or not you sign the pledge.</description>

			<description>New &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=chat&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; feature. Ted posted a chat message yesterday that I didn't see for many hours. Not good. Disqus used to send me an email message when a new comment is posted. So I added that feature here. I now get an email when a message is posted.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman&quot;&gt;Paul Krugman&lt;/a&gt; has been writing for decades about how Repubs are wrong and hypocritical about economics. He's very persuasive and of course I totally agree. Now the Dems have been wrong too, also for decades, about not standing up to the Repubs breaking our system of government. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-obama-wall-street-torture.html&quot;&gt;every step&lt;/a&gt; they choose to ignore and overlook instead of investigating and fighting. It happened regarding torture in Iraq, the financial crisis, the Merrick Garland nomination, etc. It'd be interesting if Krugman could write one of his famous pieces about the Dems. Repubs aren't listening to him, but Democrats are. There is no option now but to stand up for the Constitution, or there will be no election to win in 2020. They can't put it off any longer, this is the end of Congress if they don't. Someone outside of government who people listen to, needs to say this.</description>

			<title>Feedback for WAMC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have something to say about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wamc.org/&quot;&gt;WAMC&lt;/a&gt;. Every time I tune in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wamc.org/topic/alan-chartock-message-president&quot;&gt;Alan Chartock&lt;/a&gt; is talking. He's their expert on everything, but all he says are platitudes. The first time he got my ire up he said &quot;Everyone knows that X&quot; and it pissed me off because X is not true (imho). He likes Joe Biden and Israel. He talks and talks and no one interrupts him, no wonder -- he owns the station (or so it seems).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to listen to NPR to retain my sanity in the morning over coffee while getting my mind organized for the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't believe everyone doesn't hate him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Someone tell him to chill out please. Or retire. Yeah that would do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: There was a Law &amp; Order &lt;a href=&quot;https://lawandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Seed&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; where it turned out that a fertility doctor had been impregnating patients with his own sperm. There was a small army of his children in NYC. Not sure if it was based on a true story. Anyway that's what it's like.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Living in Manhattan, with no car, I got used to FreshDirect where you order groceries via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://freshdirect.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and they deliver what you ordered the next day. You develop a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/07/freshDirectList.png&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of items you buy regularly, and shopping is a matter of reviewing that list, and re-ordering the things you need more of. Very efficient, and I rarely forgot basic items, because they floated to the top of the list. Now I'm shopping in grocery stores, basically walking around through their warehouse in realspace, doing the job FD employees do in NY, and while I like the experience in general, I often forget to restock things I've run out of. Which makes me wonder why stores don't adopt the FreshDirect user interface, let me shop for basic stuff from home via the web, even if they can't deliver.</description>

			<description>My friend NakedJen who to me is the Mother of Dragons, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/11/16/nakedjensBlissBag&quot;&gt;magical person&lt;/a&gt; who can do the stuff only Daenerys Stormborn can do (and more), is now watching Game of Thrones, finally. She's in season 1. I can't say any more (here) because I know she reads this blog. I envy her, I would love to never have watched the first few seasons so it could all be new again. Also I expect to be able to hear her shriek at certain points even though she's in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Salt+Lake+City,+UT/Catskill+Mountains,+Shandaken,+NY+12464/@40.1479294,-111.1033669,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x87523d9488d131ed:0x5b53b7a0484d31ca!2m2!1d-111.8910474!2d40.7607793!1m5!1m1!1s0x89dc665668f82f31:0x3b012376423b8efa!2m2!1d-74.3821116!2d42.0092908!3e0&quot;&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt; and I'm in the Catskills.</description>

			<description>A browser JavaScript challenge. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/playingcards/&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt;. Use the up and down arrow keys to move from card to card. When you get to the bottom of the screen the cursor moves to an object that is not visible. I want to scroll the window vertically to make the cursor object fully visible. If you look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/playingcards/code.js&quot;&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see a routine named  &lt;i&gt;scrollToMakeVisible. &lt;/i&gt;The goal is to fill in the body of that routine. I've opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/116&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.</description>

			<description>I tried cross-posting but it doesn't work. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/09/04/endingAnExperiment.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; it up. The problem is that the silos don't support cross-posting in any direction. They really want to be worlds unto themselves. The web, as far as they're concerned, isn't worth supporting, even though they couldn't exist without it.</description>

So after I read his piece and think &quot;everyone should see this&quot; I can't send the link outside of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have this incredible thing called the web and we don't use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same thing when a person I admire and who is doing great stuff to help keep the web open, writes her latest report on Medium, where it is already behind a paywall and will likely disappear the day Medium runs out of ideas how to monetize news.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Streaming in the kitchen</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I live in the country, in upstate NY, the only NPR station I get is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wamc.org/&quot;&gt;WAMC&lt;/a&gt;, which I'm not crazy about, primarily because there's this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_S._Chartock&quot;&gt;one guy&lt;/a&gt; who I think is obnoxious who seems to always be on. I'm thinking it might be time to get an Amazon Echo, even though I dislike the idea of bringing an always-on listening device into my home. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1125047788499275777&quot;&gt;item above&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter without enough background info. This is for the kitchen. Of course I already know about streaming stations available in a web browser. There's no place for a laptop on the kitchen counter, along with the toaster, coffee maker, microwave, etc. People have also recommeded Sonos, but they are doing the same thing as the Amazon Echo, they run the exact same software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I know what I have to do...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sangean-WR-2-AMWooden-Receiver-Walnut/dp/B0009ZAA4M&quot;&gt;Sangean WR-2&lt;/a&gt; radio I currently have, which I bought in 2007 for the house in Berkeley, is a lovely product. Not cheap. But I've used it almost every day since then. Listening to the radio in the morning is part of my daily ritual. I love that I've had it so long. But of course there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075313J1R/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1&quot;&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; that has all the features I want. The best one is simply that it supports Bluetooth and that means anything I can play on my iPhone that's always in my pocket I can play on the kitchen radio. It means however that I'll have to replace the radio I love so much. Oh well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a lot like replacing the 10-year-old Sony screen that I have with a new 4K screen. The quality is better, for sure, but the biggest reason to buy the newest version are all the new standards they support. Without that it remains an island, it can't connect to the other devices. In the last decade connectivity has gone from a promise to reality. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Rant du jour</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched a little MSNBC last night and don't like the way it's going. They're turning the crisis in DC into a horse race. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not Democrats vs Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the United States of America vs a gang of thugs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Don't make the Dem leadership responsible, we all did this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's time for the US to grow up. We've had it very very very easy. We fought two wars with no discomfort at home. We are fat and spoiled.

			<description>I've been taking pictures of my countryside explorations, and found that my top of the line &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_XS&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; isn't doing a good enough job, so I thought I'd try dusting off the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_5D&quot;&gt;Canon EOS 5D&lt;/a&gt; my father left me, and see what it can do. I went though some of the pictures, the quality is amazing, esp for a camera that's over ten years old. Here's a small bit of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/02/lafayetteStreet2011.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; I took on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bleecker+St+%26+Lafayette+St,+New+York,+NY+10012/@40.7259294,-73.9968293,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c259855fdd5293:0xd39ec45d9866811e!8m2!3d40.7259294!4d-73.9946406&quot;&gt;Lafayette St&lt;/a&gt; in NYC.

			<description>A longtime blogging friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danconover.com/&quot;&gt;Dan Conover&lt;/a&gt; is writing on Facebook these days, which is a shame, because his best pieces get me thinking enough that I want to write my own post that expands on his thinking, like the one he wrote the other day about splitting the US in two. Dan lives in South Carolina. Former journalist. I met him on my visit to Spartanberg in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/02/15.html&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a great auto tour through the south. I learned a lot at every stop. So Dan wrote that the problems of the US are much bigger than a terrible choice for president in 2016, it has to do with the compromise that was made at the beginning of the country when it was just 3 million people (today's population of Oklahoma) because they built a country around two very different economies and cultures -- agrarian and urban. It's only grown more pronounced in 2019. We just can't live together. The US needs a Brexit. Of course we aren't going to get one (it's impossible). I wish you could read his whole piece.</description>
