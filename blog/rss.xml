			<description>What I need for Node.js hosting in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/14/whatINeedForNodeHosting.m4a&quot;&gt;3.5 minute podcast&lt;/a&gt;. A big folder with lots of sub-folders, each of which is an app -- containing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodesource.com/blog/the-basics-of-package-json-in-node-js-and-npm/&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/a&gt; file, a node_modules folder, all code, data. You figure out how to host them on servers, I don't care. It works like Dropbox, keeps the folders in sync with the running apps it's managing. I can write dashboards that run on my desktop that keep track of what's going on in the folders. You figure out how much resources I use and I pay for it.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/btaylor&quot;&gt;Bret Taylor&lt;/a&gt; is the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/1205262855861235713&quot;&gt;COO&lt;/a&gt; of Salesforce. This is notable because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor&quot;&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1205509575862083591&quot;&gt;real developer&lt;/a&gt;. He led the development of Google Maps, then started FriendFeed, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+FriendFeed&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;we used&lt;/a&gt;. It was acquired by Facebook where he became CTO and FriendFeed became the user interface of Facebook, the one we use today. He's created a lot of products, all excellent, timely and hugely popular. Having him lead a company like Salesforce is unusual, perhaps even unprecedented. A lot of tech CEOs have product backgrounds, but none as deep as Taylor. Salesforce also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, which is as far as I know unique and under-used. A simple way of hosting Node apps. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;used it&lt;/a&gt; for a few years myself, until it became &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/05/12/whyIMovedOffHeroku.html&quot;&gt;uneconomical&lt;/a&gt;. If they were aggressive with it and invested, they could challenge Amazon and Google in hosting. Maybe they already do. Taylor has the depth and background to do some very consequential stuff at Salesforce. We'll be watching. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Trump is part of an organization like that. Possibly Lavrov gave him a briefing, like the CIA tries to give him briefings. In the book was a top ten concern of Putin: climate change activism.

			<description>One thing Facebook could do is provide a clean URL to point into Facebook, without any spyware, so FB posts can be part of the open web. A link into Facebook should be a safe thing. They're always saying how they want to make the web safer. So this has a double benefit. Help the web, and keep people safe.</description>

			<title>Right wing nut jobs of Nashville</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At a BloggerCon-like conference in Nashville. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/05/07.html&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. My session was occupied by a small number of right wing Rush Limbaugh fans. All men, as you might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were complaining no one was listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was the moderator. I pointed out to the nth guy to complain -- you know everyone is listening to you right now. Didn't matter, someone else started complaining about the same thing. They just kept saying the same words over and over. As today, their main point was their grievance.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My response was this: &quot;I can't tell you why there aren't more right wing nut jobs here, best I can do is listen and empathize and then move on to the next person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The former United States</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you think of the United States as a company, we've had a strategic partnership with Russia for the last three years, kind of like the one Microsoft had with IBM. Russia is analogous to Microsoft. They're about to roll over us in the 2020 election. Our last gasp is the impeachment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should have had this confrontation sooner, we would have had a better chance of prevailing. Going back to the Electoral College vote in 2016. We could have briefed the electors on the misdeeds of the Trump campaign in collusion with Russia. We could have had nightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/16/december19IsABigDay.html&quot;&gt;candlelight vigils&lt;/a&gt; in the state capitals where the electoral votes would be cast. We could have at least honored the passing of a political system that kind of worked and provided us with an incredible standard of living, and hosted the development of the Internet, won the space race, and Woodstock and the Mets! Saved my family. I wouldn't exist without the US and probably neither would you. We could have been serious about resisting right from that point, instead as with all the points at which we could have acted, we hoped somehow this would blow over without us having to disrupt our lives. We're a lazy, fat culture, Russia knows and is taking full advantage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway back to the tech analogy. Impeachment is like IBM shipping OS/2 and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=micro+channel+architecture&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Micro Channel Architecture&lt;/a&gt;. Both were designed to rid IBM of Microsoft once and for all. But it didn't work. It was too little too late. Microsoft came out with Windows 3.0, and IBM became a global consulting company. The company that dominated the computer business left the computer business.

There may still be a few courageous defectors to the Rule-of-Law Party, but unless there's a great awakening in the Senate, the courts, DoJ, the military and other branches of service, Putin has the power to put down impeachment, and from there, will complete the replication of the political system of Russia in the US, where political opponents are jailed or assassinated, as with uncooperative journalists. This is about to happen in the US, but journalism and discourse on the net has yet to catch up.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Putin could really fuck with us (but probably won't), and instruct McConnell to have a change of heart and the Senate votes to remove Trump. What an opportunity to screw up the US for a few generations, if not longer. From this point we're never going to know what's actually going on, we don't really know now (btw), but it's going to get a lot worse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wheeee!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've had a chance to think more about Twitter's surprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; to come up with a web standard that turns Twitter into a protocol. I'm guessing the practical reason for this is so that Twitter can no longer be held responsible for abuse. They could ask Trump, for example, to host his own twitter, and people could subscribe to it anywhere, including Jack's twitter. It's basically a return to the open web after 13 years as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo&quot;&gt;silo&lt;/a&gt; that's been sucking the life out of the open web. I don't see why anyone but Twitter and its shareholders would go for this. I am still hoping Twitter, for the good of the web and the world, would expand to attach and display data from blogging software, as they attach and display video and images. That way writing beyond 280 chars with titles, links, simple styling can flourish. Same with podcasts. Twitter improves at a glacial pace, and they're hogging the fast lane of web media, of course along wtih the other silos.</description>

			<description>Follow-up: Now that (I think) I understand Twitter's goal, what they really want is a way to have a feed be hooked into a Twitter &quot;location.&quot; So one could follow, for example:  @whitehouse.gov:donaldtrump, and it would get updates from that server. &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; would totally be able to do it.</description>

			<description>I wonder how many people know that Facebook turned off its most basic API after the 2016 election. Got no press, there's no developer memory of it. It's as if all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_crossings_of_the_Hudson_River&quot;&gt;Hudson crossings&lt;/a&gt; to NYC were shut down permanently, only bigger because the population of Facebook is billions not millions. Twitter on the other hand shut down a portion of its APIs in 2012 and it put an indelible mark on the reputation of the company with developers. I personally forgave them because I anticipated it, I've been down this road many times, on both sides.</description>

			<title>What about Mastodon?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So, what about Mastodon? It does everything, right? I'm sure, but Twitter is where the people are and that's what matters. This happens all the time in tech, people think the solution is to rebuild something from scratch with the feature we wish the default platform would have. It isn't about the feature as much as where the feature is. I have a blogging system that's way more fun that Twitter and has none of its limits. BFD, the people use Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the mistake people who created Atom made, they thought what if we had invented RSS instead of the messy process by which RSS was created, we'll do it the right way and it'll be wonderful. Then they finished and no one knew what to do next. I'm sure they were very proud but unless they can get everyone who already supported RSS to go back and reimplement their support, we all still have to support RSS. And it's one of those things that no matter how much better it is, people will ask &quot;Is everyone doing this&quot; and if the answer is no, they do something else they have to do, putting out fires etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another example, if I have to go to NYC I take the George Washington Bridge or the Holland or Lincoln Tunnels. I'd much rather take the Golden Gate Bridge, it's so much nicer, but it doesn't go where I want to go! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106&quot;&gt;outlines&lt;/a&gt; a plan to fund a small independent team to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media, a standard that Twitter would support. I advocate something different, Twitter already has the bugs and scaling issues solved for a global notification network. Let's add a few APIs and create a new universe. It'll happen a lot faster with much better results imho. Interestingly I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/03.html#a151621&quot;&gt;podcast on just this topic&lt;/a&gt;, a week ago today.</description>

			<description>I've been down the road Jack proposes to take Twitter down, it's fraught with problems. Social media has been around a long time and there are plenty of competing standards for integrating platforms. Had they proposed such a standard when they were starting Twitter, no one would have cared, and it would have had a chance of working. Now it's a huge industry with lots at stake and lots of entities that would like to keep it from standardizing. Now maybe Jack knows this, and it's meant as a PR thing, and I'm sure the press will love it. Until they forget about it. It's time for a &lt;i&gt;proprietary&lt;/i&gt; approach, one that is open to cloning. That can work because there's a single decision-making entity. If their goal really is to create a standard they can do it, much the way we created standards for content syndication when our product dominated. Waiting for an open development group to synthesize something that can be broadly supported, well I suppose it could happen, but it rarely does.</description>

			<description>Suppose you're a retiring Republican congressperson and you're retiring because you don't like where we're going. Why not denounce Trump? You're not seeking re-election. Hard to escape what's obvious. There's more to the story we're not hearing about.</description>

			<description>Cabbage soup: Boil 1/2 gallon of water in a big pot. Brown onions, garlic, cabbage, add to boiling water. Add carrots, chunks of white or red potatos. Brown some kind of meat, whatever you like, in stew-size chunks. I went with some chuck, not an expensive grade, this is for soup, all the toughness is going to be boiled out. Make sure it has sufficient fat to add richness to the soup. Add seasoning, I like basil, oregano, hot pepper. A can of chopped tomatoes. As much as a cup of wine vinegar, to taste. Cook for a few hours with low heat. Let it sit overnight, then cook another couple of hours. Reheat whenever you want a delicious bowl of hot soup. You don't have to add anything, it's got everything you need. I like a very cold glass of ice water with it. My father used to make this soup.</description>

			<description>During the impeachment hearings it would be &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; if MSNBC or CNN had an hour every night that were just verbatim highlights from the day's hearings, no expert commentary. I can't afford to watch all day, but I do want to know what happens. One hour is about right. Even better, a podcast.</description>

			<title>Hidden files in PagePark</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagepark&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; is becoming a serious web server. Just wanted to say that. The docs make it sound like a one-off hack for easily hosting parked domains. It was that, at the start, about five years ago. Over time I've been adding features, and trying to keep the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/pagepark.js&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; readable and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/config.md&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; up to date. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today's problem -- hidden files and folders.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to be able to put data, scripts, development notes for a site with the site itself. When you're managing as many domains as I am, economies like that may prevent things from getting lost, or having version mismatches. At the same time, I want control over what people will see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first plan was to use . as Apache and nginx do. I implemented it and started to set up a test case, and found immediately why this wouldn't work. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/09/macErrorMessage.png&quot;&gt;Mac OS&lt;/a&gt;, which I use on my primary machine, uses a . at the beginning of a file name to hide a file or folder. I know I can create such files with a script or at the command line, but the point is to be able to hide stuff from web users that I can see myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next I went with # as the special character. It's what we used in Frontier's &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1006&quot;&gt;website framework&lt;/a&gt;. But when I tried to test it the browser chops off everything after the # which is awkward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then Philip Borenstein &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pborenstein/status/1204076780191191041&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that Jekyll and other static site generators use underscore to indicate a hidden file or folder. I'm guessing that will work because they had to fit in with both browsers and operating systems, as PagePark does. I'm going to go with that for a bit and see if I'm happy with the way it goes. Respecting &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt; is always a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All this started with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1204059284662837251&quot;&gt;developer poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&quot;He was caught trying to steal the 2020 election.&quot; That's what I want the Articles of Impeachment to say. That sends the message through the ages that at least the Democrats thought this was a problem. If the republic survives, of course that's the end of the Republican Party. I don't see how the stakes, for the world (Ukraine isn't part of the US) could be larger. BTW, I highly recommend listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/12/05/785134051/what-ukraines-president-thinks-of-trump-putin-the-impeachment-hearings&quot;&gt;Fresh Air hour&lt;/a&gt; about the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Very interesting story told by an American reporter who has had access. One thing came out in the Fresh Air story -- in Ukraine, the Trump impeachment of isn't big news. Due to their location at the front between the constitutional US govt and the Russian-dominated one, they couldn't be more a part of the US if they were Hawaii.</description>

			<description>One of the boxes I received the other day from Berkeley contains backups going back to Madison in 1979. All different kinds of media. I'm optimistic that I'll be able to find a CD drive that works with my Mac and (at least) reads the backups I took in the 90s. For the others I might have to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://computerhistory.org/&quot;&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly an equivalent setup in NYC or Boston.</description>

			<title>Finding MailToTheFuture</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email from a longtime reader who wanted to know what became of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22mail+to+the+future%22+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Mail To The Future&lt;/a&gt;. He said he sent an email to himself twenty years ago and would like to read it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I feel so irresponsible, when you create a site like that you're pretty much obligated to keep it running. But the contents of the database, if I was any good at backups, is on one of those CDs. I will put the time in at some point to try to restore the app. It should be relatively easy to port to Node. And I can easily export the data out of a root file. I still have &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; running on my modern iMac. I use it all the time. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I still have &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailtothefuture.com/&quot;&gt;the domain&lt;/a&gt;, and put a placeholder page there. And the source code. It's backed up, a little, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19991003043305/http://www.mailtothefuture.com:80/public/logon&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. What I haven't found yet is the all-important data. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Something really weird. I watch MSNBC at least one hour every night. The first ads for a presidential candidate I’ve seen are in the last few days and they’re all from Bloomberg. Why didn’t any of the other candidates advertise to me? They advertise to me on the net, mostly to get me to give them money. A TV ad for a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020 is still a novelty and if the ad is good, it can do more than motivate donations. People want to be inspired. TV advertising done well can do that. Bloomberg's ads check all the boxes. They're winning ads.</description>

			<description>I can't stop watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds/status/1203118775815622664&quot;&gt;this ad&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aviationgin.com/&quot;&gt;Aviation Gin&lt;/a&gt;. Three hot and emotive women at a bar, facing the camera. There's a plot, character development, non-verbal communication, lots to watch. The music is kind of funny. Something happened before this meetup and something will happen after. But this moment is very lovely, and that's why I find it so hard to move on.</description>

			<description>The XML-RPC spec looks really good, ported to GitHub and Markdown. A lot of people still use XML-RPC, even though REST was supposed to be so much better. With a JavaScript reference implementation and new debugging tools, we may find there's new life in the community. Or at the very least, it'll be ready for the next 21 years.  &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'm doing a reboot of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; website and readying a new JavaScript implementation. I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/frontierPointer.png&quot;&gt;reminded&lt;/a&gt; that the original reference implementation, in 1998, was in UserLand Frontier. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/reference/xml/xmlRpc/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; are still there. 21 years. Not bad.</description>

			<description>Nancy Pelosi (not a boomer, she was born in 1940) was great yesterday, both in her press conference where she said what is sure to be a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/dec/05/dont-mess-with-me-nancy-pelosi-responds-to-reporter-asking-if-she-hates-trump-video&quot;&gt;historic line&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Don't mess with me&quot; all the way to the CNN town hall, which I watched, where she asked not to have to look at things through the prism of the White House, which as long as Trump is there is crazy town. She's the leader we didn't know we had. What I admire most about her is her clarity and her ability to think on her feet. Either that or she really prepared for this moment. No matter, she's just what we need right now. A strong woman to stand up to Trump. That's his Kryptonite.</description>
