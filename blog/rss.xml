			<title>Elizabeth Warren for VP</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Biden should pick &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; for VP.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She'd put Repubs on notice. Biden is a nice guy but Warren knows you suck. Good cop bad cop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A black woman? The best candidate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters&quot;&gt;Maxine Waters&lt;/a&gt;, isn't in contention.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's win, not just the election but the politcal war that will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I supported Biden over Warren after Klobuchar dropped out. I want a president that is uncontentious, for everyone. A unifier. It's the only way out of the paralysis imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I want everyone to understand the unity has as its foundation care for the American people. That's what Warren is for. No one can misunderstand what that choice means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>When will there be a vaccine?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a splash of cold water.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've been sort of assuming that there will be immunity and eventually a vaccine for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&quot;&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it may be that neither will happen.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There isn't a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/potential-future-options/hiv-vaccines&quot;&gt;vaccine for HIV&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It first appeared in 1984. 36 years. That would mean there would be no Covid-19 vaccine in 2056.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Something to think about and ponder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also there's another apocalypse lurking in the shadows, other than climate change. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/about/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html&quot;&gt;Antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yeah science is a bitch. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The ridiculousness of Trump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Take a step back and think about the ridiculousness of Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world is shut down. Economic and health collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Precarious future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We hope science is working, trying to dig us out of the mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we never get updates on that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just more Trump garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually we're going to have to get down to business. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all stuck in hibernation until we get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And this clown is up there being an idiot. And now everyone is looking. And day after day of idiot lectures and babbles incoherently. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then he talks about injecting bleach in your veins. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How much more of this could we possibly take. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/24/171026.html?title=aMilestoneInAmericanJournalism&quot;&gt;the NYT can't see both sides&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Something broke there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>More men die from Covid than women. Older people and people with other problems like heart disease, diabetes, hypertension make up a large share of the deaths. From that, we conclude that people in these groups are more likely to die than not if they get the virus. But that's not a logical inference. I'd love to hear the numbers expressed the other way. If you have some or all of these conditions, and you get the disease, what's the probability that you will die.</description>

			<title>Dropbox is killing itself</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Dropbox on Linux appears to be killing itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I do a &quot;dropbox status&quot; from the command line, it says: &quot;Upgrading Dropbox...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It never stops trying to upgrade itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It isn't syncing while supposedly upgrading. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Upgrading+Dropbox...%22&amp;t=hy&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;searched&lt;/a&gt; and on various support boards that this has been happening for years for others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems I spend a week every few months nursing Dropbox back to health, usually by lopping off big pieces of my Dropbox archive. It might be time to try something new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A milestone in American journalism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The NYT isn't punting on whether drinking or injecting poison is bad for a human. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1253719616603541504&quot;&gt;taking a stand&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There aren't two sides to that, per the NYT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No he-said-she-said. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not subject to alternate facts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; agree to disagree. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am not being sarcastic. This is how bad it has been. They've accepted as reality lies that have cost us dearly. Two sides to ridiculous things that are not two-sided. Finally they have been pushed to the brink of their cowardice by a psychotic president who insists that ingesting random poisons could cure a person of the disease caused by the pandemic that is consuming our country. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NYT and Trump were in perfect sync on the possibility of this idea being true until now. Let's hope they come to their senses and start showing a bit of the courage and integrity that they take so much credit for having. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Times takes a stand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Walking on country roads</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In the country north of NYC where I now live, we're seeing an influx of city folk, staying at their summer homes or using AirBnB's or whatever. And of course they're getting out and walking on our beautiful roads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But some of them bring their aggressive city walking habits with them, something I'm very familiar with because I also know how to walk &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/11/27.html#a203503&quot;&gt;in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, learned the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are some common-sense rules for walking on country roads.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Wear a mask.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Walk on the side of the road, not in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Pick a side of the road to walk on and stick with it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're in a group of say four people, don't walk four-across. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Leave room for people to pass you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remember cars and bikes use country roads too. :-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If someone is walking faster, as they approach (assuming you hear them) slow down a little, or stop, to make the passing faster. Stay slow until they are a few yards ahead, so you minimize the breathing their exhaled viruses. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I offer this advice because a few people are walking like there is no pandemic and their breath is free of virus and they're assuming so is everyone else's. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Working my way through the last season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;. It's great, but the most striking thing are the ads. When the first show aired, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/23.html&quot;&gt;February 23&lt;/a&gt;, there was no awareness of the virus in advertising. As the season progressed, at times I forgot I was watching something from nine weeks ago. An ad for a bank that has turned itself into a coffee shop. Whoa that's optimistic, I thought to myself, and then realized this was the old reality. The full series makes a very interesting window into the transition our culture is making. I'm reminded of when my mom died, we didn't do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/04.html#a070909&quot;&gt;video walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; of the house we grew up in. Didn't think of it, because it seemed normal to be there, not realizing soon this would all be gone, and in the future it would be anything but normal. Now we're repeating it on a much much larger scale. When this show turns up on Netflix it won't have the ads, and we'll miss the transition, which is in every way as interesting as the show, which as I said is fantastic.</description>

			<description>Ever notice how I put images in the right margin of posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;? That tradition goes all the way back to the mid-90s. I'm always looking for evocative images that aren't too large, that have empty backgrounds. Imagine how happy I was when I discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://psddd.co/free-web-font-people-silhouettes/&quot;&gt;Wee People font&lt;/a&gt;. A collection of silhouettes of people gesturing in easily identified ways. I admit I'm making this post extra long so there's room to put one of the images in the right margin. Please forgive me. Now I wonder which one I should use? Let's see. How about a person of indeterminate gender talking on a phone?</description>

			<title>More science in the news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Petitions don't work for politics, but they may work for media. If I started a petition to ask CNN and MSNBC to limit Trump coverage to 1 hour per night, would you sign it? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think MSNBC and CNN should stop focusing on Trump so much.

What should we do now? I know testing, testing, testing, but that's like saying baseball, baseball, baseball. The way we test, what we test for, that's something people should learn about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Coverage of the outbreaks should be like weather reporting. The more we know, and the more we see progress being made, the more hope can take over from fatalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see journalism as starting to separate from Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I predict that on the day he resigns in disgrace it will not be the #1 story of the day. Probably won't even be #2. That gives an idea of how much we have to change the focus to news that really matters not the latest fake controversy Trump offers us to distract from our future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was going to write a bit about Kobol vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/wheres-my-check-cobol-unemployment-and-taxes/&quot;&gt;COBOL&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient programming language which is in the news these days. Kobol is the homeworld of the Twelve Colonies in Battlestar Galactica. I've watched the full series twice. But the synopsis on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; is riveting. I often forget how simple and beautiful the overall structure of the plot is. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/21/bsgplot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spSpoiler&quot;&gt;BSG plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And of course the execution. I'd have to say, even though it has cheezy sets and special effects, it's pretty much a perfect multi-part scifi drama. I just watched The Expanse, which is also good, but BSG is still tops with me.</description>

			<description>I took a survey class in programming languages in grad school, and COBOL was of course one of them. It was in the mid-late 70s when people were still creating new systems in COBOL. It was one of the first attempts to make programming like English instead of like programming, so managers could do it, you wouldn't need programmers. To anyone who really knew about programming, it was obvious that this would not work. People would want features for which there were no human language equivalents, like looping and recursion, nesting, local variables, procedures, closures, objects, async, etc etc. We keep discovering new concepts for which you can't say &quot;this is just like..&quot; COBOL may have been the first programming language to reject programming, but it was not the last. Later attempts include Hypercard and AppleScript. I'm sure there were many others. I've always been most comfortable with Algol-like languages, C, Pascal, JavaScript. My own invented language, UserTalk, is Algol-like. There is a grammar somewhere for UserTalk. I'll find it later. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>The ebb and flow of lockdown</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The way we're going to fight the virus is like levels in video games. You don't get to move on to the next level until you've mastered the previous. And when you fall down, you go back to the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This narrative comes from listening to expert explainers on MSNBC last night, mainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/the-pandemics-path/&quot;&gt;Laurie Garrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;, who was also yesterday's guest on the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;Daily&lt;/a&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, establish strategic testing. Do statistical sampling to form virus outbreak &quot;weather reports,&quot; like tracking tornados. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you are in an area where there aren't active outbreaks, you can do a covid-aware resumption of business. Strict limits on size and density of gatherings, so new outbreaks, which will happen, are limited. Makes contact tracing possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Where there are outbreaks, do intense contact tracing. Full lockdown except for essential services. Locate people who are infected, and isolate with other spreaders, not with their families. Until the outbreak subsides, then go to 2. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The testing is never of the whole population, always sampled, and to support contact tracing. Testing forms the basis for the weather reports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are going to get very good at all this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NateSilver538&quot;&gt;Nate Silver&lt;/a&gt; can explain better and in more detail. This is similar to what they do at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/politics/&quot;&gt;538&lt;/a&gt; to predict election outcomes. It's also similar to what they do with TV program ratings for advertising, and gathering meteorological data to support weather forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Chuck Shotton suggested I look at the Node package &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/require-from-string&quot;&gt;require-from-string&lt;/a&gt; as a good basis for plugins for Node apps. I had done &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/docs/plugins.md&quot;&gt;something similar&lt;/a&gt; with plain old require. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/3e5454f2b7a10029dfc301d7deabb576&quot;&gt;Hello World app&lt;/a&gt; I wrote to get an idea how I might use it.</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lilienfeld1/status/1251335135909122049&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from a epidemiologist saying there isn't enough awareness of the damage the virus causes people who survive. It's like the mass shootings. They only count those who were killed. But some people are so damaged they never get to resume anything like a normal life. We'll be living with the (still unknown) after-effects of Covid-19 for a long time to come.</description>

			<description>I record shows I love so I can binge-watch them on my own schedule. Last night I watched the first episode of season 5 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amc.com/shows/better-call-saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;What's bad about these &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/residents-protest-coronavirus-stay-home-orders-states/story?id=70233220&quot;&gt;demos&lt;/a&gt; is that it shows a commitment with some Americans to have an idiot government, no matter the cost financially or in terms of human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, &quot;re-opening&quot; America is a losing strategy from both perspectives. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/24/21192638/coronavirus-bill-gates-trump-reopen-business&quot;&gt;Bill Gates said&lt;/a&gt; no one is going to want to go to a restaurant or buy a house with piles of bodies all over the place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It could be that restaurants as a concept are over, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The big failing of the press is they are making an excellent issue of Trump's failure to act in January and February, meanwhile it's almost May, and Trump's government is &lt;i&gt;still failing to act. &lt;/i&gt;Which has bigger impact? Past failures or the ones happening right now?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately few journalists cover the failings of journalism, and most are on the payroll of journalism, so they tend to pull their punches.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;One year ago today I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/20/151133.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Those who say impeach is not the answer, what would Trump have to do in order to make impeach the right answer?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Well here's the thing, what makes you think he won't do much worse between now and inauguration day in 2021?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He wouldn't have any restraints between now and then.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And BTW, what constraints would there be on the next president? Maybe not such a buffoon as Trump. If we don't impeach and remove, we no longer have a Constitution that's enforced re the president. This guy has been ignoring it. We would all be ignoring it if he isn't impeached and removed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Question about &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;. I know there have been concerns about its &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=zoom+mac+security+issues&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;. Is it safe to install on a Mac? Please answer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1251851837898215424&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>A couple of nights ago I dreamed I was still a smoker, and felt guilty about lying to everyone that I had stopped. In the dream I'm going from store to store looking for my brand. It's so weird, I quit 6519 days ago. Not one cigarette in all that time. So why in my subconscious do I feel like a loser for cheating?</description>

			<title>Is the virus here?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I find it helpful to ask the question &quot;Is the virus here?&quot; I thought on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/08.html&quot;&gt;March 8&lt;/a&gt; it must not be here yet. I had a dinner party that night. Lots of touching, no social distancing. Some people from the small town I live in, some from NYC. Should have been more careful. But it's now 41 days later, and all the guests at the party are well. So I guess we dodged a bullet. On that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, when I go for a walk, or go to the market, I ask the same question and assume the answer is yes. The virus is here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How do I keep it out of my lungs?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In server programming there's this idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking&quot;&gt;tainted text&lt;/a&gt;. If it came from outside the server, it could contain executable code. That's how hackers get into our systems, through tainted text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I think about packages from Amazon the same way. I have a physical-world untaint function. I leave them alone for 24 hours. I've heard that the virus will die on cardboard in 24 hours. I assume whatever is inside the box is not dirty, but I think of it as tainted too. It came from outside. It's tainted. I wash my hands after handling it. Then at some point I shrug my shoulders and bless it as part of the house, and not tainted. It's how I maintain a level of sanity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/reference/manila/macros/safeMacrosGuidelines&quot;&gt;excellent guide&lt;/a&gt; to being safe with macros in Frontier, many years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find a lot of parallels between programming and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology&quot;&gt;epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;. We've been dealing with similar concerns ever since our software started communicating over the open network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Maybe the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66CP-pq7Cx0&quot;&gt;best end&lt;/a&gt; of any &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_%26_Louise&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; ever. It's now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/18/thelmaLouiseEnd.png&quot;&gt;header&lt;/a&gt; image &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/18.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't like the picture that was there &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/26/lake.png&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, but spring hasn't happened here yet, and until then I have nothing to replace it with. Thelma and Louise should be the default header here, as it is the permanent one on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;. BTW, I've been meaning to say this, if you want to get the most out of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; you should have an account on Twitter so you can, for example, go there and vote in the polls. Twitter has a useful set of functionality, and they let me use their API and identity system for $0. Pretty good deal. You don't have to do it of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>
