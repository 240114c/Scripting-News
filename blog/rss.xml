			<description>Just got home. Amazing connections on arriving. New concourse at Penn Station, very confusing. Followed one of the paths, was hoping to get on the 1 train uptown, but the concourse took me right to the platform for the A train. WTF. So I went upstairs, and as I was reaching the platform an uptown A pulls in. I get on. A seat is waiting for me. I get off the train, walk to my building and an elevator opens, I get in and it takes me right up to my apartment. From the Acela to my living room, about 10 minutes. Couldn't possibly have happened any faster. Sometimes, rarely, NYC &quot;just works&quot; as we say in the software biz.</description>

			<description>I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/can-you-ever-forgive-me&quot;&gt;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&lt;/a&gt; last night. It was as reviewed, excellent. Melissa McCarthy is a phenomenal actress, you get total suspension of disbelief, except for a few instants scattered throughout where they remind you she is one of the best comics of our day. The theme is self-knowledge. Running away from yourself until you can't, and that's when life begins. Must-see.</description>

			<description>Following up on yesterday's project. I now have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/freeDiskSpace&quot;&gt;new app&lt;/a&gt; running on each of my servers. Every minute, they find out how much space is free on the system disk, and the result is written to a file on S3. There's a file for each server. A central app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/serverMonitor&quot;&gt;serverMonitor&lt;/a&gt;, reads those files and stores the data in a file it generates that's then displayed by a JS app running in the browser. The net result, now I see an up to date report on disk space on all my servers any time I want. So the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/12/05/184016.html&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; we had with &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, hopefully should not happen again. In the process I found out that people are using features I had basically forgotten were in the product. Yikes. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Beard_(executive)&quot;&gt;Chris Beard&lt;/a&gt; at Mozilla wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/06/goodbye-edge/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; that I totally agree with about the problem of Google dominance of the open web. I could have written that piece myself. In fact in a way I &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;. But Mozilla hasn't listened any better than Google. Maybe if we want to keep the thread of a free web alive, we should listen better, and &lt;i&gt;help each other. &lt;/i&gt;That was the original spirit of the web, not the dominance of big companies who don't feel obligated to listen to and work with individuals. To me, Mozilla looks as big as Google looks to them.</description>

			<description>I think this is the problem everywhere you look, in politics, journalism, tech, education, business -- organizations dominating individuals. That's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; is so refreshing. One of us crashed the party. We hope that opens to door for more party-crashing. That, btw, was the great thing about the web when it came along. The tech industry was just as mired in bigco dominance as it is today. But the web paid no respect to their dominance. In come the people. I remember, I was there. I took advantage of the new opportunities.</description>

			<description>BTW, one of the reasons I find it so easy to remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;AOC's&lt;/a&gt; initials because it is also the name of a nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://aocnyc.com/&quot;&gt;French restaurant&lt;/a&gt; I like to go to in the West Village.</description>

			<description>People are so critical about how Facebook makes them feel. But that's just one part of it. If you work in a place by yourself, having FB or Twitter around is like having a water cooler to go take a break at. You reach a stopping point, you want to clear your head, so you go do something chatty for a bit. They work. If they didn't exist you'd have to invent them (which of course we did).</description>

			<description>BTW, back in the old days we'd need a break (using a BBS or CompuServe, then and later AppleLink) because compilations took so long. It could be as much as ten minutes. Then builds got fast, then instantaneous. And of course now we have Dropbox which is sometimes as slow at syncing servers as the old compilers were at building an executable. Same as it ever was.</description>

			<description>Today I'm going to build a Node app that finds out how much space is available on the system disk and writes the result to a location on S3. This will allow my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/serverMonitor&quot;&gt;serverMonitor&lt;/a&gt; app to periodically read those files and present them in a tabular form. I have to have an easy way to see if one of my servers has run out of space. Not sure exactly how I'm going to approach it. Update: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/freeDiskSpace/blob/master/freediskspace.js&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;. It only works on Unix. I send a command to the shell asking it to run the DF command, get the result, and write the stats to S3. serverMonitor has been updated to look for the files for the server, and it shows me a table with the percentage free space. Problem solved.</description>

			<title>Server outage report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;1:42PM Eastern: I've received several notes from users of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; that the app isn't responding. I looked into it and found that the server it's running on has a full disk. Log files overflowing. Still haven't got a systematic way to deal with that. I just removed all the old log files and now the server has a lot of free space. It'll take a few minutes for everything to come back online, hopefully. Will report here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2:45PM: I think I have the server put back together after the outage. If you have any trouble running &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/104&quot;&gt;report it here&lt;/a&gt;. If you can, open the JavaScript console and look for error messages in red and include what you see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It's interesting to me, as an observer, to see Automattic go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://davisshaver.com/2018/12/04/why-last-nights-surprise-announcement-of-wordpress-5-0-was-a-concerning-decision-by-matt-mullenweg/&quot;&gt;kinds of pains&lt;/a&gt; we went through years ago when releasing major versions of Frontier. It happened in 1998 when we released the first version that ran on Windows in addition to the Mac. And again when we shipped Radio UserLand with integrated blogging and RSS. These should have been times of celebration, and in earlier efforts before we did all our work on the net, they would have. I am impressed with the way the users express their concerns, because (I'm guessing) they have businesses with customers who are going  to be confused. And the angst is probably amplified because the leader of the WordPress community is so accessible. That was the conclusion I came to about the trouble we got for shipping. There's always a reaction among users and developers on new platform releases. Imagine if Steve Jobs had been as accessible as Matt Mullenweg when Apple shipped a version of Mac OS that breaks apps. But he wasn't. In general the leaders of these efforts are insulated through layers and layers. It takes guts for Matt to put himself out there. And at the same time, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1069930276829179904&quot;&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; of his users are legit.</description>

			<title>New stuff to Like</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Changes to Likes&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblikes.org/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; to tie all this stuff together and a new domain, weblikes.org.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/client/&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt; is nice, but it was complex. We needed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/nodelikes/helloworld/&quot;&gt;Hello World app&lt;/a&gt;, so now there is one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples/helloWorld&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; provided, of course. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now that there are two example apps, the repository needed a new organization. There's now an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples&quot;&gt;examples folder&lt;/a&gt; at the top level, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/api&quot;&gt;JavaScript API&lt;/a&gt; is in its own folder. Code to include it must change as well. This is exemplified in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/tree/master/examples&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;New options for the JavaScript API: 1. You can omit the word &quot;likes,&quot; as we do on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, and 2. Have the Like bits appended instead of prepended. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/blob/master/examples/helloWorld/code.js&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; in the Hello World app to see how they're set.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Various CSS edits that allow the environment defaults to rule the rendering of Likes as opposed to having the values hard-coded in the CSS for likes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were breaking changes in this release. if you've already deployed, sorry. I haven't heard from anyone who has. If you're depending on this toolkit, great. (No sarcasm.) Please provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/likes/issues/1&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; on the changes and make suggestions or just say hi. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Praises Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Calls Melania and tells her he loves her. Fires his children. Signs resignation letter.</description>
