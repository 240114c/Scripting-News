# Stories on GitHub
Over the weekend I tried out an idea I had been thinking about for a while. It's a little Node app that runs on the same server as the CMS that builds this blog, a static site generator called Old School. 

Every minute it looks at today's posts, for those that have titles (like the post your'e reading now), it checks if it changed, and if so it renders it as Markdown and uploads it to GitHub in a calendar-based structure, along-side all the other parts of the blog I upload to GitHub.  I like using GitHub this way, I have a feeling it'd make a good shared object database, once I learn how to use it this way.

I've been hand-generating links to the GitHub version to get you all thinking about this idea, like this.

I did this based on an assumption that I would be able to figure out a way to make it possible for any of my posts to become a sub-project on GitHub. I'm not saying any of them would become projects, only now it would be possible. I thought this might work well with the new email distribution system which has stimulated so much discussion. 

I'm not sure this is going to work, but I'm trying an idea out. :rocket:
