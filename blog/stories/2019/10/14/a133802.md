# Customized searching
I've been emailing with my old friend Dave Carlick about customized searching. I've also been writing about it here. I'm not sure I've made my point, but now I have an excellent example that might shed some light. Dave, take note.
* I just searched Google for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=" old+school""="">Old School</a>.
* It came back with pointers to a 2003 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_(film)">movie</a> of that name. A Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OldSchoolMovie/">group</a> with that name. A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old-school">dictionary</a> definition. The <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=old%20school">urban dictionary</a> version. And on and on.
* But I have a product named <a href="https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog">Old School</a>. I've written about it on my blog a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+" old+school""="">bunch</a> of times. If Google knew I was the author of this blog, it would also know that when I search for Old School, I want to see my product first, because in all likelihood that's what I'm looking for. 

That's what I mean about associating the searcher with the searcher's blog.
