# I don't like any of them
I watched some of the debate last night, flipping channels between MSNBC, the American League Championship Series, Law and Order.

 I wish they had asked Warren the question about marriage being between a man and a woman, to see if we'd get the same snotty male-bashing answer. Watching Warren be so sincere in this debate knowing that underneath it all she's an asshole spoils the effect. I was ready to declare the primary over, Warren is the candidate, but not any more. 

I really want Amy Klobuchar, and she was better this time, but as I've said before, she doesn't shine in this environment. Biden, forget it. He never was that good, and now he's pathetic, and so is Kamala Harris, and Mayor Pete is nice but let's wait a few years and see if he can be Senator Pete or Governor Pete first.

Bernie would be a disaster, though he showed heart in thanking people for their support in his time of need. 

Why can't the Democrats find someone with experience, not too old, confident, and just a Democrat. I'm not interested right now in revolutionizing anything beyond restoring the revolution we had in 1776.
