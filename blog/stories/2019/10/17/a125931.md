I had a <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/25.html#a135230">bike accident</a> a little over 3 weeks ago. Broke a rib, am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGlo9LzmOME">getting</a> over it. It takes a long time for a rib to heal. This is the second time I've had the rib-breaking kind of bike accident. Last time I broke multiple ribs on both sides. This time it was only one rib but it really broke. I thought for a while I'd have to get surgery to repair it, but it's fixing itself. Makes breathing hard and sleep comes in spurts, I haven't slept through the night since it happened.
