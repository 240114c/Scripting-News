I was 14. Lived in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/29-31+170th+St,+Flushing,+NY+11358/@40.769637,-73.7970707,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c28a80780e9c3b:0xa8668e9b256999a4!8m2!3d40.769637!4d-73.794882">Flushing</a>, mowed the lawns of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets&t=h_&ia=web">Mets</a> players. Loved them when they lost, was rewarded for the trust. Iâ€™ve believed in miracles my whole life thanks to the example of the 1969 Mets.
