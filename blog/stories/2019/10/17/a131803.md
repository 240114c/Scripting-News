The web is like one of the big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_oak">live oak</a> trees in my yard in my old <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/425+Manzanita+Way,+Woodside,+CA+94062/@37.419135,-122.2471517,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa438d2e58d87:0x6c0dbc392cc6bf79!8m2!3d37.419135!4d-122.244963">Woodside, CA</a> house. Soaking in the hot tub, I would say to the nearby tree "I own you." It just laughs. If the tree could speak it would say: "I was here long before you, and I'll be here when you're gone." It's true, I sold the house in 2003. The house has been torn down, but the live oak trees are still there. That's the web. It's deep and broad. Try to change it, you might as well try to boil the ocean.
