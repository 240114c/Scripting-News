In 1995 I wrote a piece entitled <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#3">The Baseball God</a>. It was about two days. 1. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_World_Series#Game_5">day</a> the Mets won the World Series in 1969. 2. And the day of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake">Loma Prieta quake</a>, when the Giants were playing the A's in the World Series in San Francisco. I only realize now, 24 years later, that they were just one day apart, October 17 in 1989, and October 16 in 1969 (I'm writing this on October 17, 2019). Is the Baseball God sending us a message?
