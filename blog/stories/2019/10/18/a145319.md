# Using git for code distribution
I'm working on a project using <a href="https://github.com/steveukx/git-js#readme">simple-git</a> in Node, and have what I think should be a simple application, but I can't figure out how to do it. Rather than spend another whole day fumbling around, I thought I'd write it up here and ask for help. ;-)
* I have a folder on my local hard drive containing the source for an application. Various JavaScript files, a package.json, folders for user data and stats. 
* A location on GitHub, specified by the URL of the repo and a path to a folder in the repo. This allows the code for many apps to be deployed from a single repo. I have a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/test2">repo</a> called test2 with a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/test2/tree/master/helloworld">folder</a> whose path is helloworld/
* The goal is to make sure the local folder has the most recent copy of the contents of the folder on GitHub.

I have code that clones the repo, but that gets a copy of everything in the repo. I just need to keep up to date with one folder. 

Any help much appreciated.
