# Using git for code distribution
I'm working on a project using <a href="https://github.com/steveukx/git-js#readme">simple-git</a> in Node, and have what I think should be a simple application, not sure how to do it. 
* I have a local called myAppFolder containing the source for an application. Various JavaScript files, a package.json, folders for user data and stats. 
* A location on GitHub, a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/test2">repo</a> called test2 with a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/test2/tree/master/helloworld">folder</a> whose path is helloworld/ that is meant to have the most up to date version of the files from the location on GitHub. 
* It's a one-way sync, from the server to the local folder. 

I have <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/397be0cf030bc3709eb73f3deb6f5912">code</a> that clones the repo, but that gets a copy of everything in the repo. 

I just need to keep up to date with one folder. 

Any help much appreciated.

PS: I opened this as an <a href="https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/issues/403">issue</a> on the simple-get repo.
