# Breaking Bad finale
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/19/mrWhite.png" border="0" align="right">As with previous installments, this contains spoilers. 

I watched the last two episodes of Breaking Bad. 

I think I had only watched them once, when they first came out, but I remembered almost all of it. And it's amazing that so much happens in the last episode.

First I want to say that my <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/18/171521.html">previous report</a> is one of the sloppiest bits of writing and editing I've ever done. It's practically incoherent. Sorry.

The point was this, even though I hate Walter White, his humanity comes through, and his broken heart. Even more so in the finale. No one wants his money. His son wants him to die. He even admits now he wasn't doing it for his family, he was doing it because he's good at making meth and being a crime boss, and he likes it. 

In the end he forgives Jesse. And he spends his last moments in Jesse's meth lab, and he's happy in the only way Walter White ever was happy. 

Was it a great show? Yes. No reservations.

I got started on this exploration by watching the Breaking Bad movie that just came out. I was wondering if there was anything they could have done with two hours that would be respectful of the show. I haven't figured that out. I'll let you know if I do.
