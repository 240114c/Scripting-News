# How to protest
A permanent citizen's occupation of DC. 

We don't leave until Trump does.

You sign up for one full day of your choosing. 

There's room for say 100K people. 

Once 100K people have committed for a given day, that's it, the day is full. You have to sign up for another day. 

You arrange to get yourself to DC and back home. 

Carry a sign or wear a button or clothing that says you're there to demand Trump's impeachment and removal. 

Go anywhere in the space between the Capital and the White House.

Rain or shine.
