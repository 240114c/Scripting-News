I think a blog should be like an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Caen">Herb Caen</a> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/herbcaen/">column</a> in the SF Chronicle. A goings-on-around-town type flow of mostly gossip. Short items not essays. Caen's first columns were literally <a href="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/22/45/75/4874108/3/920x920.jpg">columns</a>.  I wonder if there are online columnists who use this style. Send pointers if you know of any (I assume there are many).
