The Dropbox situation has become more dire. I pretty much have to stop everything and reconceive how I work with my servers from my desktop. Something broke. I may have a workaround. The lesson here is that when you depend on other people's tech, at some point it will fail, and they what will you do. It's hard to have a plan for this kind of outage.
