<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/14/mlk.png" border="0" align="right">We need a Wikipedia for news. A landing page for each story, with a summary, and pointer to coverage of all major news sites. As they all adopt paywalls I find it's hard to pick a good story to point to from pieces on my blog. Also I don't like pointing to news pages that are overloaded with crapware. Two bits of prior art. <a href="https://politicalwire.com/">Political Wire</a> and <a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/">Memeorandum</a>. I like Political Wire's synopses, and Memeorandum's accumulation of links and tweets. Merge those two ideas, and cover more than politics, that's the basic idea. And also use relatively future-safe server tech.
