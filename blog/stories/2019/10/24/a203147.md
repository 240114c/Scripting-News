I feel sorry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Engel">Richard Engel</a> on MSNBC. His <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/11th-hour/watch/trump-withdrawal-of-u-s-troops-makes-putin-the-kingmaker-in-syria-71871557542">reporting from Syria</a> raises a question that his colleagues in the US don't want to discuss. Russia moving in to take over from the US is no accident, it was the plan. In America for some reason they don't want to incorporate the obvious fact that Trump is working for Russia, not for the United States. Over and over, for years, they pretend they don't know this. Why?
