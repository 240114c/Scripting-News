Over the decades I've spun out a lot of individual developers from teams I lead. That started when I sold Living Videotext to Symantec in 1987. I left the company a few months after the deal closed. I wasn't smart or patient enough to try to fit into someone else's company, and I had a <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">project</a> I really wanted to do. Here's the interesting thing. When I called back the developers I had left behind, and asked if they would collaborate on interop with my new product, they told me how they work for a big company now and can't collaborate with someone like me. Heh. I knew that they were working on a project with Apple called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock_(framework)">Bedrock</a>. Anyway, it happens all the time. Once they or I leave the nest, they don't see the value of continuing the collaboration. You'd think, schooled in the power of prior art and interop, they'd want to go forth in the world and create more interop, but big companies are a big influence on the people who work there. Even relatively small companies (like Symantec in the 80s) have a lot of inward pull.
