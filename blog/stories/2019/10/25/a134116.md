I have a <a href="https://www.waterfurnace.com/literature/premier/sp1555.pdf">geothermal</a> heating and cooling <a href="https://www.waterfurnace.com/">system</a> that works well, is supposed to be efficient (I haven't used it enough to verify) but there is one thing that sucks about it. When it turns on there's a huge slamming sound. Like a garage door. You can't sleep through it. It's jarring even when you're awake. I get mixed opinions. Some say the loud sound is just the way it works, and others say it's wrong, they have used geothermal systems that worked just like any other forced air heating or cooling system. Anyway I have the problem solved for now, at least in October. I don't turn the heat on. I use a space heater at night, and keep the bedroom door closed. But we haven't had a frost yet. Then I'll <a href="https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/winter-storm/frozen-pipes.html">need</a> another answer.
