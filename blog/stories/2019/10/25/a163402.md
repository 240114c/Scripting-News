# On this day in 1986
I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ujwjqIldwU">Game 6</a> of the 1986 World Series at my brother's apartment in Palo Alto, with our father.

At the moment the ball went through Buckner's legs, I remember vividly my father rolling around on the floor.

It was the one time in a lifetime I saw my father let go.

It was wonderful.
