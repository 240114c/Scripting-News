I hear some Democrats are getting crazy about the choices we have for president. They're trying to think of someone to come in and save the day. They come up with the usuals, Bloomberg, Kerry, even HRC again. But what about Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state? Really smart, thinks well on his feet, confident, has executive experience. Republicans would like him. I don't know about blacks, but he's so much more confidence-inspiring than Biden imho.
