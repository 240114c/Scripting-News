<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/24/trumpHead.png" border="0" align="right">The new half-season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman#Season_6_(Part_One)">BoJack Horseman</a> was of course very good. I gulped it down in two sittings. Can't wait for the final episodes on Jan 31.
