# Lock Him Up is very American
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/26/colin.png" border="0" align="right">Last night, the crowd at the World Series game in DC did something most of us would love to do if given the chance. With President Trump in attendance, being called out on the scoreboard, they first boo'd him and then <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=world+series+game+5+lock+him+up+2019&t=h_&ia=news&iar=news">chanted</a> Lock Him Up. 

As a Mets fan of course I don't usually have a lot of sympathy for Nationals fans, but this is bigger than baseball. I love what they did.  

<i>Lock Him Up</i> should be the chant at every sports event until he is locked up.

This morning on MSNBC we get a <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-lock-him-up-chants-are-un-american-72161349993">lecture</a> from Morning Joe and Mika saying you shouldn't do that. And then Senator Chris Coons from Delaware, a Democrat, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/467698-democratic-senator-criticizes-crowd-booing-trump-the-office-of-the-president">says</a> the same. Respect the office if you don't respect the person. Well fuck you. We've been very civil through this whole process, and we're fed up. If you respect the office so much, Coons, why do you stand by and let him shit all over it?

These people have the wrong idea about who we are. We're not children who are misbehaving. We're the electorate of this country, the ones who elected them, and we're saying if you haven't had enough yet, we have. It's time to do what we sent you there to do.  

So much damage is being done to our country while pundits and Democrats worry about which side of the plate the napkin goes. When you get him out of <i>our White House, </i>we'll stop calling for him to be locked up. Do your jobs and until you take care of this just shut up. 

BTW, the reaction from pols and pundits reinforces that it would be a good idea to have a <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/21/140215.html">permanent citizen's occupation</a> of DC. 100K people, always there, walking up and down the mall chanting <i>Lock Him Up</i> until the Repubs and Dems and members of the Supreme Court get the idea that the people of the United States are fed up not just with him, but with you too. 

PS: Now that the pundits and pols are making such a big deal about this, it'll be interesting to see what happens Tuesday night in Houston.
