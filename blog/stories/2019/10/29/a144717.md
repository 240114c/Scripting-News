I was hoping podcasting would be more spontaneous and casual, sort of like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O52jAYa4Pm8">Talking Heads song</a> that goes like this: "When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed. Say something once, why say it again?" Of course I don't live up to that rule on my own blog. :boom:
