I had breakfast last week with a new local <a href="https://twitter.com/markzip">friend</a> who reads this blog. He's a former DJ at <a href="http://www.radiowoodstock.com/">WDST</a>, and from that he <a href="http://www.zipsziggurat.com/">built</a> a business selling music at <a href="http://nyrecordfairs.com/">fairs</a> in the northeast. He was in the business when Napster rolled through. We shared some interesting stories. I told him what I had been hearing about <a href="https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/local-news/woodstock-site-of-wdst-and-bearsville-theater-sold-to-company/article_24d75aa4-ce5f-11e9-bdd4-db5cb1e71857.html">the</a> <a href="https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2019/09/06/bearsville-complex-has-a-new-owner/">sale</a> and <a href="https://bearsvillecenter.com/">reboot</a> of <a href="https://www.rhino.com/article/new-this-week-todd-rundgren-the-complete-bearsville-albums-collection">Bearsville</a> and Todd Rundgren's old studio and stage. British dude, his sports are rugby and soccer. Not much overlap with this NBA and MLB guy.
