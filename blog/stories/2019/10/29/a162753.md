I've been working on an SQL-based RSS <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+river6&t=h_&ia=web">aggregator</a> for a while. I just got it working with a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/">managed database</a> on Digital Ocean. That's a big deal because I don't want to manage databases. Now I don't have to? So far I like it though there were too many hoops to jump through for the setup. A Hello World app for Node with step by step instructions would have helped. Good docs is the thing that sets Digital Ocean apart from AWS. This time I have to say they could be better.
