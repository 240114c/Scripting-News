The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/kyrie-irvings-volatility-makes-nets-officials-queasy/">reality of Kyrie</a> is sinking in for the Nets. I didn't used to care about the Nets, and I still don't, but I wonder why Kyrie thought we would? Their story is only interesting because of the drama. I would have preferred if they grew slowly. New York is a dysfunctional NBA city, btw, in case it wasn't obvious.
