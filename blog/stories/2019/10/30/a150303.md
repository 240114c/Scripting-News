I agree with what he said, but you can do it, by keeping a backlog of unreleased debugged features. If you use the feature yourself every day and it works well, you can probably estimate when it will ship to users, because you could do it tomorrow if you wanted (or at least start testing it). This is a weird idea in the old way of doing software, because people always release what they have as soon as they have. A number of years ago I stopped doing that. I have a backlog of debugged usable stuff that only I have used. So if I announced a feature from the backlog I could definitely predict when it would be available.
