He says "there's almost no space for writing anymore that's joyful or an attempt to be creative. hardly anyone is playing around with form or even just trying to entertain. so much of the joy has been sucked out of the internet unless its crowdsourced by platforms from ppl who aren't paid." I have a ton of fun writing this blog, and because I'm a programmer and have the time I'm always adding new features here. Stuff you can't find anywhere else. Charlie, you see what you want to see. I'm sure you have reasons why you'll never read my blog. That's why you don't see the brilliance on the web, it's there, you just wear glasses that filter out the good stuff. Seriously. This is such an important life lesson.
