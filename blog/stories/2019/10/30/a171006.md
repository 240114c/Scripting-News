Something I consistently forget, <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/30/dateComparisonJavaScript.png">date comparison</a> in JavaScript doesn't work. Date objects are alway unequal, even if they represent the same actual date. Convert the objects to numbers and compare those instead: d1.getTime () == d2.getTime ().
