Something I consistently forget, <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/30/dateComparisonJavaScript.png">date comparison</a> in JavaScript doesn't work. Dates are alway unequal, even if they represent the same actual date. Convert the Date objects to numbers you compare those instead like this: d1.getTime () == d2.getTime (). That works as you would expect.
