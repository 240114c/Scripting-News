# Positioning Tulsi
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/03/20/trump.png" border="0" align="right">Okay Tulsi is going to do a third party run.

No one knows who or what she is. 

So before she has a chance to position herself, do it for her. That's straight out of the Repub playbook and it's smart.

Make it so she takes votes away from Trump not the Demo.

Something like this.

<i>If you like Trump, vote for Trump. Don't waste your vote on Tulsi. </i>

That would do it. 

Blast that message everywhere. 

$1 million spent today is worth $100 million after she finishes positioning herself.

PS: If you haven't read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)">positioning</a> you should. It's logical and fun, and explains a lot about how products work in the human mind. It's Marketing 101.
