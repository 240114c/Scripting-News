The intro of this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/how-i-podcast-im-listenings-anita-flores/">TechCrunch piece</a> got me to do a <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/31/theBeautyOfPodcasting.m4a">podcast</a> myself. "The beauty of podcasting is that anyone can do it. It’s a rare medium that’s nearly as easy to make as it is to consume." Thank you. That was by design.
