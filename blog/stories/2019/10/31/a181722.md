# Trump vs the Constitution
I wish journalism would consider that it's not Dems v Trump rather it's Trump v Constitution.

The Constitution needs protecting. The Repubs are for some reason willing to let the Democrats carry the ball alone. 

But when it gets to the Senate they won't have that luxury.
