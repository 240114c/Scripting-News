We're erecting a Maginot Line, getting ready to re-fight the Battle of 2016, ignoring that the enemy already controls our capital. We should be <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/02/134152.html">innovating</a>, but we're not. We're defending against Nixon with lots of Woodsteins. I have a weird feeling we should let Zuck and Jack do what they want, and <i>help</i> them, because our current response is a loser, totally inadequate.
