You mean <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/04/democrats-tiptoe-pocahontas-hunter-trump-063942">journalism</a> is licking their chops. “Hillary’s Emails” was fake news created by the NY Times. We haven’t forgotten. This is the corruption of American journalism. We never got an apology from the NYT or even a mea culpa. It isn’t the first time NYT fuckery cost us huge. These people are drunk with power, and are accountable to no one.
