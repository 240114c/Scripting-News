I think Sherrod Brown or Amy Klobuchar would be good Democratic candidates for president. I listened to today's Daily podcast about the chances of the Demo candidates based on polling the NYT just did. It's not a good picture. They say Biden would win, but the Repubs haven't run a campaign on him yet. They're going to wait until after the Dems tear him to shreds, which they will. People think this is about policy, it's not. They want to feel like winners. I wouldn't feel like a winner, of any kind, if my president was Warren, Sanders or Biden. Ugh. Anyway if a Democrat is elected what they'll do will depend totally on the makeup of Congress. The more Repubs that are left the more compromise, unless of course Trump is re-elected, then you can forget about who's in Congress, it doesn't matter. Even if the Dems won a 60-vote majority in the Senate and held control in the House. Our Congress will be no more consequential than Russia's. THey have one for show, but that's all it is. I agree with Chait that the Dems have been living in a fantasy land. None of the leading candidates will beat Trump, none of them.
