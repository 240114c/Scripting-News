I have a bit of time to kill today, and I thought I'd try to get to the bottom of some weird behavior in the JS code for this blog. This item has an attached image that is revealed when you click the wedge next to the item. But when it's revealed it happens very slowly, and it opens from the top and left, with a scrolling effect that I now find annoying. I must have made it do this originally, but I don't remember how, and I can't seem to find the code. I'm going to keep looking. :boom:
