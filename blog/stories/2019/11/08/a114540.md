I didn’t realize people take the lack of a warning from Google or Firefox as an endorsement. If they do they’re going to be sorry because bad guys can get secure websites too. This is where the <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">push</a> to https blows up. The next step, obviously, is to make websites register with Google, and have their changes approved the same way iPhone devs do. Quickly this will mean no criticism of China, and of course Google.
