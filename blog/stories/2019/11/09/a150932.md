Did a little prototyping for the <i>tweetsucker</i> project I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/07.html#a144614">about</a> the other day, and noted that the Twitter API <a href="https://github.com/reneraab/node-twitter-api">toolkit</a> that I use is now marked as not maintained. It still works, but It seems this is something Twitter ought to maintain, or pay someone to maintain. Letting this fall out of sync with the actual API wouldn't be very good.
