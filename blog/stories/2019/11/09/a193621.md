As a newbie in town, I have basic questions like where to shop for groceries, ride the bike, look at the stars, which airport to fly out of -- really basic stuff.  I usually post the question in the private Facebook group for the town. I keep an outline of some, not all of the questions and the best advice, <a href="http://this.how/woodstock/newbies.opml">on this.how</a>. It's for things that aren't blog posts, stories I want to come back to, edit, refine, add to.
