Right now I'm going through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot">Mr Robot</a> a second time, slowly. It's worth doing, because now the things Elliot says to the audience make sense. After the big reveal on Mr Robot, he looks at the camera and asks "Did you know?" I laughed and said damn right I knew. It's interesting in a different way when you know what's real and what's not.
