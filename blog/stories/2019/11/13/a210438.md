I requested my <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-save-and-migrate-your-yahoo-groups-data-before-i-1839172243">Yahoo Groups backup</a> a few weeks ago, and got the download today. Not sure how useful this is. Lots of zipped files in various formats. I'm going to try to hold onto my download as long as I can.
