<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/donald-trump-syria-oil-us-troops-isis-turkey">Trump</a>, with Erdogan next to him, on Syria: "We are keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil." When I saw this I couldn't believe he actually said this out loud, on the record. Someone in the military must have told him, many times, how statements like this put at risk all US military everywhere. I don't buy that Trump is an idiot who has no idea what he's doing. Also it's a joke that we would be trying to acquire or steal more carbon-based energy. We should be putting carbon from the atmosphere back in the ground, not taking it out.
