Jimmy Wales <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9956ff9c-0622-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">wants</a> to turn <a href="https://wt.social/">WikiTribune</a> into a Facebook or Twitter competitor. That imho is a much better idea than hiring reporters, as he did in the first instance of WT. The question is this -- can Jimmy Wales draw a positive community that will work cooperatively on the mission he has defined, defunking news. I signed on but I'm number <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/14/waitingList.png">26673</a> on the waiting list.
