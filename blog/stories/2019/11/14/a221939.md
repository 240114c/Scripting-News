<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/14/babyHuey.png" border="0" align="right">Can you imagine what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr">AG Barr</a> must think. It was his skill at hype that dug Trump out of the jam he was in with Mueller. What a gift. That was just Act One. Next would be the indictments for Justice people who started the Mueller investigation, to set an example for the people who remain. Either be loyal to Trump or get out. He probably figured he'd have DoJ and the spy agencies cleaned out by the end of the year. Then, after winning re-election, something Barr couldn't help with, they would be ready for Act Three, replete with goose-stepping storm troopers and gas chambers for people of color and non-Christians. Trump, who's like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Huey">Baby Huey</a>, couldn't keep his hands clean long enough for Act Two to even start. I'm guessing the <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2019/11/14/trump-seen-in-animated-conversation-with-william-barr/">animated conversation</a> was over Barr resigning. The Trump Train isn't going where he thought it was, and if Barr stays on board, he's probably going to jail. His bet was a long shot, and now it's impossibly long. Trump may survive impeachment, but he's not likely to become the American Hitler.
