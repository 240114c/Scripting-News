# Russia, Russia Ã¼ber alles
All of it.If you watched <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show">Maddow</a> last night, it would be hard to call the first day of testimony a snoozefest. 

Here's the deal. Everything the president does not only benefits him personally, at the expense of the USA, but it also all benefits Russia. All of it.

So more than an impeachment, we are hearing a case study about how the Republican Party and the American president are servants of a foreign adversary. A truth most of us find hard to accept, I guess. 

We need more than impeach and remove.

We need an exorcism.
