Here's the deal. Everything the president does not only benefits him personally, at the expense of the USA, but it also all benefits Russia. All of it.

So more than an impeachment, we are hearing a case study about how the Republican Party and the American president are servants of a foreign adversary. A truth most of us find hard to accept, I guess. But there's a lot more of this than has come to light. This is just the first that has been so microscopically exposed. Expect that when we peer into the Turkish invasion of Kurdistan, we will find another clusterfuck of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">your favorite country</a> and mine. 

We need more than impeach and remove.

We need an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism">exorcism</a>.
