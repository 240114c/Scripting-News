Very confused about Jimmy Wales' supposed Facebook/Twitter competitor, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=WT%3ASocial&t=h_&iar=news&ia=news">WT:Social</a>. What is the monthly fee? And what is it behind the paywall? Tech journalism is basically nonexistent these days. It does not in any way appear to be a competitor of Facebook and Twitter.
