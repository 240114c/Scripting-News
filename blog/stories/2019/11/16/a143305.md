I'm working my way through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot">Mr Robot</a>, starting with season 1 so I can watch the final season without being horribly confused. But all of a sudden there's the final season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)">Man in the High Castle</a>. Oy. And the third season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)">The Crown</a> is coming soon.
