Following up on yesterday's <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/16/153957.html">american.newbie</a> piece. True story. I went to eat Chinese food with my Mom a few years ago. Highly rated <a href="https://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/flushingstore_eng.html">restaurant</a>. In the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/136-21+37th+Avenue,+Flushing,+NY+11354/@40.7619076,-73.8325639,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2600fe1184edf:0xc9f4b28c9f22d92a!8m2!3d40.7619076!4d-73.8303752">neighborhood</a> I grew up, many years ago when it was a sleepy boring place with an embarassing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens">name</a>. Most of the people spoke Chinese. We had to wait quite a while for a table. When we were seated the waiter asked if we were tourists. I laughed and said no we're natives. The funny thing is that not that long ago we were the newbies. The food was fantastic, btw. So many flavors, very satisfying. Before the Chinese came, Flushing was famous for nothing in the way of anything, in the last three centuries at least. :boom:
