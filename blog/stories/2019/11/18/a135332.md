I was wondering why we never hear anything about the CEO of Fox News, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Scott">Suzanne Scott</a>. One of the most influential people in the American political system, and very few people know anything <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22suzanne+scott%22+fox+news&t=hx&ia=web">about her</a>.
