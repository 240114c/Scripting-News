# Marshall Plan for Repubs
We need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan">Marshall Plan</a> for Republicans. 

This is a moment of opportunity that will not come again. 

This is why, if you campaign against Bloomberg because whatever, you're being selfish. Let him run. 

The only thing that matters in this election is this:

Does the candidate respect the Constitution?

If so, good.

You don't have to vote for them, but don't denigrate them. In the big picture you all are on the same side. 

Fucking <b>wake up</b> and realize where WE ALL are.
