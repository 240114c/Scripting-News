Itâ€™s a good thing Google <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">discontinued</a> their RSS reader product. Had it continued, they would likely be torturing "RSS" the same way they are <a href="https://developers.google.com/amp">HTML</a> and <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">HTTP</a>. Had they kept it they could have siloed podcasting, for example.
