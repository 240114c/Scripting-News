A lesson I've learned from recent successes in blogging. You must always think of your blog as if you were starting it now, not in the past. The world is different. There was no Twitter in 1994. Twitter wasn't usable until last year with the switch to 280 chars. Facebook was used for serious discourse (somewhat) until a couple of years ago. Email is resurging as a publishing medium. People are still thirsty for stories that relate to their lives. But getting into their minds with all the competition requires constant creativity. Not showmanship, cleverness. Creativity.
