American journalism is never far from falling back to the horse race in everything. Who the hell knows or cares how many senators will ultimately vote to remove, it's impossible to know, or to even know if the vote will ever happen. Waste of time to speculate. And it isn't even up to the senators, it's the voters. The senators will vote to remove if it means they feel they will lose their election.
