People should just use their names in the space where you put your name in a tweet. After a couple of years of playing with it, I find it's just confusing to put messages there. An example.  <a href="https://twitter.com/dweinberger">David Weinberger</a> is someone I would read every <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/22/tweetexample.png">tweet</a> of, but sometimes miss because he's endlessly creative with his twitter name. I believe this is called <a href="https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/cognitive-overload">cognitive overload</a>. My brain just screams "too much" and I move on to the next tweet.
