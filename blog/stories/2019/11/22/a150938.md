<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/12/23/santa.png" border="0" align="right">A long time ago I was having lunch with someone I thought was a friend. He told a story about how he tried to buy "Radio UserLand, a product I developed, from the company that owned it. I guess at the time he didn't know that I still owned a majority share of the company. The people who were running it never brought the idea to me. I asked why he didn't just try to work with me. I would have totally been open to the idea. He explained he wanted to own it. I've seen this happen over and over. People who build careers with products that are copies of stuff I had already done. I keep wondering why we couldn't work together. They do it in other creative fields. I just got caught up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot">Mr Robot</a>. I picked the right moment to do it. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=rm+robot+season+4+episode+7&t=h_&ia=web">S04 E07</a> was a total masterpeice and a big reveal. Look at all the talent that had to come together to make that happen. <a href="https://tracks.ranea.org/post/35606102112/mistitled-andrew-singer-rip">Andrew Singer</a> a former colleague said once that in tech we don't stand on the shoulders of giants, we stand on their toes. It's so sad. I know at some point we will work out collaboration. We have to.
