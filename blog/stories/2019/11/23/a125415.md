# UPS no longer delivers
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/23/ups.png" border="0" align="right">Living in the country, as I do, I order a lot of stuff on Amazon. The nearest department store is about 40 minutes away and it's a Walmart, not exactly my favorite place to shop. 

In the last week the UPS driver on my route decided not to deliver to my house. The reason keeps changing, but it seems there's nothing I can do about it, so I gave up. I asked the UPS people to return the packages to Amazon. I expect Amazon will refund the purchase price. They're usually pretty good with that. 

There are no Amazon lockers nearby. But UPS has a relationship with the hardware store in town (8 minutes from my house). That's going to be my next approach. To see if there's a way for UPS to deliver my packages to the store. 

And while the UPS people I've talked with have been professional overall this leaves a really bad feeling here for UPS. One day they deliver to your house and the next day they don't. Whatever the reason (it keeps changing) it's not cool.
