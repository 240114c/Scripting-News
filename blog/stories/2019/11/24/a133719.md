<img src="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2007/11/21/turkey.gif" border="0" align="right">It's the best time of year for binge-watching. I'm up to date on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot">Mr Robot</a>. As far as I'm concerned they could stop right here. But there are still six more episodes in the series. Now I'm working my way through the third season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)">The Crown</a>. Another tour de force. Waiting in the wings is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)">Man in the High Castle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)">The Morning Show</a>, which is fantastic even though it got awful reviews. I only watched the first three episodes, the ones that were released when AppleTV+ came out. I want to wait until the season is done so I can watch it all in a series. I'm not a big fan of waiting a week between episodes. I'm a fairly modal person in most things I do and TV is certainly one of them. I also know a few people who are just now catching up on Succession. Can't wait to hear what they think. No spoilers. :boom:
