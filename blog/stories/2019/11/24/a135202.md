BTW -- the reason <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show">The Morning Show</a> got bad reviews is that it isn't what a newsroom really is like. Because presumably the reviewers know what newsrooms are like. The rest of us don't. We loved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing">The West Wing</a> even though it was nothing like working in the White House. Dramas depend not on the reality of what they portray, rather the ability of the writers, actors and technical people to tell a story that pulls you in, gets you to care, makes you forget you aren't in their world instead of your own. They become your friends, and you develop an intimacy you can't get with your real friends and family. That's why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)">The Morning Show</a> is so good. The writing, acting, and everything else are done by people who know how to get you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">where</a> you want to go. Whether it resembles the way newsrooms work, the only people who care about that are reviewers.
