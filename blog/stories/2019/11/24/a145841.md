I'm moving apps from an old server where Dropbox stopped working to another old sterver where Dropbox still works. It's like taking apart a robot and putting it back together. Lots of wires to hook up. And just getting the old pieces off the old server without Dropbox was a pain the ass. Lots of chances for mistakes. I really need to make this kind of thing easy. I know just use containers. I do actually. It's at the next level up where I could use more factoring and abstraction.
