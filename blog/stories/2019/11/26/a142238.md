# Morning coffee notes
Good morning coffee fans!

This is something I used to do in the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22morning+coffee+notes%22&t=h_&ia=web">early days</a> of the blog. When I started work in the morning, I'd create a section for the first notes of the day. It's nice because it leaves room at the top of the page as the day goes on, and I don't have to shuffle the morning stuff off to new places.

Morning Coffee Notes was also the name of <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">my first podcast</a>, in the summer of 2004.

Want to see and hear my first podcast? Scroll down to <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/26/mcnFirst.png">6/11/2004</a>. 

Later that year I started another podcast with Adam Curry called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22trade+secrets%22&t=h_&ia=web">Trade Secrets</a>. It was a cool name for a podcast, It would be cool even today with the glut of podcasts because it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre">double entendre</a>, and inviting if you're into secrets that are traded. 

Now I forgot why I started today's MCN section. 

I'll catch up on my next coding break. :boom:
