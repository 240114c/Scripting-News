Every story ends with the same puzzle. Why does Trump love Russia? We don't know. We just don't know. It's like the line in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Harry_Met_Sally...">Harry Met Sally</a> where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55VPeDVxsrg">Carrie Fisher</a> says "He'll never leave her, I know, I know he'll never leave her." Everyone says it at some point. We can recite it along with them. "No one thinks he'll ever leave her," says Meg Ryan. At some point you hope she gets the clue.
