Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1199777312054493184">clarifies</a> its inactive account policy. My concern was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">linkrot</a>. Twitter accounts are websites, and we point to them and include them, as I point to the new Twitter policy above. Jack was around when the web was very young. The idea is that we're creating a record. It's not ephemeral. It should survive us. It shouldn't matter if a site is active. Now we know that users care about preserving the web. Twitter is part of that.
