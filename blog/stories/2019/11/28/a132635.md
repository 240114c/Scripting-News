# The Irishman, with spoilers
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/11/28/theIrishman.png" border="0" align="right">My mini Irishman review.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese">Scorsese</a> has a style, you can see it in the first scene of <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/27.html#a195050">The Irishman</a>, and you smile, not knowing what's coming next, but knowing it's going to be good. The camera snakes through a nursing home and finds our narrator, an ancient Robert De Niro, and the story begins.

They do some fancy CGI stuff to show the characters much younger than the actors are today, but it doesn't work. I was thinking about that all through the movie. How old they are now, the staples of a Scorsese gangland movie, De Niro (76), Pesci (76) and one who's not a staple but also ancient, Pacino (79). And how old are they supposed to be in the scene I'm watching now. It was never clear. 

It could have been more emotional, gripping and surprising, as good as any of his films, if he had used new actors. The CGI tricks stole the show and not in a good way, imho.

Now that said you <i>must</i> watch it. Even a not-so-great Scorsese movie is epic and historic, especially with this cast, at this point in all their careers.
