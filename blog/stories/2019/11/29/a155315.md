Sometime soon I want to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> running on one of my <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> servers. Their <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-16-04">docs</a> tend to be pretty good, and I desperately want to be able to manage servers using a Mac and a Finder-like interface.
