Sometime soon I want to get a GUI running on one of my Digital Ocean servers. Their <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-16-04">docs</a> tend to be pretty good, and I desperately want to be able to manage my server using a Mac and a Finder-like interface.
