My favorite binges are multi-season dramas with great writing and acting, and a vision from the show runner. Few series are so great that they check all the boxes, but some do. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire">The Wire</a> was the best of all time. Mad Men had a very strong vision, but the quality of story-telling was spotty, as was Breaking Bad. Deadwood, what a great show, but it ended before it got to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota#19th_century">punchline</a>. I like intense political drama and crime stories that get you into the characters. So I'm considering re-watching a few <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls049563664/">HBO miniseries</a> that got to me the first time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Kitteridge_(miniseries)">Olive Kitteridge</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Of">The Night Of</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(miniseries)">Mildred Pierce</a>.
