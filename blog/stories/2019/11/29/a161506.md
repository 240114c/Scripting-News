Also if you haven't seen the several seasons of Fargo, as a TV series, go for it. It's not a replay of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(film)">movie</a>, which of course is wonderful, rather it is a series of stories told in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fargo,+ND/@46.854112,-101.3112844,6z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x52c8cb8d84677145:0x81aa30a52791aaca!8m2!3d46.8771863!4d-96.7898034">FargoLand</a>, with some overlap in plot and characters.
