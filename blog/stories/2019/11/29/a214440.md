# White Russian
I am what you might think of as a white Russian. My grandparents on my father's side came from the eastern side of the Urals. But I was born in the US of A. Maybe that's why the favored drink for the night after Thanksgiving is a White Russian, which also happens to be the favorite drink of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski">Jeff Lebowski</a>.

So, while turkey soup is simmering...

A very easy drink to make, and love. 
1. Ice cubes.
2. Kahlua.
3. Vodka.
4. Heavy cream.

Sip.

Yum.
