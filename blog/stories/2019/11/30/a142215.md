# Leftover turkey soup
On Twitter, Anthony DeRosa <a href="https://twitter.com/Anthony/status/1200597085135032320">requested</a> my turkey soup recipe. 
1. Boil the remains of turkey carcass. Add spices, basil, oregano, hot pepper, whatever you like. Let sit overnight.
2. Remove carcass, any bones, messy stuff. 
3. Chop leftover turkey bits, add to broth.
4. Brown onions, garlic, mushrooms, add.
5. Chop celery, carrots, leftover green beans.
6. Simmer while drinking <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/29/214440.html">White Russians</a> and watching HBO and Netflix.
7. After a few hours cook some rotini pasta, add to soup. Simmer for about an hour.
8. Eat. Enjoy. :boom:

But it's an improvisation. If you're inspired to add something weird, go ahead. It's still going to be turkey soup no matter what you do to it.
