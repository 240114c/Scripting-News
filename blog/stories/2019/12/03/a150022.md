<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/03/skier.png" border="0" align="right">We had a good size winter storm at my country house in the last couple of days. It's the kind of storm that's mostly wet in NYC, where I lived previously, but up here it was first heavy snow, then it got lighter. So the first time I shoveled the walkway to the car it was heavy lifting and the second time, light and easy. Perhaps 1.5 feet of snow. I drove down the road before it was plowed, having an AWD is great, and noted that someone had been cross country skiing on my road, I was envious. I took note of where the tracks came from, and went. The air is cold and clear, it feels like one of those mornings in Utah, it's the best first moment of a day anywhere. Later we'll be on top of the mountain looking down at the village, and thinking man this is as good as it gets. I have to figure out how to either ski or ride my bike in this weather. Probably both. I live about <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Woodstock,+New+York/Belleayre+Mountain+Ski+Center,+181+Galli+Curci+Rd,+Highmount,+NY+12441/@42.0837899,-74.4553503,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89dd0733c0cf4c2b:0xb85cbeef880771fc!2m2!1d-74.1181971!2d42.0409247!1m5!1m1!1s0x89dc5f4e10a1ac2d:0x611c1580c29f8a96!2m2!1d-74.505312!2d42.1322453!3e0">1/2 hour</a> from a ski area. It isn't Utah, or the Alps, but it is mine. :ski:
