<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/04/itsNotFascismWhenWeDoIt.png" border="0" align="right">Something always bothered me about <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>, and the direction <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> is going in, and of course <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>. Finally figured it out. I don't like tech companies imposing rules on writers. I may hate what pubs do with their tracking code and paywalls, but I hate what the tech industry is doing to oppose that, more. Maybe if Brave came out of the University of Illinios I would like it better, but it came from Silicon Valley, from the former CEO of Mozilla. A club of high <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22programming+priesthood%22&t=h_&ia=web">priests</a> of tech and their bankers who see us as the little people, when we're not ignored, to be treated with disdain and disrespect. They know what's best for us. It's like that old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHhrZgojY1Q">Who song</a>, meet the new boss same as the old boss. The web was about freedom. I hope if they control it as it appears they do something wonderful and free rises to replace them.
