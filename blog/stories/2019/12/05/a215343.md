# Speaker Pelosi kicks ass
“I think the President is a coward when it comes to helping our kids who are afraid of gun violence. I think he is cruel when he doesn’t deal with helping our dreamers of which we are very proud. I think he is in denial about the climate crisis.

However, that is about the election. Take it up in the election.

This is about Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the President’s violation of his oath of office.”
