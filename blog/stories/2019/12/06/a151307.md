<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/dorothy.png" border="0" align="right">Nancy Pelosi (not a boomer, she was born in 1940) was great yesterday, both in her press conference where she said what is sure to be a famous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/dec/05/dont-mess-with-me-nancy-pelosi-responds-to-reporter-asking-if-she-hates-trump-video">historic line</a>: "Don't mess with me" all the way to the CNN town hall, which I watched, where she asked not to have to look at things through the prism of the White House, which as long as Trump is there is crazy town. She's the leader we didn't know we had. What I admire most about her is her clarity and her ability to think on her feet. Either that or she really prepared for this moment. No matter, she's just what we need right now. A strong woman to stand up to Trump. That's his Kryptonite. He's like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowardly_Lion">Cowardly Lion</a> in the Wizard of Oz.
