I'm doing a reboot of the <a href="http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html">XML-RPC</a> website and readying a new JavaScript implementation. I was <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/06/frontierPointer.png">reminded</a> that the original reference implementation, in 1998, was in UserLand Frontier. The <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/reference/xml/xmlRpc/">docs</a> are still there. 21 years. Not bad.
