I can't stop watching <a href="https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds/status/1203118775815622664">this ad</a> for Aviation Gin. Three hot and emotive women, there's a plot, and a huge amount of character development. Something happened before this meetup of the three women over tall glasses of cold gin. And something will happen after. But this moment is very lovely, and that's why I find it so hard to move on.
