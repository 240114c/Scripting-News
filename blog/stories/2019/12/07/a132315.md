I can't stop watching <a href="https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds/status/1203118775815622664">this ad</a> for Aviation Gin. Three hot and emotive women, there's a plot, a huge amount of character development, non-verbal communication, lots to watch. Something happened before this meetup and something will happen after. But this moment is very lovely, and that's why I find it so hard to move on.
