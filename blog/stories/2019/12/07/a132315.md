Three hot and emotive women at a bar, facing the camera. There's a plot, a huge amount of character development, non-verbal communication, lots to watch. The music is kind of funny. Something happened before this meetup and something will happen after. But this moment is very lovely, and that's why I find it so hard to move on.
