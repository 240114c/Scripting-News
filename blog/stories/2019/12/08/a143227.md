One of the boxes I received the other day from Berkeley contains backups going back to Madison in 1979. All different kinds of media. I'm optimistic that I'll be able to find a CD drive that works with my Mac and (at least) reads the backups I took in the 90s. For the others I might have to visit the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a>, or possibly an equivalent setup in NYC or Boston.
