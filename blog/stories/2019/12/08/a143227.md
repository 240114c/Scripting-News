One of the boxes I received the other day from Berkeley contains backups I did going back to the living room of my apartment in Madison in 1979. All different kinds of media. I'm optimistic that I'll be able to find a CD drive that works with my Mac and reads the backups I took in the 90s. For the others I might have to visit the Computer History Museum, or possibly an equivalent setup in NYC or Boston.
