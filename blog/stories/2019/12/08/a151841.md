<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/08/globe.png" border="0" align="right">"He was caught trying to steal the 2020 election." That's what I want the Articles of Impeachment to say. That sends the message through the ages that at least the Democrats thought this was a problem. If the republic survives, of course that's the end of the Republican Party. I don't see how the stakes, for the world (Ukraine isn't part of the US) could be larger. BTW, I highly recommend listening to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/05/785134051/what-ukraines-president-thinks-of-trump-putin-the-impeachment-hearings">Fresh Air hour</a> about the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Very interesting story told by an American reporter who has had access. One thing came out in the Fresh Air story -- in Ukraine, the Trump impeachment of isn't big news. Due to their location at the front between the constitutional US govt and the Russian-dominated one, they couldn't be more a part of the US if they were Hawaii.
