In a web server would you expect files and folders whose names begin with a . to be served. Update: I hit a wall when I tried to create a folder with a . at the beginning of its name. I forgot that it means the file is invisible <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/09/macErrorMessage.png">in Mac OS</a>. That would make it pretty useless in "PagePark". The idea is to be able to put data, scripts, development notes for a site with the site itself. When you're managing and many domains as I am, economies like that prevent things from getting lost, or having version mismatches. But I want control over what people will see. Anyway I went with # as the special character. It's what we use in Frontier's website framework. Feels pretty good.
