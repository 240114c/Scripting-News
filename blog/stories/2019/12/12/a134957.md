<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/12/cowboy.png" border="0" align="right">I've had a chance to think more about Twitter's surprising <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">proposal</a> to come up with a web standard that turns Twitter into a protocol. I'm guessing the practical reason for this is so that Twitter can no longer be held responsible for abuse. They could ask Trump, for example, to host his own twitter, and people could subscribe to it anywhere, including Jack's twitter. It's basically a return to the open web after 13 years as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo">silo</a> that's been sucking the life out of the open web. I don't see why anyone but Twitter and its shareholders would go for this. I am still hoping Twitter, for the good of the web and the world, would expand to attach and display data from blogging software, as they attach and display video and images. That way writing beyond 280 chars with titles, links, simple styling can flourish. Same with podcasts. Twitter improves at a glacial pace, and they're hogging the fast lane of web media, of course along wtih the other silos.
