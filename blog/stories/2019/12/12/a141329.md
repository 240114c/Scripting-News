Note: If Twitter really wanted to help they could make it unnecessary to paste images of blog posts in tweets (<a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1205127001465597952">example</a>). Such an obvious thing. What could possibly stand in the way of doing this, when they do it for images and videos?
