Follow-up: Now that (I think) I understand Twitter's goal, what they really want is a way to have a feed be hooked into a Twitter "location." So one could follow, for example:  @whitehouse.gov:donaldtrump, and it would get updates from that server. <a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">RSS 2.0</a> would totally be able to do it.
