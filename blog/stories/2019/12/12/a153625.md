I wonder how many people know that Facebook turned off its most basic API. Got no press, no developer memory of it. It's as if all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_crossings_of_the_Hudson_River">Hudson crossings</a> to NYC were shut down permanently, only bigger because the population of Facebook is billions not millions of people. Twitter on the other hand shut down a portion of its APIs in 2012 and it put an indelible mark on the reputation of the company with developers. I personally forgave them because I anticipated it, I've been down this road many times, on both sides.
