# Other stuff
Lots of <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/12.html">stuff</a> relating to the question Twitter asked <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/11.html">yesterday</a>. To people who are new to my world, this is a big deal. We'll probably be talking about it for years, assuming we make it (not so sure after watching the House hearings). But other stuff is going on, I'll put those links here, thinking of the email going out tonight, which more and more is the pulse of my blogging. If you're not <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">subscribed</a> imho you're missing something. ;-)

One thing that pisses me of is when the Repubs talk about the Dems trying to redo the election they lost. I forgot about all the voter suppression, "her emails" and Comey's last minute surprise, and realized no, she won the election, you guys stole it. The gall of Trump to try to make a lie stick, that <i>he</i> was the victim of all that.
