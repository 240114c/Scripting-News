<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/01/bear.png" border="0" align="right">Lots of <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/12.html">stuff</a> relating to the question Twitter asked <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/11.html">yesterday</a>. To people who are new to my world, this is a big deal. We'll probably be talking about it for years, assuming we make it (not so sure after watching the House hearings). But other stuff is going on, I'll put those links here, thinking of the email going out tonight, which more and more is the pulse of my blogging. If you're not <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">subscribed</a> imho you're missing something. ;-)
