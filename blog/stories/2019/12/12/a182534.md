One thing that pisses me of is when the Repubs talk about the Dems trying to redo the election they lost. I forgot about all the voter suppression, "her emails" and Comey's last minute surprise, and realized no, she won the election, you guys stole it. The gall of Trump to try to make a lie stick, that <i>he</i> was the victim of all that.
