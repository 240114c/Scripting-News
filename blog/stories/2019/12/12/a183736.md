I've re-done the <a href="http://pagepark.io/">PagePark website</a>. Now it has all the docs from the GitHub repository. It gets the markdown text using GitHub's API, which is a new built-in feature in PagePark. I'm getting ready to do the work on the XML-RPC website, and this is the way I want to do it.
