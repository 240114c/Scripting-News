<a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1205560797105184770">Question</a>. I just booted up an old Wii on my modern 4K video setup. It looks very rough. I also have a Switch that I'm going to set up. I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports">Wii Sports</a>. I don't think they have anything like that for Switch. Plain simple bowling, golf, tennis, baseball, etc?
