<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/14/spaceShuttle.png" border="0" align="right"><a href="https://twitter.com/btaylor">Bret Taylor</a> is the new <a href="https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/1205262855861235713">COO</a> of Salesforce. This is notable because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor">Taylor</a> is a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1205509575862083591">real developer</a>. He led the development of Google Maps, then started FriendFeed, which <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+FriendFeed&t=h_&ia=web">we used</a>. It was acquired by Facebook where he became CTO and FriendFeed became the user interface of Facebook, the one we use today. He's created a lot of products, all excellent, timely and hugely popular. Having him lead a company like Salesforce is unusual, perhaps even unprecedented. A lot of tech CEOs have product backgrounds, but none as deep as Taylor. Salesforce also has <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&t=h_&ia=web">Heroku</a>, which is as far as I know unique and under-used. A simple way of hosting Node apps. I <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+heroku&t=h_&ia=web">used it</a> for a few years myself, until it became <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/05/12/whyIMovedOffHeroku.html">uneconomical</a>. If they were aggressive with it and invested, they could challenge Amazon and Google in hosting. Maybe they already do. Taylor has the depth and background to do some very consequential stuff at Salesforce. We'll be watching. :rocket:
