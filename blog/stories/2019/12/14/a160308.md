A big folder with lots of sub-folders, each of which is an app containing a package.json file, a node_modules folder, all app code, data. You figure out how to host them on servers, I don't care. It works like Dropbox, keeps the folders in sync with the running apps it's managing. I can write dashboards that run on my desktop that keep track of what's going on in the folders. You figure out how much resources I use and I pay for it.
