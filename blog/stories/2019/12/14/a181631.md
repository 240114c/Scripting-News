# Not enough right wing nut jobs in Nashville?
At a BloggerCon-like conference in Nashville. <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/05/07.html">2005</a>. My session was occupied by a small number of right wing Rush Limbaugh fans. All men, as you might imagine.

They were complaining no one was listening to them.

I was the moderator. I pointed out to the Nth guy to complain -- you know everyone is listening to you right now. Didn't matter, someone else started complaining about the same thing. They just kept saying the same words over and over, in a very angry tone. 

My response was basically I can't tell you why there aren't more right wing nut jobs here, best I can do is listen and empathize and then move on to the next complaint.
