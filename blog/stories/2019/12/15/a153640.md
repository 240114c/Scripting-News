Are you kidding? Amazon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/technology/amazon-aws-cloud-competition.html?emc=rss&partner=rss">appropriated</a> the small company's trademark -- Elastic? Please, NYT call at least one developer before you run a story like this, or do a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=amazon+elastic&t=h_&ia=web">search</a>. This is super embarrassing -- for you. Here's the problem with the premise. Amazon has been calling their services Elastic this and that since inception. The first was <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a>. Elastic Compute Cloud. It was <a href="http://scripting.com/2006/08/24.html#When:8:07:26AM">started in 2006</a>, six years before the startup was founded. It seems to me, unless I'm missing something, that the startup copied Amazon.
