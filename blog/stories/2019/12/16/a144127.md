I generally do not update iTunes, iPhones or iPads unless I've bought a new Apple product that requires I do so. I am never updating Mac OS because I'm running the last version that runs the OPML Editor, and I use it for mission-critical work. Also the only must-have feature Apple has introduced for Mac OS in the last 20 years is Time Machine. Everything else as far as I'm concerned is perfectly optional. Of course I will get inundated with email from people who couldn't live without X, Y or Z. I salute you in advance.
