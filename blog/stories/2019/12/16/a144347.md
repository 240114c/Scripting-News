That said I would <i>kill</i> for a Linux version of the OPML Editor. Then I could just use that OS, the same one I run on my servers and that would significantly simplify life. I'd even be willing to kick in money for that. We've never figured out a way to do that, but I just wanted to put that out there. Ted Howard is managing the <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/04/26/151833.html">releases</a> for the OPML Editor (it's a distro of UserLand Frontier). I am forever grateful for Ted for his work on this. It has made all my work much smoother.
