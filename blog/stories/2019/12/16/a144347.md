That said I would kill for a Linux version of the OPML Editor. Then I could just use that OS, the same one I run on my servers and that would significantly simplify life. I'd even be willing to kick in some money for that. We've never figured out a way to do that, but I just wanted to put that out there. Ted Howard is managing the releases for the OPML Editor (it's a distro of UserLand Frontier).
