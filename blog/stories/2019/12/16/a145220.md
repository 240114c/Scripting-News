I have a box of backup disks from my career going back to the early 80s. I would like to start backing them up if I can. I think I have a CD drive that can read the backups from the 90s, but the earlier disks which are in various size floppy disks and Iomega disks will be more problematic. Starting to <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1206589087253176323">think</a> about how I want to approach this. My goal is to get the content of the disks up to Amazon S3 or something like that.
