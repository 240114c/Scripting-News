# A boomer's memory
A commercial from the 60s or 70s that I only saw a few times that cracked me up.

Camera slowly enters a beautiful office with a distinguished older man behind the desk. The announcer says "And now a word from Guillermo Buitoni, president of Buitoni Foods." Camera continues in for a close up, and stops. Pauses a couple of seconds.

He says: If you want me to like you...

Another pause:

He says: Buy my pizza.

Logo. Cut.

It was perfect. No product shot. Just hey I'm this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Universe">Master of the Universe</a>, and of course you want me to like you. And I've made it realllly simple.

I wish I could find the video to see if it is as good as I remember it.
