Impeachment is not a horse race. It really doesn't matter who is president after the Constitution is gone. It can't be anyone but a Trump. They will rig the election so it always works out that way. As a preview in the last election <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Russian_presidential_election">Putin won</a> in a landslide. 77% of the vote. Putin's opposition was not allowed to run. Welcome to the United States, assuming Trump is not removed from office.
