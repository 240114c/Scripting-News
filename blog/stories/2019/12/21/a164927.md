# It's that time of year
<img src="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/plane.png" border="0" align="right">I used to, every year, name a Blogger of the Year. I wanted to keep the idea alive, that amateur writing has a place on the web. The last couple of years my focus has been elsewhere, even though in 2017, I took a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">fresh approach</a> to my own blog, with imho excellent results. 

I don't have a choice for this year. 

If you have a favorite blogger, perhaps a blog that goes with a favorite podcast, please add a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1208429729113612288">this thread</a>.

Here's to another great year in 2020, and remember it's even worse than it appears. :rocket: :boom:
