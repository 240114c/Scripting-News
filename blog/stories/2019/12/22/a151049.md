In the last week, we finished the first round, and now there are new matchups, and public opinion matters in a whole new way. And guess what, on CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC -- they keep saying the same tired and wrong things they were saying last week and the week before. It's just a horse race to them. Nothing matters but the election in November 2020.
