I've noticed recently that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpjtCv4vMGA&feature=youtu.be">expanding an embedded tweet</a> is painfully slow the first time you do it on an item on the blog. I did a bit of debugging and found the bottleneck, and fixed it. So now clicking on a wedge to view a tweet should be instantaneous. :boom:
