Worth watching many times. The <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/mr-robot-series-finale-recap-season-4-episode-12-and-13.html">Vulture synopsis</a> is great, obviously it's entirely spoilers, as is this post. I came to a different conclusion than <a href="https://www.vulture.com/author/vikram-murthi/">the author</a>. The big question of this episode and the entire series it turns out is <i>Who Is The Real Elliot?</i> For that I got the same answer Time had for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)">POTY in 2006</a>. We're all Elliot, having constructed a more agreeable version of ourselves to share with the world, hiding who we are many levels deep, like Inception. It's recursive, Mr Robot says. You wake from one dream to find yourself in another and another.I imagine many people will dislike the end, the same way they didn't like the end of Battlestar Galactica. Some of the story is real, some of it matters, but in the end not much actually changed. Mr Robot asks us to look at ourselves and our families and friends, and how much of it is what we wish it were, vs how much is as it actually is.
