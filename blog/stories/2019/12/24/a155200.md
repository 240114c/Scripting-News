What I want most for Christmas is to do a final build of the original <a href="http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html">XML-RPC site</a> as a static Manila site, so the 1998 version that's about to be retired is safely preserved for the future. The problem is outlined <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/141">here</a>. I could have answered the question myself, in 2002. Any help from an old school Frontier developer would be much appreciated. :boom:
