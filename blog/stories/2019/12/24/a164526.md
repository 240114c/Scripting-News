# A chicken or an egg?
Something cute I did a few days ago. I wondered, if Twitter could handle the full text of blog posts as I've been advocating, how could it work. I came up with an approach, and implemented my side of it. 

If you look at the source of a recent post here, such as <a href="view-source:http://scripting.com/2019/12/24/164526.html">the one</a> you're reading right now, you'll <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/theMeta.png">see</a> a "twitter:body" meta element in the header. Its content attribute is a base64-encoded markdown version of the post. There's a minimal amount of HTML in the post for basic features that markdown can't do. It's something Twitter could experiment with right now, if there's a developer there who thinks this is interesting.

My next project for when I have a few hours to play will be to mock up how Twitter might implement their side of it, from a UI point of view. 

PS: Of course this data is there for any other curious developer who wants to play with the idea. That's kind of how RSS got bootstrapped between 1997 and 1999. ;-)
