# A chicken or an egg? :smile:
Something cute I did a few days ago. I wondered, if Twitter could handle the full text of blog posts as I've been advocating, how could it work. I came up with an approach, and implemented my side of it. 

If you look at the source of a recent post here, such as the one you're reading right now, you'll see a "twitter:body" meta element in the header. It's content attribute is a base64-encoded markdown version of the post. There's a minimal amount of HTML in the post for basic features that markdown can't do. It's something Twitter could experiment with right now, if there's a developer there who thinks this is interesting.

My next project for when I have a couple of hours to play will be to mock up a way Twitter might implement their side of it, from a UI point of view.
