I'm reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a> by Phillip K Dick. A small part of the story is the basis for the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner">Blade Runner</a>. A bounty hunter and artificial humans. There's a test that determines if someone is human or android, based on the ability to empathize. Androids don't empathize, humans do. It occurs to me that the online world we have created limits ourselves to androidly behavior. Empathy is not very common.
