I'm continuing to struggle getting the old XML-RPC Manila site to open and render in today's OPML Editor. I really want to get that site fully restored before moving on. I posted a note <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/frontier-user/m9wdhmLRii8/nwUU7JRCCwAJ">on the Frontier-user list</a> where in 2015 they were talking about this stuff but never got to the resolution. When this is done I want to have an app you can run that converts a Manila site to a folder of HTML files. So we never forget how to do this again. I feel the weight of all the good work we did, and how embarrassed I am that we tried so hard to preserve things, and so far have utterly failed, at least in this one important example.
