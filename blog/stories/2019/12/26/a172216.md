I went to <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/12/13.html#When:9:07:42PM">New Orleans</a> after <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/12/14.html">Katrina</a>. I knew the <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/12/15.html">city</a> because I went to college <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/12/16.html#When:1:20:10PM">there</a>. I think there will be a lot of Katrinas, I don't think anyone who knows disagrees. The city was devastated. It might have been technically possible to do something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center">Rockefeller Center</a> Christmas tree, in New Orleans, in the aftermath of Katrina, but no one would waste the effort and it would seem <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/09.html#a205150">tone deaf</a> a term people like these days. We're on the cusp of that. It still seems normal now to burn carbon like that, but in not much more time, we'll wonder how we ever took pleasure in such extremely negative images of how we destroyed our way of life. Another example. I was living in NYC during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy">Sandy</a>. I was 30 blocks north of the blackout line, on the good side. I had electricity, but everything south of 23rd St was blacked out for weeks. After a while I ventured on foot into the blacked out area. On the <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/07/14/142503.html">walk</a> back <a href="http://scripting.com/threads/november2012.html#noMarathon">uptown</a> I went through Times Square. You could see it shining all the way downtown, from the blacked out part. Such extremes, amazing no one thought to turn the lights of Times Square down while the lower part of the city was living in the dark, or trying to.
