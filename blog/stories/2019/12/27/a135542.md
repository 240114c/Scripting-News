During the 2016 election I watched reruns of The West Wing and found it relaxing, to be able to visualize a government run in a human and intelligent way. Last night, looking for something to watch, I spotted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)">The Newsroom</a> on <a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-newsroom">HBO</a> and thought I would give it a try. Perfect choice. Another Sorkin show, a bit dated, in terms of tech very dated, but who cares. It's a bunch of actors, some good and famous reading Sorkin dialog about how news would work if it worked well. I've just watched the first three episodes, it's an incredible antidote to the way news is these days. Highly recommended, and as I step through it I expect to have more to say. BTW, it's available for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Newsroom-Season-1/dp/B00CW8DRU8">streaming</a> on Amazon.
