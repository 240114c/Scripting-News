<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/31/sayBlockchainAgain.png" border="0" align="right">The picture of <a href="https://pulpfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Jules_Winnfield">Jules</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction">Pulp Fiction</a> is from (I think) the first scene of the movie. Here's the actual quote. "Say 'what' again. Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker, say what one more Goddamn Time!" As Will Campbell says <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Samuel-L-Jackson-quotes-from-Pulp-Fiction">on Quora</a>: "This entire movie is basically one bag of brilliant quotes." True. As I slog my way through the end of the last season of The Newsroom, I realize that some script writing is basically one big bag of terrible quotes. Inserted into actual conversations. And the director makes the characters scream the awful quotes as if they're being tortured. It gets so bad at times I turn the volume off. I dream of the characters killing each other in a Scarface-like ending. I think I have to go back into therapy to find out why I need to see the very end of this terrible show. (BTW one in five scenes is actually pretty good, like every scene with the Assistant Deputy EPA Administrator. And every scene with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Munn">Olivia Munn</a> is amazing. She's magnetic.)
