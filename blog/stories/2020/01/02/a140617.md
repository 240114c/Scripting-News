<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/25/blackLab.png" border="0" align="right">Soon we'll be able to write the epitaph of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony">Melo</a> as a basketball player. If I were to write it today it'd go like this. Melo is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James">LeBron</a> and he's not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Smith">JR Smith</a>. LeBron is a general, a warrior. JR Smith is a joker, prankster, doper, partier. All three can shoot like nobody's business. Melo is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever">Black Lab</a>. He's a pet. He should have been teamed up with LeBron or someone like him. He'd make a great #2. But he was miscast as the hero of the Knicks, so the Melo Knicks were losers. But because he's so sweet and he has a great shot, New York loves Melo.
