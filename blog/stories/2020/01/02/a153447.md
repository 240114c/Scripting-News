Speaking of Facebook, yesterday I posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1123011587906245">something</a> intended to be wistful and introspective that some people took as a cry for help. Funny how that works. I said this: "Honestly I never thought Iâ€™d make it to 2020." Now it's 100 percent my fault there was confusion. Going back to the 1960s, when we had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_cover">duck and cover drills</a> in school, we all thought for sure we'd die in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust">nuclear holocaust</a> long before 2020. If you had asked me then what were the chances I'd be alive in 2020, I probably would have said "No one will be alive in 2020." But here we are. :boom:
