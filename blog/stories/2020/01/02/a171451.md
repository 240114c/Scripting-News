If the NYT covered NYC as they cover FB they would never run a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/sports/carmelo-anthony-knicks-trailblazers.html">piece</a> like this about the Knicks. What they fail to convey in their reporting, probably because they don't feel it, is that FB is much larger than NYC. And as diverse and interesting.
