Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">Jack</a> -- <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1212954848666234880">this</a> is ridiculous. Why can't we use the native text capabilities that all our computers have? This is an embarrassment not just for @twitter, but for the entire tech community. We <i>have</i> to do better than this.
