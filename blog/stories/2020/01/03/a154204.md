Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">Jack</a> -- <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1212954848666234880">this</a> is ridiculous. Why can't we use the native text capabilities that all our computers and mobile devices have? This is an embarrassment not just for Twitter, but for the entire tech community. We <i>have</i> to do better than this.
