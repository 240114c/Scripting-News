Yesterday I added a new image type to Old School, the blogging platform I use to write Scripting News. I can now add an image to a post that is not in the right margin, it's centered on the page, above the text that serves as its caption. This is an example of such a post. Then I added a nice border, and padding, and made the text a bit smaller to be more like a caption.
