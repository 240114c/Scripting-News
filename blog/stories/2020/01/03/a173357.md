# Inline images in Old School
Wherein I report a new feature added yesterday. 
* Yesterday I added a new image type to <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html">Old School</a>, the blogging platform I use to publish "Scripting News". I can now add an image to a post that is not in the right margin, it's centered on the page, above the text that serves as its caption. This is an example of such a post. Then I added a nice border, and padding, and made the text a bit smaller to be more like a caption.
