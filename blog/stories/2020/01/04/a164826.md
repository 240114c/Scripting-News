BTW, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/iran-fallout-soleimani-assassination-200104091122122.html">this</a> isn't the first time the US has assassinated an Iranian leader. In Iran they remember that we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">killed</a> a democratically elected president, in 1953, and installed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi">puppet</a>. We never admitted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Mosaddegh">Mossadegh</a> assassination. This time, we rushed, because of Trump's naive narcissism and failure to think a couple of steps ahead, to claim credit for Solemani's death.
