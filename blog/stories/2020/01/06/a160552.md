The thing that was so frustrating about the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/amp/article/156096/death-good-internet-inside-job-decade-hell">piece</a> from Jason Linkins in the New Republic is that he represents the kind of users we need on the open web. They see it as we deserted them, but as a developer who needs smart driven creative and friendly users, when you guys left, and decided to pour your brilliance into Twitter and Facebook instead, you helped drive the downward spiral. Users matter. That's the thing I've never been able to communicate to users. Stop being sheep. Choose. It may be a little harder, you may have to give up some features at first, but if you support a creative individual developer, you could be amazed at the new power they create for you. Work with developers who make tools you like. Help them.
