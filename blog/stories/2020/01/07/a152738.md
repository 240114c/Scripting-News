<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/07/silo.png" border="0" align="right">Yesterday when I posted the instructions for <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/06/153015.html?title=sharingOnFacebook">how to share</a> one of my blog posts to Facebook, in addition to trying to help a friend, I wanted to see for myself what the instructions would look like, in writing, without too much detail and without any steps omitted. The moral of the story is this. Come on Facebook, re-join the open web. Let's make it easy for people to do their writing outside Facebook for sharing inside. Let's make the wall of your silo so permeable that it ceases to be a silo.
