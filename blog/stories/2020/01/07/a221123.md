In 1996, I <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html">wrote a story</a> for Upside, a dream really. I dreamt I was the CEO of Apple. Before Steve came back. I would buy a song, and make a new computer and drop the rest, and focus on getting developers to ship new products. Not all that different from what Steve did when he came back, except the part about developers. :boom:
