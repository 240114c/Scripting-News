I got curious about the current <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21056029/dot-org-icann-chairman-nonprofit-cooperative-ethos-capital">controversy</a> over .org domains. So I <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1214917630848581634">asked</a> on Twitter: What's the concern over .org being privatized? How would that affect the .org domains you and I have registered? I haven't really been following this, should I?
