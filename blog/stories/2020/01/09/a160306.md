# Candidate Bloomberg
A couple of pieces just floated through my river. 
1. Maybe <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/michael-bloomberg-president-democrats-beat-trump.html">Nominating Bloomberg</a> for President Isnâ€™t a Crazy Idea 
2. <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1215301568972632070">Biden, Bloomberg</a> have largest leads against Trump in Michigan poll

Amazing. And Bloomberg is just getting started.

What people (mostly journos) overlook with Bloomberg is that he gets two very important things for a presidential candidate:
1. Media
2. Tech

Think about who he is and how he thinks and how he made his fortune. A presidential campaign is not that different from his news org.
