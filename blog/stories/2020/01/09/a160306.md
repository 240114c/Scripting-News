# Candidate Bloomberg
A couple of pieces just floated through my river. 
1. Maybe <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/michael-bloomberg-president-democrats-beat-trump.html">Nominating Bloomberg</a> for President Isnâ€™t a Crazy Idea 
2. <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1215301568972632070">Biden, Bloomberg</a> have largest leads against Trump in Michigan poll

Amazing. And Bloomberg is just getting started.

What people (mostly journos) overlook with Bloomberg is that he has mastered two very important things for a presidential candidate:
1. Media
2. Tech

Think about who he is and how he thinks and how he made his fortune. A presidential campaign is not that different from his news org. In a way it's as if Steve Jobs left Apple, was mayor of NYC for 12 years, took some time off, made some more money and then decided to run for president. Bloomberg has mastered media and tech as much as Jobs ever did. Very different styles, but similar levels of accomplishment. Do not underestimate Bloomberg. 

Nominating Bloomberg is not a crazy idea. He's a good fit for the country. A nice rebound from Trump.
