I have a bunch of things on my mind ready to go this morning, including the next in a series of voicemailcasts with Doc Searls, a defense of XML when used as an object serializer, and the awful tendency of techies, esp those who work at Google, to have little respect for stuff that works, always wanting to reinvent without using their supposedly brilliant minds to evaluate their approach. Probably a few other things I'm not remembering at the moment.
