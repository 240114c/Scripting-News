You want to know how bonded Doc and I are. That <a href="http://scripting.com/1999/11/15.html">day in 1999</a> when we got his blog started, I saw he had a blue box in his office. I asked what it is. He didn't really know. I took it home with me, I didn't even ask permission. I realized even at the time this was nervy of me, but Doc happy that I did. Turns out it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_Qube">Cobalt Qube</a>, a revolutionary product, an idea that seemed like the future in 1999, but sadly its future has yet to arrive. Hopefully this decade it will. (On second thought maybe it was the precursor of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>?)
