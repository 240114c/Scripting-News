BTW, I recall now that there is an <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/10/152333.html">issue</a> with how to represent dateTime.iso8601 and base64 types in JSON. So for now, the XML serialization can represent types that JSON cannot. Instead of having religious discussions, we should talk about how we want to deal with this.
