# The impentetrable Shorenstein
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/drummer.png" border="0" align="right">Speaking of Harvard, when I was a fellow there, one of the members of our <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/bloggroup/">Berkman Thursday</a> group was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_MacKinnon">Rebecca MacKinnon</a>, who was a fellow at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorenstein_Center_on_Media,_Politics_and_Public_Policy">Shorenstein Center</a>, which was the rough equivalent of Berkman but for journalists. Previously she had been a CNN reporter from Beijing and Tokyo. Her fellowship was a turning point in her career. She went on to start <a href="https://globalvoices.org/">Global Voices</a>, a blogging network, among other pursuits. 

She got me together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones_(journalist)">Alex Jones</a>, a former NYT reporter, who was then the director of Shorenstein. To say he was blog-skeptical would be an understatement. He typified all the arrogance and fear of blogging in journalism, with what I saw as false confidence, bravado, I guessed, to try to keep me, and what I represented to him, at arm's length. We probably met just twice, maybe even once. I remember a contentious somewhat friendly conversation at <a href="https://www.henriettastable.com/">Henrietta's Table</a>. 

I personally asked Jones to come to the second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon">BloggerCon</a>. He came. I watched him and joined in conversations with him at times. He appeared to be having the time of his life. And why shouldn't he? Here was a room full of sources, people who knew about something he was actually very interested in, and they didn't have to be coerced into talking about it. There was a ton of enthusiasm in the room. They were exploding with ideas, because of the huge potential of this space in 2004.

But after the BloggerCon we went back to our corners, staring at each other, unsure of how to communicate. By now <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/alex-jones-leave-shorenstein-center-july-1-2015/">Jones has retired</a>, his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicco_Mele">replacement</a> is a former famous blogger, the guy who did the blogging at the Dean campaign in 2004, really breakthrough stuff, and yet nothing has changed. Shorenstein is still a bastion of professional journalism, and ideas from blogging don't penetrate. 

We should all be working together. I said it then, keep pounding the table, beating the drum. No reason to stop.
