Andrew Shell opens a <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewshell/status/1216370917225517056">thread</a> on Twitter for OverCast, an iOS podcast client, asking why he was unable to subscribe to Scripting News. Turns out OverCast doesn't like titleless posts. I don't use OverCast myself, so I can't offer specific advice, but it is not acceptable to use the file name as a title. That's not what the file name is for. I described the <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216404689719365634">use-case</a> in a tweet (of course without a title).
