Andrew Shell opens a <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewshell/status/1216370917225517056">thread</a> on Twitter for <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>, an iOS podcast client, asking why he was unable to subscribe to <a href="https://scripting.com/rss.xml">Scripting News</a>. Turns out Overcast doesn't like titleless posts. I don't use Overcast myself, so I can't offer specific advice, but it is not acceptable to use the file name as a title. That's not what the file name is for. I described the <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1216404689719365634">use-case</a> in a tweet (of course without a title, tweets don't have titles). Vendors tend to ignore advice on these issues, and that's kept us from growing. I used to budge for them on this issue, but decided in 2017 to stop. All the compromises meant that my blog disappears. Bottom-line: I put podcasts on title-less posts. <i>That's never going to change. </i>
