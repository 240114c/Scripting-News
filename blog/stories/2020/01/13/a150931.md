<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/13/davesCoffee.png" border="0" align="right">I'm having the best time writing my blog these days. What makes the difference? You. I play my blog the way a musician plays the piano or guitar. I can hear what I play, but I'm most interested in what you hear. I'm not running <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">McDonalds</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/">Starbucks</a>, I've got a little <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-mud-club-woodstock-2">coffee shop</a> in town. I serve the drinks, tell stories, decorate the place, choose the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html">music</a> and lighting, bring in guests, all to pass the time in the most Dave-friendly way I can. I look for others doing their own things, so we can perform together. Our ideas influence, are tested and improved on. I'm back in the 90s and all of a sudden there's <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/01/13/ahugechunkofbluesky.html">blue sky</a> in every direction. All because, imho, in <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">2017</a>, I decided to be myself again. :boom:
