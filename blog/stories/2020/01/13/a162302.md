I tuned in a bit of CNN and NBC yesterday, they were obsessing about the president's offhand claim/lie that he thought there were four embassies being targeted by the assassinated Iranian general. By now they should know Trump-speak. When he says he "thinks" something that means he made it up. What's the point in wasting so much time on it, when everyone with a mind understands exactly what he was saying.
