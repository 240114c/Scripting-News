The next president should be creating a new social net for governance that involves all the voters who want to be involved. American citizens of voting age only. Doing real things to make America work better in every way, especially politically. I wrote this idea up in <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/21/theWhiteHouseWebsite.html">2009</a> as Obama took office and didn't follow through on the promise (imho) of his campaign. Sanders is a nice guy for sure, but he can't do the organizing we need to do (see <a href="#a180053">above</a>). It's not something you can delegate. I think Bloomberg may get this, but I'm not sure. The politicians running for office are still very old school, and Sanders is the oldest of them.
