<a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/13/docToDave.m4a">DocCast 2.0</a>. This is an interesting medium because unlike other podcasts I've listened to Doc on, in this mode he gets to talk as long as he wants and can pause, and say whatever you want. Anyway I've decided I'm going to build a basketball court so when you visit we can meditate over shooting hoops. Anyway. Focus is the thing. Creating a groove. And making each other more powerful. That's going to be my next chapter. I do want to hear about your experience with Medium. We all have our own stories. I also want to tell you a story about Dave Bunnell. And why walking is the best.
