If you're working in Node.js and need to generate an RSS feed, you're welcome to use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/daverss">the package</a> I wrote for use in all my apps. Follow the new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/rss/blob/master/examples/app/test.js">example app</a> to get an idea how it works. Just create two simple JavaScript objects, and call rss.buildRssFeed, and it creates a valid RSS 2.0 feed. It's really solid, burned in and tested in a wide variety of readers and aggregators. Variants of this code have been generating RSS feeds since (oy) 1999.
