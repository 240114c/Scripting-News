<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/drummer.png" border="0" align="right">On Sunday I wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/12/155518.html?title=theImpentetrableShorenstein">piece</a> about the walls journalism puts up to keep the rest of us only speaking in the aggregate, to all our detriment imho. There are experts all over the place, who can provide fresh perspectives on the news, to engage people's minds, and set examples for creative approaches. I lamented that even though there is a former outstanding blogger running <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/">Shorenstein</a>, one of the leading university think tanks for journalism, the walls remain, and we're no closer to fulfilling the opportunities created in the early web. <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nicco-mele">Nicco Mele</a>, the blogger I was referring to, is no longer in charge of Shorenstein. I was so-advised by two former colleagues. I'm <i>really</i> out of the loop, that's for sure. Anyway, the new director is <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/nancy-gibbs?_ga=2.187920296.1420702108.1579015693-1352129629.1577806700">Nancy Gibbs</a>. Best of luck and please let me know if there's any way I can help. :boom:
