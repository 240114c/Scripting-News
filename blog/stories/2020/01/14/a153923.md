My friends, they're both perfectly awful choices for president. Bernie is still living in the 60s. He has no ideas about the world as it exists today. Ask him. Second, Warren is a Harvard professor. She's not of the people. She's more comfortable in the faculty lunchroom, making snide jokes about the little people. They're both incredibly terrible choices to run the country starting in 2021. Neither will get done what they say they will, that will require team-building skills which neither have, and compromise, which means you have to listen. Even Obama, a relatively young person, was totally unprepared to deal with foreign hacking of our election. There's a reason Bernie doesn't have any apps on his phone. I bet he doesn't know what an app is or what the capabilities of mobile devices are. If he did, I think he'd be screaming about it in the special way Bernie screams. :rocket:
