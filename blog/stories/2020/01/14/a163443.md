Doc, stay with the Voice Memo app on your iPhone. It's like using the iPhone as your default camera. It fits in your pocket. It's probably there when you have an idea. So many other things.  Including <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html">fat tweets</a>. A pitch for Fargo the TV show. Doug Engelbart and the tech he carried with him. Shedding projects as we get older. David Bunnell's story. My grandmother. Creating a groove.
