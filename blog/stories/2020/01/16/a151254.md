This might be one of them. Trump has always reminded me of famous Jewish comedians. He borrows bits from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers">Joan Rivers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles">Don Rickles</a> and this <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1217803526564347904">clip</a> reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield">Rodney Dangerfield</a>, with his self-deprecating humor. He talks about his hair as being magnificent. Everyone in the room must realize his hair is bizarre and ugly. He'd look a lot better if he just got a normal haircut for a bald 73-year-old guy. What does he see when he looks in the mirror? Does he still see the young Donald, or does he see the old fool the rest of us see. Of course the press helps sell his buffoonery. It's our way of laughing at ourselves. Look what the great USA has been reduced to. We used to see ourselves as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Sam">Uncle Sam</a>, now we look in the mirror and see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_the_Clown">Bozo the Clown</a>.
