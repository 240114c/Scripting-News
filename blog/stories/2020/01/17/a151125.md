Neat new trick in my blog. When I generate links to titled posts, I put the title in the link, after the question mark in the URL. <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/11/180743.html?title=naughtonOnFacebook">Example</a>. The browser ignores it, as does the JavaScript code in the page. It's there to provide a human-readable title for the post. You might ask, why not just make the title the link? We did that, for many years, but then you couldn't change the title, or the URL would get out of sync with the title. It's more honest imho to just give each post a URL that is not a function of the title. But it's still nice to have it present. So there you go, a neat solution and an honorable tradeoff.
