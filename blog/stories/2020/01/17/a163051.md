<a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/17/docCastThursday.mp3">Doc's podcast for the day</a>. This time he has a <a href="http://instantoutliner.com/f6">public outline</a> with notes. I'm going to do some work on the outline reader. Creating a groove. I updated the outline reader software to hot-up his links, to make it a bit more readable on a big screen, and a lot more readable on mobile devices. It's been a long time since I touched that code, I actually had a hard time finding it.  :smile:
