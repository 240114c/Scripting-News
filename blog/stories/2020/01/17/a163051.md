<a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/17/docCastThursday.mp3">Doc's podcast for the day</a>. This time he has a <a href="http://instantoutliner.com/f6">public outline</a> with notes. I'm going to do some work on the outline reader. Creating a groove. I offer Doc a menu of choices of ways to communicate. I build on the one he picks. BTW, I can edit these files, so I will link up his URLs manually and think about how to do it automatically. I also need to make the reader work better on mobile devices.
