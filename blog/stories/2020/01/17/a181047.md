I really liked <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jojo-rabbit">Jojo Rabbit</a>, even though it got mixed reviews. You start out wondering what the hell they're doing, but in the end it's a good simple little story that has a lot of meaning. A sort of lite version of Handmaid's Tale. I really liked that Rebel Wilson was in it, a good fit, as was the chief Gestapo guy, and Jojo's best friend. What's not to like? It's a good movie for our times.
