I've heard a dozen reports about the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/15/robert-hyde-lev-parnas-099511">mystery</a> of how Parnas's friend from Connecticut knew the ambassador's movements and not one person has said that it could be because someone hacked her Google account by phishing her. You don't have to infiltrate the embassy to do that.
