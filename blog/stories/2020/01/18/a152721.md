I've heard a dozen reports about the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/15/robert-hyde-lev-parnas-099511">mystery</a> of how Parnas's friend knew the ambassador's movements and no one has said it could be because someone hacked her Google account via phishing. You don't have to infiltrate the embassy to do that.
