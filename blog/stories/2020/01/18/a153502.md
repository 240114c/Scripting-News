Now that I've <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/17.html#a211547">said it</a>, RSS really is not a good way to read my blog. The right way is to wait until the day is over and read all of it from top to bottom. That's the way I put it together. It's a daily cycle thing. For now <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">subscribe</a> to the email. We may need a new kind of reader that doesn't have the limits of email (I'm well aware of them, having written my own email distribution software) and RSS (ditto).
