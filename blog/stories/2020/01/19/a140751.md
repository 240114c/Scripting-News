<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/19/kingTrump.png" border="0" align="right">I was corrected yesterday when I used the word "exonerate" in a tweet. People felt "acquit" was the correct term for what happens if Trump is absolved (heh another verb) by the Senate. The <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=acquit">thesaurus</a> thinks they're synonyms btw. Another verb would be "annointed," because no doubt a decree will follow from King Trump I (his new title, no sarcasm) requiring everyone to say nice things about him, or their charge cards won't work to buy groceries in the future. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System">social credit</a> an innovation of the Chinese.
