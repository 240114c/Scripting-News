We are at a terrible moment. Until Trump was impeached and the articles were delivered to the Senate, there was always something more to do. But this is the end. And while that was happening, Trump nearly started World War III. Clearly his motives, as with Ukraine, were entirely personal. Trump, post-acquittal, will be the monarch, in control of a hugely powerful military, economy and lest we forget it, the people who make up all this power, Americans. With new tricks that the Chinese are working on, and no doubt Silicon Valley is as well, quietly. for now, an American monarch will be all-powerful, able to reach into personal relationships in ways the Soviet Union couldn't dream of. If by some miracle the Senate votes to turn back, then we will have just barely dodged a bullet. But it seems more likely we're going straight into the fire without even trying to hit the brakes.
