A couple of worthwhile podcasts. Brian Lehrer's <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/767280204/impeachment-a-daily-podcast">Impeachment podcast</a> is the adult version of what you hear on cable news. It still focuses on process and horse races but it goes into more detail, Lehrer has a sharp mind, and is a great interviewer, so you learn more. And <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money">Planet Money</a>, always good, has a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796799769/episode-964-billboards">piece</a> on privacy and billboards. I kept wanting to show them their own <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/10/09/655921710/chinas-social-credit-system">story</a> about social credit in China. No longer are the concerns about privacy theoretical and narrow. Our government has the same technical capability. So this is not a joke, nothing to laugh about.
