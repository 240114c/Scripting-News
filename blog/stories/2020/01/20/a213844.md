There's a <a href="http://scripting.com/rssArchive/">folder</a> on scripting.com called <a href="http://scripting.com/misc/rssArchive.zip">rssArchive</a>. It has a lot of files in it going back to 2000. They all appear to be RSS files. I have no recollection how these files were created. But it might be interesting to have a look to see how my RSS support may have changed at times.
