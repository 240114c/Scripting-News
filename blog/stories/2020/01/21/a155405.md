And <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/21/daveRetortToDoc.m4a">my retort</a> to Doc. I cover a lot of ground, tying together all the threads on Scripting News. We're headed to a China/Soviet Union type government in the US. Tech will make it so much easier. Doc was right there will be a lot of angst about all this. But forget the election, and forget Congress. It's over. He not only will be able to ignore the Constitution, he also has Barr, who is infinitely more than Sessions. And Attorney General is so central to the functioing of the US govt. But unlike everyone else, I don't take it as a given that the Repubs will acquit. They're smart people, they must see the danger. Here's an outcome most people don't consider, what if a majority vote to convict, but not enough to remove him. That's a third outcome no one seems to consider.
