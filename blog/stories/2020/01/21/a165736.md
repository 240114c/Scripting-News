Re posting a nightly digest in the RSS feed. Been down that road in other contexts. Feed readers are so  inconsistent, the result would be garbage for many if not most people. The platform is good at doing what it does. The developers are completely deaf. It wasn't easy to find an email format that works well enough across email clients, and it still looks mangled for some people. Email has only been an approximation of what works. To do this right, I'm going to write the software myself.  I've spent 20-plus years waiting for collaboration. Fuck it, I'm not waiting any more. Shouldn't have waited in the first place. Wasn't thinking clearly about this.
