# How your iPhone will enslave you
First the government insists that Apple help police to access the data on encrypted phones. This is already underway. Then, the next steps:
* A new app from the US government manages your identity and social credit. It's like a passport and wallet in one. 
* You can't quit or uninstall it.
* You can't turn off location services or its access to the microphone and camera.
* You will use it to vote. 
* It's required that you carry it at all times. Charged.

The new luxury accommodations will be in the rare parts of the world where there is no internet access. You can go to these places to rendezvous with forbidden friends and lovers.
