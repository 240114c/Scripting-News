<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/23/chips.png" border="0" align="right">I just did a <a href="http://instantoutliner.com/fc">transition</a> on instantoutliner.com. Complete rewrite of the server from top to bottom. I want to do a bunch of development work here, so I had to have a clean foundation. If you published an outline in the last few days, I might have lost the link to it. It shouldn't have happened but it did. And thanks again to Doc Searls for helping be the other side of <i>users and developers party together. </i>It's the formula that works.
