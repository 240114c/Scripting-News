He might not be removed but is not acquitted either. Say the vote is 55 to convict vs 45 to acquit. He remains president, but a majority of the Senate voted to remove him. That's not a win. It shakes his tree. "Keep fucking with us and maybe lose some more support in the Senate and maybe next time we have enough votes to put you out." Before you say that's not going to happen, it might. The Repubs are at least as savvy as we are (heh, we're babes in the woods compared to <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/04.html">McConnell</a>), and know that some of their senators come from purple states like Maine, Colorado and Arizona. And there may be other senators who may want to vote to convict because they're more independent, like <a href="https://www.romney.senate.gov/">Romney</a>, <a href="https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/">Murkowsky</a> and <a href="https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/">Alexander</a>, for example. The Repubs have room to help some of those senators without giving up ten more months of stacking the courts with unqualified Republicans. They might want to send a signal to El President√© that the US isn't <i>quite</i> his banana republic yet. It's not an impossible outcome. It's all negotiable in politics.
