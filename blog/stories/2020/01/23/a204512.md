So far people seem to like the <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/22.html#a223957">RSS version</a> of the nightly email. I don't like the way it looks in readers, and I want more features, but if that's where some people want to read my stuff, of course I'm happy. The important thing is that you read, listen and watch (and think of course).
