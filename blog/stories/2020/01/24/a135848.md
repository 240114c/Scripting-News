I got a couple of reports from people who use the Mail app on iPhones to read the <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly email</a>. The contents of the mail only fills a portion of the window horizontally.  I am able to reproduce the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/24/emailLooksCrappy.png">problem</a> here. Apparently previously it filled the space. I've started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/146">thread</a> to gather info about this. I don't know how to debug this, but I will try.
