I also continue to get reports, expected, that the RSS version of the nightly emails looks crappy in RSS readers. When I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/20/144219.html?title=rssRethinkDay2">say</a> RSS needs a re-think, this is what I'm talking about. A base of apps that were designed to copy a non-conforming app that's now <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/about/">gone</a>. Not a good situation. So RSS is good for what it's good for, but don't try to push it to new places. Email is better, but not much.
