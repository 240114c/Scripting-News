Suppose for the sake of argument, I try to make you happy and kill every political idea I have, and don't post it on my blog. Great. You're happy. You feel powerful. But then someone else wants me to stop writing about tech ideas that come to me, because it makes them feel inferior because last week I posted one they don't understand. Keep going, eventually there's nothing left here. I've been doing this for over 25 years. By now I've heard from every control freak on the planet. My advice is this, don't slam the door on the way out. No one cares why you unsubbed. Just go away, we'll be fine without you. I also continue to get reports, expected, that the RSS version of the nightly emails looks crappy in RSS readers. When I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/20/144219.html?title=rssRethinkDay2">say</a> RSS needs a re-think, this is what I'm talking about. A base of apps that were designed to copy a non-conforming app that's now <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/about/">gone</a>. Not a good situation. So RSS is good for what it's good for, but don't try to push it to new places. Email is better, but not much.
