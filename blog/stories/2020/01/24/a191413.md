# Only two permanent Olympic venues
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/24/olympicLogo.png" border="0" align="right">We, as a world, should build one great venue for summer olympics and one for winter. 

Why? Mostly symbolic. To say to the world, to ourselves, decisively, that <i>we can work together,</i> and compromise, for the benefit of humanity and the planet.

Think about it this way, we don't build a new United Nations every four years.

Further, no more spectacular displays of carbon consumption. Those made sense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition">127 years ago</a>, at the dawn of electricity tech. Now it's rubbing salt in the wound. And it makes clear that we can and will sacrifice for our survival.

Specifically, no more <a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/">Christmas trees</a>. And turn down the lights in Times Square. You can't air condition the outdoors. (In NYC amazingly, there are places that do.)  

Symbolism first, change the way people think, shock people out of their sense of normalcy, then rebuild our civilization around the new low-carbon-emission ethos. You can tell your children and grandchildren that you remember a day when we built a new temporary city every two years for a two week athletic competition, and <i>never used it again.</i>
