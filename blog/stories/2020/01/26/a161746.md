<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLXEkM1cXNk">Video demo</a> of a new "LO2" feature Doc asked for. Put the cursor in the middle of a paragraph. Press cmd-return to split the paragraph at the cursor position, creating two headlines in the outline. Simple, but I do this all the time, with copy-paste which is more tedious and error-prone. Also going to do the inverse, cmd-backspace to merge two headlines.
