<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/147">Braintrust query</a>: Is there an icon like this:  <img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/28/fileIcon.png"> in the current version of Font-Awesome? I'd like to upgrade to the latest, but without this or something very close to it, I can't.
