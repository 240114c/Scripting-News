I hit a snag implementing Cmd-Return in "LO2". It worked fine as long as there was no HTML markup in the text, but it didn't work if it was. I explain in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_a6dEoad5c">this video</a>, to the best of my ability, why that seems like it should be utterly simple, isn't. This feature isn't released yet.
