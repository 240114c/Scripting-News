I hit a snag implementing <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/26.html#a161746">cmd-return</a> in "LO2". It worked fine as long as there was no HTML markup in the text. I explain in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_a6dEoad5c">this video</a>, to the best of my ability, why that seems like it should be utterly simple, but isn't. (This feature isn't released yet.)
