# Great coffee today
FWIW, I'm drinking some great coffee today. 

What I did differently, I looked carefully at the lines on the carafe. I had been underfilling it. This time I went to the line, exactly.

Also used fresh ground <a href="https://www.peets.com/italian-roast">Peet's Italian Roast</a>. 

The water was straight out of the tap, no filters
