# Great coffee today
FWIW, I'm drinking some great coffee today. 

What I did differently, I looked carefully at the lines on the carafe. I had been underfilling it. This time I went to the line, exactly.

Also used fresh ground Peet's Italian Roast. 

The water was straight out of the tap, no filters
