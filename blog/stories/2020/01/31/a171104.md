# Morning coffee notes
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/149">Braintrust query</a>: It appears that Electron changed how the core dialog routines work. Breakage galore, or so it seems. 

I was reviewing my blog for <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/">November 2016</a>, to see how we dealt with the shock of Trump's election and I came across a video of the unbelievably fantastic DNC 2012 speech of <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/07/jenniferGranholmIn2012.html">Jennifer Granholm</a>. We need more of this. 

Here's the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html">piece</a> I wrote on election night in 2016. 

This is one of those days I've written four posts without publishing. They'll all go out at once, in various states of completion. But it's a day of ideas. I am depressed, in the same way I was the day after the 2016 election. But I had a good night's sleep, and the coffee is good. It's cold outside, but warm inside. I have all my material needs taken care of, and I have a powerful publishing platform, and the best tools, so I'm on-balance doing ok I guess. :boom: 

Old habits die hard. I'm using an outliner that has cmd-return implemented. Yet I just split a paragraph using the old select-copy-return-paste ritual. I didn't even have to think about it. It's programmed into my subconscious at the base of my spine. It takes no conscious effort to do the keys.
