# What about the courts?
I was wondering how the courts will incorporate the Senate's decision into their interpretation of the Constitution.

Will the judge the executive as if the president was a monarch now?

They can't overrule the Senate, that seems clear from the Constitution.

Another question. What will the Repubs in the Senate do if/when Trump pushes the boundaries. 

Suppose he has a journalist killed. Lots of witnesses. He admits it. Assuming the House impeaches him, what does the Senate do? 

I'd say it's pretty likely we'll be back here soon.
