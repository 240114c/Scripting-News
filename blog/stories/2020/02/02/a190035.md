# Bojack finale, initial thoughts
<img src="http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/bojack.png" border="0" align="right">Quick thoughts on the finale of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/bojack-horseman/season-6">Bojack</a>. Spoilers follow. I think they planned the second-to-last episode as the actual final episode. Had they done that I would have said who ever thought a comedy like Bojack Horseman would try something so ambitious, and even better, pull it off. But they added one more plot twist, it's really hard to parse, and the rest of the final episode is weird and repetitive, and at the end punts the ending. Still a groundbreaking show that's often LOL funny. I <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/08/30/whyYouMustWatchBojackHorseman.html">wish</a> all my friends would watch it so we can talk about it. Now I'll take some time and read the reviews.
