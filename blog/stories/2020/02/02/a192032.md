BTW, to the tech-savvy users who are regulars here. Please pitch in and help test the new <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/01.html#a174348">release</a> of "LO2". As you can see from the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150">thread</a> on GitHub, it's really unfair to put these people through this level of debugging. They aren't up to it. And it's like pulling teeth for me to get the kind of info from them that you would likely provide in the first bug report, because you know how to do bug reports. If you've looked for a way to pitch in, this is where I need the most help. Keep an outline on "LO2". When there's a new release try editing it. Do the changes stick. Try creating a new outline. Open an existing one. Log off and log on. Go through the menus and try all the commands. We're looking for breakage, something that used to work but because of changes doesn't work now. A lot of stuff changed in this release. But most of it isn't visible to users. Help me out. This is foundational work. I need LO2 to work for people, smoothly. Thanks.
