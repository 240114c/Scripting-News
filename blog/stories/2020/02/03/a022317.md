If you get a chance listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1224428088953581569">Adam Schiff's closing speech</a> in the impeachment trial. I have a feeling a lot of people didn't hear this historic, passionate plea for America. The Repubs in Congress aren't listening, but we imho must. It's really right up there with JFK's inauguration speech in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy">1961</a>. Thanks to Schiff and the House Democrats for standing up for America.
