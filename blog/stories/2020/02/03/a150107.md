It turns out the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/150#issuecomment-581407743">source</a> of the problem that a user was experiencing with the new version of "Little Outliner" was <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a> from EFF. I gather it's something that a user can disable, so if you have "LO2" and you're running Privacy Badger, you should disable their distrust of scripting.com and then LO2 should work as it should.
