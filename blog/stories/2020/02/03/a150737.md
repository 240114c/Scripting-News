I have to say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation">EFF</a> has been a constant bummer and pain in the ass. For an organization that I should be able to support (and have, see below), they are <i>always</i> doing shit like this. When they sued the guy who claimed to have invented podcasting, they didn't return my emails or respond to my blog posts begging them not to take the approach they took. I felt it's important to get on the record how media types like podcasting come about. They didn't care. So much for being on the electronic frontier. It seems to me we should be on the same side in everything, and when we're not we should listen to each other. I gave the EFF $5K, which was then and is now a lot of money for me, when they were founded by Mitch Kapor, John Gilmor and John Perry Barlow, in 1990. I believe in the mission, but often do not believe in the implementation. Thanks for listening.
