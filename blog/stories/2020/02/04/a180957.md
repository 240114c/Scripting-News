I don't know why people take the shortcut of saying other people are <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/09/09.html#a205150">tone deaf</a>. Obviously the person who they're saying it to doesn't agree. Do they really want to argue about that? What's the point. It's like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTP_SdjD5ms">Donald Sutherland</a> is screaming and pointing at someone who is not yet possessed. Look I found a human, the accuser seems to be saying. It's not a good look.
