The only criteria for a candidate: I want someone who, when a Republican who believes in the rule of law, sees them they think -- I could vote for her. Even better, I <i>want</i> to vote for her. In this election there are two sides, one side believes in the rule of law, the other doesn't. It isn't about any issue other than that. The challenge is to say what the voters say the way they say it.
