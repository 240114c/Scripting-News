This is going to be controversial. Yesterday I signed up for the Bloomberg campaign. I take him at his word, if he isn't the nominee, he will back the actual candidate with his money and organization. I hope he starts a political social network, the one I thought Obama was <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html">building</a>, not to make money (eg FB, Twitter), but to fight back against the power of the trolls, who are completely winning. Someone has to do this, and I don't see any choice but Bloomberg.
