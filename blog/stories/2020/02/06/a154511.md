<a href="https://twitter.com/iolairemcfadden/status/1225067577204002821">Iolaire McFadden</a> has <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/2020SenateRaces">created</a> a sort of mutual fund for donations to all the Democratic candidates for Senate in the 2020 election. Your donations are divided between them. I just gave $100. It's a good idea, good for the country.
