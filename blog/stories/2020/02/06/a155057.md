Why is Trump's approval rating going up? This question came up on Brian Lehrer's fantastic <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">WNYC radio show</a> and podcast. Here's my theory. During the trial, Trump isn't controlling the public conversation. He was forced to tone it down. If he were to do that permanently, only spoke when a president would normally speak, he probably would be much more popular. With a core of followers he can say or do anything, but obviously there are some wish he would just shut up sometimes.
