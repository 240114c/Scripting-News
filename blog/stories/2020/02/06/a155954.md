Tony Haile, the founder of <a href="https://scroll.com/">Scroll</a> and Chartbeat, had a really <a href="https://twitter.com/arctictony/status/1225253452168781825">good idea</a>. When the Senate votes on something consequential, such as whether to remove the president, that we have a readout that shows the number of people the Yes votes represented, broken down by state, and the number of people the No votes represent. It would measure how far our government is from being a democracy. I would love to see this as a website.
