It's a two voicemailcast Friday. <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/05/daveToDoc2.m4a">The first one</a> is from me, to kick it off, and a response from Doc will follow in the next item. I have an <a href="http://instantoutliner.com/g4">outline</a>, but they were the notes I took before doing the podcast, I didn't clean them up, so you're seeing D2D (Dave-to-Dave) communication. I recorded this on Wednesday. And some of the items in the outline didn't make it into the cast. Still diggin.
