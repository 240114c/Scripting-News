On paper he was a better candidate than Bush. Bush won. Bush said cute shit like Big Mo. And ran racist ads about Willie Horton. The <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/07/dukakisInTheTank.png">picture</a> of Dukakis in the tank. He lost the election when asked would he favor the death penalty if someone <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1844704_1844706_1844712,00.html">murdered</a> his wife Kitty. He gave a totally rational response. They said he was cold. It stuck.
