BTW, "LO2" is just another name for "Little Outliner". There was a previous version that was quite different. So when the second version was on the way, I called it LO2. Also because typing <span style="letter-spacing: .5em">LITTLE OUTLINER</span> was a lot more work than LO2. Sorry for the confusion.
