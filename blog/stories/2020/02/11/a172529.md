This is weird. If you do a Google search for <i>What makes a weblog a weblog?</i> it links to a page on blogs.harvard.edu that's a <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">Miley Cyrus fan blog</a>. It was last updated in 2008. It's a wonder to me how this site came to have that URL. Anyway, the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html">original piece</a>, intended to last for a long time, is still present, even though Google doesn't know about it. Written in 2003, by yours truly, it was an attempt to put a marker down. This is what we were doing way back when. To the future, you know how it turned out. We had very little idea of that.
