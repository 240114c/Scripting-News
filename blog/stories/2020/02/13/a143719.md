Journalists are gunning for Bloomberg. I wish they would take a moment and just think how lost we would be now if there wasn't a Bloomberg fighting Trump. Come down from the high tower and be with us, we are fucked, you and me and everyone else who thinks. This is a war. We've run out of weapons that work, this is the last one, and you're going to try to tear it down? Why?
