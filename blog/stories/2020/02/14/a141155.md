# President Bloomberg, really a Democrat?
Since writing the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/why-democrats-should-not-nominate-bloomberg-sexual-harassment-plutocracy.html">piece</a> yesterday about Bloomberg's campaign I've done some more thinking and reading. The best piece I came across was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/why-democrats-should-not-nominate-bloomberg-sexual-harassment-plutocracy.html">this one</a> in New York by Eric Levitz. This was the moment he got me. 
* "The same personal fortune that would free the Democratic Party from cash constraints this fall would also liberate a President Bloomberg from partisan constraints once in office. If the plutocratic president decides to find common ground with a Republican Senate on Social Security cuts, what leverage will the Democratic Party have over 'their' White House?"

That's a really good question.
