Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/15.html#a161619">released</a> a new version of Concord, the outliner core of "LO2". This broke the then-current release, v1.8.6. After a report by Andy Sylvester, I quickly released v1.8.7, which works with the new Concord. The problem was that the name of the CSS file changed. The result is that the outlines <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/16/funkyScreenShot.png">looked</a> pretty horrible. To get the latest version reload the page. If that doesn't get you 1.8.7, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache">here are tips</a> for getting the browser to do a full reload.
