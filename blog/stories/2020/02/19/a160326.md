# Tweeting a thread (the plan)
Put the cursor on a headline. 

Click on the tweet icon.

We confirm you want to post X tweets.  
* First we make sure none of them are too long.
* If so, we report that instead of confirming. We move the cursor to the offending headline. 

LO2 visits all the subs and tweets them, in a thread. All linked in a reply chain starting with the first one. 

Will people use this? I don't know, but it's worth a try. Let's see what happens.
