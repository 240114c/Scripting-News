# Candidates are mirrors
Honestly, either Klobuchar or Warren are more attractive than the others. I would definitely go with Klobuchar, still.

I don't want to say anything bad about the others.

Choosing a candidate to me has nothing to do with judging the morals of the person. I have no insight into that. These "people" are images of people, not real.

You're selling a mirror to voters. It's imperfect. But when they look in the mirror do they like what it says about themselves. 

I liked looking into the Obama mirror. It says to me "we've accomplished something in my lifetime."

When I looked at HRC, I saw some level of competence, but mostly "NOT TRUMP."

Why I like Klobuchar is what I see is "This is how I see America." A compromise with the other half of the country. I think enough of us can agree that this is America for now that we might be able to restore the rule of law.
