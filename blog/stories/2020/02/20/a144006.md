# Notes on last night's debate
I were on the debate stage last night, I would have done what Bloomberg did. All these people yelling about crazy nonsense, a lot of it at me, should I join in the yelling? Fuck no.

People say Bloomberg didn't respond to the accusations. I listened to what he said, this is what I heard.
* Yes, I made a lot of money, and I'm giving it all away.
* I made jokes about women and paid for my sins. 
* A communist can't win in America.
* I'm a manager. I'm going to manage this. 
* I'm sorry for my fuckups. 

More to come, transcribing from Twitter.
