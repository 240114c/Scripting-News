# How does Twitter threading work?
This came up in an email discussion. 

Doc said he doesn't really understand how Twitter threading works. I'm not sure I understand it either, and I've implemented it in two of my tools, first "Electric Pork" and now "LO2". 

Here's how I do it.

Suppose you have a sequence of four bits of text you want to turn into a Twitter thread.

Label them A, B, C and D. 

When you create a tweet you can specify which tweet it is in reply to.

First I post A to Twitter, it is in reply to nothing (that's also one of the options).

Then I post B, it is in reply to A.

Then I post C, in reply to B.

And D in reply to C.

Twitter will display that as a thread. 

Could I have had them all in reply to A? I'm not sure. I haven't tried it.
