# How does Twitter threading work?
This came up in an email discussion. 

Doc said he doesn't really understand how Twitter threading works. I'm not sure I understand it either, and I've implemented it in two of my tools, first "Electric Pork" and now "LO2". 

Here's how I do it.

Suppose you have a sequence of four bits of text you want to turn into a Twitter thread.

Label them A, B, C and D. 

When you create a tweet you can specify which tweet it is in reply to, or you can leave it out in which case it's not a reply. This is really how programmers talk, btw. 

First I post A to Twitter, not a reply.
* Then I post B, in reply to A.

Twitter will display that as a thread. <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1231425763284594689">Like this</a>. 

Could I have had them all in reply to A? Not sure. I haven't tried it.
