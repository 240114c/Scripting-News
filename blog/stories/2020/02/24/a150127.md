# The seatbelt on my Subaru
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/24/subaruForester.png" border="0" align="right">I bought a new 2019 Subaru Forester about a year ago. It works pretty well. There are things that could work better, but I like it. It's a good car for where I live, in the mountains north of NYC. But it's not perfect. 

About the half the time the driver seatbelt gets stuck in the door. It was a hassle until now, the car's electronics thinks the door is always open. The door is closed. The car works fine.

Even worse, the battery runs down overnight and the car requires a jump start.

I took the car in for service. It's still under warranty, but Subaru wants me to pay for the repair. Estimate $500. 

I can't imagine what they think I'm doing. 

They say they can't reproduce the problem. 

Seems to me it's a design flaw. 

This is where we're stuck.
