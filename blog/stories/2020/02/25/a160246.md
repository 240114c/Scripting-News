Why didn't the NYT when it started on the web in the 90s try to do what Wikipedia has done? I have to admit, I didn't think of it at the time either, to me the function of a news org was to start fresh once a day. But this was always part of the potential of the web, create a base of info at the same time as flowing the new stuff. That's actually where we went with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+lbbs">LBBS</a> in the 80s. Did you know I was doing BBS software then? I was.
