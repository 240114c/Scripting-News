I was typing a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1233389598031650816">reply</a> to Miguel de Icaza on Twitter and went over the 280 char limit. Their thread editor doesn't work with replies, so I just kept typing, and at the end I posted a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/28/tweetScreenShot.png">screen shot</a> of what I wrote. Twitter please, the 280 char limit is bullshit. Let's go to infinite length tweets. Facebook manages to do this. It's time. Thanks.
