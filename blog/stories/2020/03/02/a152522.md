Two things to watch out for re the virus. 1. There will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy">anti-vaxer</a> types who will say the test gives you the disease, so a fair number of people will refuse to be tested. 2. The government will realize that they need to control the press to control the flow of info about the virus. Best to think about it in case it happens. People who read this blog might be the people who figure out how to distribute info even if the government is trying to stop it. Probably will be easier to do before the press is controlled.
