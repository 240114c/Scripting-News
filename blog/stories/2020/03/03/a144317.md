# My father apologized
Something really weird happened in a dream last night.

My father apologized for something. 

He's been dead since 2009.

He never apologized for anything to anyone as far as I recall, certainly not to me. He said and did plenty he should have apologized for.

I think in a weird way this is my subconscious telling me that it's ready to forgive him. 

In the dream I felt so safe and secure in the moment, I said genuinely, don't worry about it, we can fix the problem right now. Then we went to the post office and I mailed a package to someone.
