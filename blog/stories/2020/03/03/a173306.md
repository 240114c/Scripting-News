<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cys5H1O7SLQ">Demo of a new feature</a> on my blog. Spoilers are now hidden behind a placeholder. This is how it works. Warning there's a spoiler in this video about how spoilers work. Not kidding. If you haven't seen The Expanse and think you might, you should avert your eyes at the right moment in this video. <i>Sorry! </i>
