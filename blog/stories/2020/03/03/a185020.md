What sense does it make to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-by-half-percentage-point-11583247606">stimulate</a> an economy that will be crippled by lack of parts and workers? The economy will shrink, no way to avoid that. Maybe we'll need stimulus later, once (hopefully) people are back at work.
