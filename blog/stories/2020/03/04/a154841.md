<a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1583335881000">Change notes</a> for v1.8.10. Two big changes. A new File/Open dialog. And the storage server has moved to a new machine. Very important -- here are the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/156">testing notes</a>. I need a few people to go through the steps to verify that things are working as they should. Your help is much needed and appreciated. Thanks! :boom:
