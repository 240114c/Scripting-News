The <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/03/26/blockwithtimeoutForTwitter.html">Snooze for 30 Days</a> command on Facebook is great. Every network should have it. And guess what, when the timer expires, I forgot that I snoozed them, but they are still being obnoxious, so I just snooze them again. I'm soooo glad they can't tell when they've been snoozed. Oops I'm probably making all my friends think it's them. Trust me, it's not. We're cool. Namaste.
