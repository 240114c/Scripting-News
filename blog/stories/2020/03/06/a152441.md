<a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1235645351668764673">Asked on Twitter</a>: I have a Mac and an iPhone. What's the best way to get a text file from my Mac onto my iPhone. Best == least work. Lots of answers. The thing I like about email the best is that the same approach works from a browser-based app like "LO2". I can add email capabilities there so I can make a list in the outliner and email it to my phone. That will be beautiful.
