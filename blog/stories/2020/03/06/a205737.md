Found it impossible not to put my fingers in my mouth when trying to open the plastic bags for fruit and produce. Touching all kinds of surfaces that probably are infected. The place had a Thanksgiving-like feel to it. Could just be a Friday thing in late winter. I've been stocking up on canned goods. I buy about twice as much as I need every week. Also noted there is <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/06/plentyOfToiletPaperInHannafords.png">plenty of toilet paper</a> on the shelves. Apparently people here aren't so scared of running out. The only thing that was in short supply was <a href="https://www.breadalone.com/home">Bread Alone</a> bread, for some reason. I should've asked. It looks like they're not going to carry it in the future? That would be not good.
