Back in the world of the mundane, recall that I've had a problem with <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/23/125415.html">UPS</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/27/191010.html">deliveries</a> for a while, so I was amazed today when a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/09/upsTruck.png">UPS truck showed up</a>. Alas, it was just a temp driver, subbing for the permanent one. One day we will get this worked out. :shrug:
