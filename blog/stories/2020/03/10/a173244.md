We should make a <a href="http://this.how/virus/whatShouldBeClosed.opml">list of activities</a> that should come to a stop now. For example, movie theaters are done. In-person sports events. Offices, schools, mass transit. Feel free to add to the list by replying to <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1237428971748417537">this tweet</a>.
