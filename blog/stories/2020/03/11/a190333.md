<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/11/sweetBabyJames.png" border="0" align="right">Instead of listening to podcasts about the virus I started listening to a great <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Break-Shot-First-Years-Memoir/dp/B081D93GP6">audiobook</a> today -- James Taylor's memoir. The audiobook is the way to go because he plays his guitar while he's narrating. Many of his famous songs are all autobiographical. And his story is surprising. I didn't know anything about him.
