I had anxiety about Covid19 for the first time this morning. This could be it, but if it isn't, I have some great software in mind. Funny how being this scared brings out the creativity. On the other hand if this is the time to go -- I'd rather have it be in a plot of a science fiction novel than say going in my sleep. The drama of Trump's speech last night. At one point I thought he was losing it and was going to start talking like Jerry Lewis in the <a href="https://youtu.be/neEe1itDC_k?t=320">Nutty Professor</a>. I think that would have been good for everyone.
