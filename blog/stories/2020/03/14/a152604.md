On <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/12.html#a174026">Thursday</a> I recommended listening to the Daily podcast. They had an interview with NYT reporter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr">Donald McNeil</a> who explained how they fought Covid19 in China. He was on Maddow that night, and they posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/1238279302468288512">video</a> of his talk on Twitter. If you haven't seen it, stop everything, now, and watch it. You'll get so much more information about what we're up against. China appears to have beaten it. Ultimately we will have to do the same, if we don't want it to spread to everyone.
