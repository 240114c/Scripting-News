<a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/15/willWeSurviveTheRepubs.html">A story from 2008</a>. I was living in Berkeley. During the financial meltdown, I was driving on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Solano+Ave,+California/@37.8907665,-122.2923499,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857935066f30a5:0x74c6bf59ecf6d302!8m2!3d37.8907665!4d-122.2901612">Solano Ave</a> with my friend Tori. I asked if she thought the stores would still be there in a year. I was imagining we were headed for the Stone Age, and our economy would be based on barter, and a lot of us would die. Kind of the way I feel now. Tori paused and said they would still be there. And they were.
