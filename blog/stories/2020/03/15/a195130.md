<a href="https://www.facebook.com/enochchoi/posts/10102337425856651">Enoch Choi</a>: "With Cuomoâ€™s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-trump.html">request</a> for military support, I expect the army to deploy DMAT hospitals to hardest hit areas in coming days, NY, WA, CA. They deployed to Katrina when my dad and I were the first in St Bernard to arrive. Praying for my friends who volunteer in them. The demand outstripped availability there, and I expect the same as what happened then, that churches will serve the vast majority, since Red Cross/NGOs will be outstripped in capacity as well."
