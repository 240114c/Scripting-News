They sent an email that it just shipped and it'll be here by March 23. How could that be? Are they sending it via bicycle? Well, turns out it's coming from China. We should be nice to China. We need them. They're going to help me keep track of my temperature. Maybe alleviate a little of my anxiety. Now the question is will <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+ups">UPS</a> deliver it to me, or automatically return it without trying. Something they've been doing for a while now.
