Deadhead. First of her name. Dog person. Movie lover. Advocate for beets. "The first faerie off the ferry." <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/05/04/thecutelittlenut.html">The cute little nut</a>. <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/11/16/nakedjensBlissBag">That's</a> <a href="http://photos.scripting.com/2012/december/nakedjen2012">Jen</a>. Anyway, the CLN decided just as all hell was about to break loose in SLC to go to Bali. I watched it happen. I didn't say anything because I was sure lots of people were saying it. If this is what was meant to be, so be it. Anyway, as the shit began to hit the fan here, after Trump closed us off from Europe, I got word that Jen is coming home. Good. It hasn't been easy. Few flights, and lots of cancellations. But -- her flight from Bali to Seoul is at 1AM, which is 1PM Eastern. From there, I'm guessing she goes to Los Angeles and then to Salt Lake. I'm sure Jen will be Jen where ever she is. If she has to weather this out in Bali, or Seoul, or even LA. But we really do want her back in the good old US of A.
