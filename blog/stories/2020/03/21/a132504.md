Most times we can convince ourselves that in the immediate future:  1. We will remain alive and well.  2. Our friends and family will too.  What's so unsettling about the moment: Now we know that either, we will be sick or die, or some of our friends and family will. I think that's why we are all reaching out to our friends now, and re-establishing the connection, because we want to hold them close so they don't leave us. It's a good thing. In this week's <a href="https://radioopensource.org/springtime-in-the-plague-year/">Radio Open Source</a>, at the end, Andrew Sullivan talks about that re AIDS, which he experienced as a gay man in the 80s and 90s.  I experienced it as a man with a fatally sick heart in the 00s. After being fixed, I felt like I wanted to die. Weird, right? But real. We call the first feeling "normal."  Over time, this will become normal.  Then at some point, if we survive, a vaccine or treatment will come about.   And we'll go through the unsettled feeling again.
