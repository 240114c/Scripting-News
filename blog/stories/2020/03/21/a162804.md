I had to run errands into Kingston just now and heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo">Gov Cuomo's</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3h9Z4u4icM">press conference</a>. He is masterful. I feel like there's someone in charge who knows what to do and is doing it. I feel lucky to live in New York State, wish we had something approaching that kind of leadership in Washington.
