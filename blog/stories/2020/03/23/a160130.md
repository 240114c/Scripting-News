I watched the finale of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)#Season_3">season 3 </a>of The Expanse without realizing it was the last <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_3_(2018)">episode</a> of the series before Amazon took it over. It was masterful. I'm going to have to watch it again. BTW, my favorite character is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8t4czs/drummerwhat_a_character/">Drummer</a>. I am a Belter, for sure.
