I always wondered <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1242438120580186113">why</a> bike delivery people in NYC put plastic bags over the handles of their bikes. Today I <a href="https://twitter.com/polly/status/1242438758001258496">found out</a>. "It keeps your hands warm, particularly when you're biking really fast and the wind is bad. Can still access the gears and brakes this way, which you couldn't do easily in gloves."
