Let Trump ride on the NYC subway for a few hours and see <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-trump-urges-economic-restrart-early-as-next-week-2020-3">how he feels</a> then. Turning on the economy in NYC, which is probably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/business/trump-businesses-coronavirus.html">what he cares about</a>, means cramming millions of people into  virus-infested subway cars each for an hour or two every day. If Trump wants to ride with them, well I'd be impressed, and would also ask Mike Pence to be ready to assume the presidency. Trump may have forgotten that at age 74, he's in the expendible class according to his Republican friends. Make sure your will is current Mr President.
