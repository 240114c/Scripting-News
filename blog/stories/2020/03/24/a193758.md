Why America is so bad at Covid-19. It’s our attitude, there are never consequences for Americans. That’s for other people. We have wars and tax cuts at the same time. We don’t see the coffins of our returning dead. Nothing happens to us. We can’t imagine things not being normal. The generation that grew up during World War II, who experienced the Holocaust, the advent of nuclear weapons, that generation is gone now. Everyone alive today, not just boomers, have been spoiled. We're all coming awake now from a life-long trance. Each of us has had to deal with mortality as individuals, couldn't escape that. Now, for the first time in our lives, we have to deal with the mortality of our country. Don't cry for America. Now we have to grow up. Couldn't have a more perfect person in the presidency. It's easy to see he is our past. Now how do we move beyond that.
