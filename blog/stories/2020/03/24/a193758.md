Why America is so bad at this Covid-19 thing. It’s our attitude, there are never consequences for Americans. That’s for other people. We have wars and tax cuts at the same time. We don’t see the coffins of our returning dead. Nothing happens to us. We can’t imagine things not being normal. The generation that grew up during WWII, who experienced the Holocaust, and the advent of nuclear weapons, that generation is gone now. Everyone alive today, and not just the boomers, have been spoiled. We're all coming awake now from a life-long trance. Each of us has had to deal with mortality as individuals, couldn't escape that. Now, for the first time ever, we have to deal with the mortality of our country.
