<a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/24/cuomoMarch24.mp3">Audio</a> of Gov Cuomo's press conference for today. My next project is to figure out how to flow this through an RSS feed so it can be a podcast. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbrianbluestein/">Richard Bluestein</a> did the MP3. More tomorrow.
