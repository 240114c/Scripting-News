# Instant updates
I've gotten a few requests from people who get the nightly email who want more frequent updates to the <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=blog">main blog</a> and the <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a>. There are feeds for both. If you follow them in an RSS reader, you will get the items as they are posted, throughout the day.

Here are the feeds:
* <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">http://scripting.com/rss.xml</a>
* <a href="http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml">http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml</a>
