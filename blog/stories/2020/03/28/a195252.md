# What viral means
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/28/budgie.png" border="0" align="right">I heard someone parrot what the president said about how car accidents kill 65K people a year, yet we don't shut down the car industry. So why do we all have to hibernate in isolation while the scientists find a treatment or a vaccine for this killer disease. I suppose it's good to explain, one time, in one place, why a virus is different from a car accident. 

Most things I post on Twitter are not viral. One or two people may RT it, and that's it. Once in a while I post something does go viral. That means a few people RT to people who then RT it to people who then RT it, etc. Sooner or later 100K people have seen my stupid little tweet. Covid-19 is like that. If you have it, and you don't isolate, you will give it to other people, and they will give it to more people, and so on. Very quickly a million people have it. It goes viral. I'm sure Trump has used that word without really understanding what it means. 

That's the difference. 

Now why is that a problem? We'll answer that in the next lesson.
