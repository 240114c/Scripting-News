<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/29/beavis.png" border="0" align="right">Dev work: A few days ago I asked how to use regex to mash up paths for web requests. In the end I went another way, adding a long-wanted plug-in capability to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark">PagePark</a>, my labor-of-love Node-based web server. I found a really Nodey way to do it, much better imho than using eval or vm. I use <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html">modules</a>. A lot of people don't know they can be in files, not just distributed through NPM. It's a really nice way to do plug-ins, and it's made something cool possible with Little Outliner. More on that later. In the meantime I've written up the use of modules for plug-ins in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/158#issuecomment-605650163">thread</a> about regex.<i> Still diggin!</i>
