# Why hibernate?
Two reasons:
1. Increase your chance of survival when you get the virus.
2. Slow the rate of transmission of the virus.

One reason for you, another for everyone else. 

Scientists are working feverishly on treatments and a vaccine. The latter will prevent you from getting infected, but it's a long way off. But treatments could come about any day. The longer you hold on, the more likely you will survive. 

If everyone stayed in, the transmission of the virus would almost halt. You could still get it from someone you live with. But that's it. 

But we can't be perfect. We need doctors, food, electric, internet, etc. So the best we can do is slow the rate. The slower it gets, the more time we give the scientists to find a treatment or vaccine. And the better the chance you survive.
