# A story we aren't covering yet
I've privately encouraged a few reporter friends to look into what it's like to die from "CV", and report on it. 

My imagination says it's very horrible. But maybe it isn't as bad as I imagine and maybe they knock you out for the most painful parts. 

I know you can request a DNR, thinking of writing it on my body in Sharpie. But can you also request palliative treatment? 

And btw, how are supplies of the palliatives?

This is a huge story, and as far as I can see no one is covering it. It would take a lot of courage.
