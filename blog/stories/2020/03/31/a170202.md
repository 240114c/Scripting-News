"I was already cautiously optimistic that the virus is milder than we realize, because of the testing bias towards very ill patients. Now there's a little evidence that may be true, from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-28/dutch-hospital-workers-show-insidious-nature-of-coronavirus">Dutch study</a> and it would not only explain why it spreads so well, but is an argument for why 100% of the population should wear masks in public, and why we should exhaustively test healthy people as well. The more people who have already been infected with sub-clinical or no symptoms, the lower and sooner the peak will be, at least here in NYC where it's already likely to sweep the population."
