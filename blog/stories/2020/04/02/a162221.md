# JavaScript plug-ins for PagePark
This is a technical description of a new server bridge between two apps, "PagePark" and "Little Outliner" (aka LO2). It's now possible to view user-editable files through PagePark as long as they've been made public. This is how the pieces fit together. 
* PagePark is a Node-based HTTP server that has special understanding of two kinds of files -- "Markdown" and "OPML". 
* "Little Outliner" is an <a href="http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/">outline editor</a> that runs in a web browser. Its native format is OPML. 
* To really nail it, it turns this <a href="http://storage2.littleoutliner.com/users/davewiner/myOutlines/example.opml">source file</a> into this <a href="http://my.this.how/davewiner/example.opml">rendering</a>. That's it. The next step, soon, will be to present a document that explains how to edit and view these files through the new bridge.
