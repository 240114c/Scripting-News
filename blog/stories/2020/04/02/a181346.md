My poor uncle, my father's brother, was <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/01/29/myUncleSam.html">murdered</a>. I think how sad that the last person he saw was someone who had just killed him. I feel the same way about watching The Trump Show on MSNBC every evening at 6PM. He's murdering us. Why  would we want to listen to him?
