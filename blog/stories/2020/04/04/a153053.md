Heard something disturbing <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/tnyradiohour/segments/why-we-underestimated-covid-19">on WNYC</a> earlier. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Nobel laureate</a> in psychology said he was optimistic for society and pessimistic for himself. At his age, he said, the virus is basically a life sentence of staying isolated. He's 86.
