# Submitting to iTunes
I want to submit the Cuomo podcast to iTunes.

It failed in my first attempt. Here are the messages I got.
* Podcast artwork must be between 1400 x 1400 and 3000 x 3000 pixels, JPG or PNG, in RGB color space, and hosted on a server that allows HTTP head requests.
* Can’t submit your feed. There is no category tag in your feed, or the category tag is empty.
* Can’t submit your feed. There is no explicit tag in your feed, or the explicit tag is empty.

I'm trying to figure how how you're supposed to specify "podcast artwork." Guessing it's the channel-level image element. 

In any case this isn't going to be a quick thing. I have to update my RSS package to allow for the new metadata they want. And I have a feeling from some of the docs that they want us to use HTTPS, which is somewhat of a deal-stopper. Yes I know the usual arguments.
