# Narcos taught me something
An episode of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138189/narcos-mexico-review-netflix-season-two">Narcos/Mexico</a> just opened my eyes. 

Season 1, Episode 2.

A young guy with a big idea gambles big and loses because his boss is an idiot.

He's being taken off to be executed, but he's cool. He knows he's going to be killed. He took a risk and lost. He's ok with it.

Cops flag down the car, make everyone get out and they shoot everyone but the guy who was about to be killed.

The cops were part of the big deal, and they liked the smart young dude so they killed his boss and made him the new boss.

Very nicely done, and even though I had seen it before, it totally held my interest. And I was glad to see it on April 4, 2020. If this is the end, why not go out with dignity and style?

I thought it was an interesting perspective.
