Stanford University is setting up a network of Americans around the country to track their symptoms and exposure to people with CV. When <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/23.html#a154211">NakedJen</a> traveled through Seoul on her way home, she had to install a mobile app to keep a diary of her symptoms, if any. This is how they do containment, and it's great to see a similar system starting in the US, from a credible institution like Stanford. We're on the road now. Every American reader of this blog should sign up for daily reminders, and do it. If I could make it a requirement, I would. America being smart.
