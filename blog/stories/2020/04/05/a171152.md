I'm okay with people going to church as long as we can lock the doors after they're all inside. They should not be allowed to re-enter society after being so reckless with their own health. On FB they're saying they should stay inside for 14 days and those without symptoms be allowed to leave. I am reminded of the famous <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/05/never.png">New Yorker cartoon</a>. I think "never" is a better time to let them out.
