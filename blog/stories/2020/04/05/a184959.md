Highly recommend this week's Radio Open Source interview with <a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-pandemics-path/">Laurie Garrett</a> who is an eloquent expert on the pandemic. I had heard her interviewed elsewhere, this time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Garrett">she</a> gets all 40 minutes, and she's brilliant, deeply informed and passionate.
