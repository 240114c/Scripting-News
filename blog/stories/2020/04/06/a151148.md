# Tabs on scripting.com
I changed the way tabs work on the "Scripting News" home page.

There are three tabs: Blog, Links and About.

When you click on a tab, you are redirected with a url of this form:
* http://scripting.com/?tab=<i>name</i>

Where <i>name</i> is the name of the tab you're going to.

That way you always have a link to the tab in the address bar.

And the browser's Back button works. 

It used to do it all with JavaScript without redirecting.

It also no longer remembers what tab you had frontmost last time you visited the site. This was always annoying. Not a good heuristic. When I come to scripting.com 99 times out of 100 I want to see the blog. It doesn't matter what I was looking at last time I visited. 

This was suggested a long time ago, has been on my todo list ever since, and I finally got around to doing it. It's even worse than it appears. :boom:
