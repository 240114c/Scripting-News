I thought that was super interesting. Because if you met Rudy you'd have thought he'd be a Republican, at least today you would. But he wasn't at all. He was super liberal. Our whole family is. It never occurred to me that he was a communist, but he might have been, esp from the point of view of Uncle Arno (who I never actually met).
