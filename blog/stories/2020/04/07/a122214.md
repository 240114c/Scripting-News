Also, <a href="http://rudykiesler.com/">Rudy's</a> company, <a href="http://www.b340.com/">United Pioneer</a>, still exists. Apparently Salant shut it down when they went bankrupt in the 80s, and it was bought (again apparently) by Bernie Braverman, who worked for Rudy. I remember him, since I worked in the office one summer (the summer of the Watergate hearings). United Pioneer, amazingly, still exists, but they wrote Rudy Kiesler out of the story. I've seen this happen many times, even with my own work. It must run in the family. Anyway the web is amazing, the trails are there for all of this, you just have to look, and now this is part of the story too.
