It's very bad for our country, in the spirit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE">Jon Stewart's appeal</a> to the Crossfire guys so many years ago. They never did help us, and now <i>thousands of Americans are dying. </i>What will it take to wake the owners of the networks up. And the people, why are you watching this deadly animal garbage? Don't you get it? If you didn't watch they wouldn't broadcast. Don't you care about your own lives?
