When I sit down at a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1115239756974174208">lovely dinner</a>, with interesting, humor-filled friends in a beautiful spot, I am as rich as I can possibly be. A billionaire couldn't have more. I first realized this at a sushi restaurant in Sausalito, where the chef had prepared the most amazing looking and tasting <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1115618047757254656">bouquet</a> of fresh fish and rice. Literally this is as rich as you can get.
