# Biden can make a difference now
<a href="https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/1248256035661524993">Tom Watson</a>: "The push to re-open is a push for death."

Here's what I said in response. 

It's something to campaign on. Concrete. Biden can make a simple president-like statement. It's not time to even think about surrendering to the virus.

You know what else he can do? He can assemble a panel of scientists and medical doctors to keep the public informed. An hour a day, press conference style. What the CDC would be doing if Trump weren't president. I'm sure Fauci would welcome it.
