Yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon/status/1248094415752749059">Jeff Bezos visited</a> an Amazon warehouse and a Whole Foods supermarket. The video would have been hard to anticipate just a few weeks ago. Why is he walking around like that, alone, not shaking anyone's hand. If that were a scene in a movie it would win an award. Foreboding. Ominous. Weird.
