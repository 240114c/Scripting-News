I chose this route for rolling out this kind of rendering for outlines very deliberately because it didn't include blogging features. It's focused on writing. There are already countless ways to blog. But there's a common feature set between the this.how docs and Old School blogs, so any skills you pick up here will work for blogs too, if there's ever a need to go that far. I have found this format useful even though I have a blog. So when you think -- I should write some guidelines for this, or a FAQ or directions for cooking a type of bread, something that isn't of-the-moment, then you can use LO2 to write and revise it, and send people the URL of the my.this.how rendering of it.
