I have a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/164">question</a> about Apple podcasts. The new <a href="http://this.how/cuomo/">Cuomo</a> podcast shows up in my iPhone podcasts app. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/10/cuomoScreen.png">Screen shot</a>. It also shows as having updated. But when I look at the page for the podcast it only shows episodes through Tuesday. Today is Friday. Is there something wrong with my feed? I want to get this working properly. I also noted that Sunday and Monday are missing too. They are most definitely in the <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>.
