I'm getting the <a href="https://www.kinsahealth.co/">Kinsa thermometer</a> tomorrow, but I already have my <a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/health/pulse-oximeters/976760_1005860_1161882_2477346">pulse oximeter</a>, it came via Fedex on Friday. It's that <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pulse+oximeter&t=h_&ia=images&iax=images">thing</a> they put over your finger that says how fast your heart is beating and how much oxygen is in your blood. My numbers are good.
