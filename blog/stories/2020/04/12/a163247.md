Stop everything and <a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1249336590482243585">watch</a> this presentation by Prime Minister Johnson of the UK. Incredibly powerful, credible, a perfect call for the British people. Now maybe he can knock some sense into the Republican leadership in the US. Also doesn't this make you wish we had an NHS in the US. I thought this was such a noteworthy speech we added it to the <a href="http://this.how/cuomo/">Cuomo podcast</a> as a "special enclosure."
