# Zip work
I posted this earlier.
* I need to zip up a set of files in Node. Why isn't there a drop-dead simple API for doing this. Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa50ae77b8929bcad55c8b7125a6f3ba">pseudo code</a> for how I'd like to do it. If you have a suggestion you can comment on the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa50ae77b8929bcad55c8b7125a6f3ba">gist</a>. 

Since then I solved the problem, creating an NPM package, davezip (not released yet), that has the API I want, built on the <a href="https://www.archiverjs.com/">archiver</a> package. 

Will post the details after my next session.
