# The post office is fine
The post office is fine. Repubs like to say government does everything wrong but it isn't true. 

Ever try to get help from an airline? Or an ISP? 

I live in the country and we <i>depend</i> on the post office. A lot of systems would break without it. 

Trump can't be serious.
