# Lance Knobel on membership
Lance Knobel, founder of <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.com/">Berkeleyside</a>, via email:
* There's a growing group of online news organizations that do better than your <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/13.html#a184131">suggestion</a>. 
* I'm thinking of the largely nonprofit news sites that, as a matter of principle, don't have paywalls. At Berkeleyside, the way we put it is that our news coverage is probably more important to someone who is housing insecure than to someone in a lovely house in the hills. 
* So we're free to read, and always will be, but we encourage our readers to support us financially if they can. And they do: we're at over 3,600 members now. 
* There are plenty of others who have the same core belief, from Texas Tribune to VT Digger to Bridge Magazine. 
* We're still digging!
