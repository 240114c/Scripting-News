What Trump will do is not impotent or unobvious. He decrees (say) May 10 to be the date to re-open. States that don't re-open won't get any stimulus money. If you won't help yourselves, he'll say, why should the Federal government help you? That will "make sense" to his base as they rush off to their deaths. What happens after that, I don't imagine Trump has thought through.
