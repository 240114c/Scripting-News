New <a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1586885920000">version</a> of "LO2" with a nice-to-have command that downloads all your outline and configuration files on my server onto your local computer. Now you can do a full backup whenever you like. Please use it regularly. If you have questions or comments, please post them <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/166">here</a>. I'll probably do a video of the command because it's so important.
