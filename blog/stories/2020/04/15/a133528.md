# A current-day NYC story
From a friend in the city...
* <img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/15/bagel.png" border="0" align="right">I just woke up about an hour ago, and really needing coffee and a bagel, so I put on my mask and went to my nearby bakery. Three people were inside, none wearing masks; I waited for two to leave then stepped in carefully. The remaining customer was a middle-aged woman who seemed to be speaking in great detail to the worker helping her, and getting very close to be heard, maybe 3 feet. The employees were all wearing masks (the crappy surgical mask type) but she wasn't. Then she went to pay and checkout and seemed to have another intensive conversation at 3 feet away from the employee at the register.
* I thought I probably should have said something, I was still three quarters asleep at that point, but what should I have done in that situation? Did that woman already get sick and figured she didn't need to be careful? Was she a Trump supporter who wanted to flaunt the rules? Something in-between, or just a jerk? 
* Help me figure out what I should do the next time that happens, maybe you can crowdsource this to your readers? I want to clearly communicate to that person that her mouth is a lethal weapon, and that the bakery employees didn't deserve to be "shot at" just to be paid their 12 or 15 bucks an hour... but, you know, nicely. Thanks. 
* Silver lining: that bagel was amazing, something about the 0.001% chance of dying really makes it that much better!

If you have an idea post a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/167">note here</a>. Here are a couple of mine. 
1. My fantasy answer comes from having ridden a bike in urban areas for many years. I dream of carrying a can of red spray paint with me, and when someone comes too close with their car and I have to slam on the brakes to avoid getting run over, I whip out the paint and put a red stripe on their fender or bumper. Then they would have to explain to friends and family how he got the red stripe. And shitty drivers would end up with <i>lots</i> of them.
2. I have to admit I once hit a guy's car with a stick on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@37.406063,-122.2491704,3a,75y,5.42h,91.82t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s_EmimMiikqlcJp5LPKtj1A!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3D_EmimMiikqlcJp5LPKtj1A%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D59.450317%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192">Mountain Home Road</a> in Woodside. They get very upset when you touch their car. But he was in my space, I had to move out of his way to avoid getting hit. There was no reason for it, no car on the other side of the double-yellow lines. He was either really sloppy or trying to fuck with me. He pulled over, started coming toward me, and then stopped, presumably when he saw I was much larger than him. The car gives you a sense of size-of-body that isn't realistic. I told him to get back in his car and drive away, which he did. I may have actually dreamed this, not sure.
