BTW, so far the only big limit I've learned about with Glitch is the inability to map an IP address to an app. But this may not be a problem because I use Hover as my registrar and DNS, and <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html">they can map</a> a top level domain using a CNAME. So you could say make mydomain.com point to a Glitch app.
