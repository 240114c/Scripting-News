# Glitch, day 2
Lots more info about running Glitch apps <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168">here</a>. 

BTW, so far the only big limit I've learned about with Glitch is the inability to map an IP address to an app. But this may not be a problem because I use Hover as my registrar and DNS, and <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html?title=theyCanMap">they can map</a> a top level domain using a CNAME. So you could say make mydomain.com point to a Glitch app.
