# Signed up for Medicare
I just completed signing up for Medicare including a Medicare Advantage Plan.

My two cents. When Bernie says "Medicare for All" -- no I don't think so. It's a bastard child. So incredibly complicated and convoluted. Obviously something that has been fought over endlessly in Congress. And in the end, after getting educated, and coming back again and again, I did what everyone seems to do, shrug their shoulders, pick a plan and hope for the best.

The medical system should work like this.
1. You need health care.
2. You get health care.
3. That's it.

Medicare isn't that. It's way better than I what I've had up till now. It feels like graduating, finally I get treated like I matter, a little. And I'm pretty sure that if I get in deep shit medically I wll be helped. 

But why should you have to wait until you're 65 to get that?

PS: I'm not 65 yet, but soon. :boom:
