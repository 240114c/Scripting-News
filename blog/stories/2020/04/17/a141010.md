# Glitch, day 3
Okay it took a lot of hacking, discomfort, trial and error and confusion, because the Glitch model is so different from the one I'm used to, but I did finally get a simple editor app up and running on my Glitch server. 

It's a <a href="http://macwrite.org/glitch/">variant</a> of MacWrite. Hooks up to an instance of "nodeStorage" running on the Glitch server, which in turn connects to Twitter for identity, and it stores the files in the folder Glitch gives me. This is not meant to be something useful, just a testbed to learn with.

Screen shot: Simple text editor running on Glitch.

One thing I've had trouble with is knowing when it's running what version of my app. I understand they do this for newbie programmers, so it's something they don't have to learn to get to Hello World. I would do it that way too. But as a programmer for many years, I would like to control that. Ideally from the terminal. Run the app the way I do on my Linux server. <code>node appname.js</code>.

Not sure what my next experiment will be.
