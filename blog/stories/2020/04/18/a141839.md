<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/18/thelmaLouiseLogo.png" border="0" align="right">Maybe the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66CP-pq7Cx0">best end</a> of any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_%26_Louise">movie</a> ever. It's now the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/18/thelmaLouiseEnd.png">header</a> image <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18.html">here</a>. I didn't like the picture that was there <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/26/lake.png">before</a>, but spring hasn't happened here yet, and until then I have nothing to replace it with. Thelma and Louise should be the default header here, as it is the permanent one on my <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">Twitter feed</a>. BTW, I've been meaning to say this, if you want to get the most out of this <a href="http://scripting.com/">blog</a> you should have an account on Twitter so you can, for example, go there and vote in the polls. Twitter has a useful set of functionality, and they let me use their API and identity system for $0. Pretty good deal. You don't have to do it of course. :rocket:
