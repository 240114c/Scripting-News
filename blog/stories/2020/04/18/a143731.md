I understand we're at risk of losing journalism. I propose something grand, like what we're doing with the economy and hopefully addressing the climate crisis for real, finally. Merge all the different news orgs in America, like the states are linking up at governor level, and then put your heads together and stop doing stuff that makes the problems worse, and get busy with the new reality. And stop duplicating efforts, and chasing gotchas, and making users give you their information just to give you money. Reduce friction and build a new journalism we can all be proud of.
