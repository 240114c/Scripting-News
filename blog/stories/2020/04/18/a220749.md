<a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/18/commandersPalace1976.png">Here I am at 20</a>, facing the camera in the loud jacket. My mom is on the right, grandmother on the left, brother with his back to the camera. My father probably taking the picture. This was at my college graduation in 1976 at <a href="https://www.commanderspalace.com/">Commander's Palace</a> in New Orleans. I <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/14/friendsSeeThingsYouDont.html">wrote</a> about this picture in 2009.
