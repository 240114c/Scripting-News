Question about <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. I know there have been concerns about its <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=zoom+mac+security+issues&t=h_&ia=news">security</a>. Is it safe to install on a Mac? Please answer <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1251851837898215424">on Twitter</a>. (PS: I used the browser version for the meetup and it worked well.)
