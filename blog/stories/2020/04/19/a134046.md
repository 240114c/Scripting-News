# Is the virus here?
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/19/coronavirus.png" border="0" align="right">I find it helpful to ask the question "Is the virus here?"

I thought on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/08.html">March 8</a> it must not be here yet. I had a dinner party that night. Lots of touching, no social distancing. Some people from the small town I live in, some from NYC. Should have been more careful. But it's now 41 days later, and all the guests at the party are well. So I guess we dodged a bullet. On that day.

Nowadays, when I go for a walk, or go to the market, I ask the same question and assume the answer is yes. The virus is here. How do I keep it out of my lungs. 

In server programming there's this idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taint_checking">tainted text</a>. If it came from outside the server, it could contain executable code. That's how hackers get into our systems, through tainted text. 

Now I think about packages from Amazon the same way. I have an untaint function. I leave them alone for 24 hours. I've heard that the virus will die on cardboard in 24 hours. I assume whatever is inside the box is not dirty, but I think of it as tainted too. It came from outside. It's tainted. I wash my hands after handling it. Then at some point I shrug my shoulders and bless it as part of the house, and not tainted. It's how I maintain a level of sanity.

We wrote an <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/reference/manila/macros/safeMacrosGuidelines">excellent guide</a> to being safe with macros in Frontier, many years ago. 

I find a lot of parallels between programming and epidemiology. We've been dealing with similar concepts ever since our software started communicating over the open network.
