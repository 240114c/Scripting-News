My <a href="http://pagepark.glitch.me/">server</a> on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/18/154707.html?title=glitchDay4">Glitch</a> keeps on rolling. Even with the startup delay it's nice and snappy. Still thinking about where I want to go next. I have to figure out how to get more bits of code running on one instance.
