I read a <a href="https://twitter.com/lilienfeld1/status/1251335135909122049">thread</a> yesterday from a doctor saying there wasnâ€™t enough awareness of the damage the virus causes people who survive. It's like the mass shootings. They only count those who were killed. But some people are so damaged they never get to resume anything like a normal life. We'll be living with the (still unknown) after-effects of Covid-19 for a very long time to come.
