# We got our answer
One year ago today I <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/20/151133.html">wrote</a>:
* Those who say impeach is not the answer, what would Trump have to do in order to make impeach the right answer?
* Well here's the thing, what makes you think he won't do much worse between now and inauguration day in 2021?
* He wouldn't have any restraints between now and then.
* And BTW, what constraints would there be on the next president? Maybe not such a buffoon as Trump. If we don't impeach and remove, we no longer have a Constitution that's enforced re the president. This guy has been ignoring it. We would all be ignoring it if he isn't impeached and removed.
