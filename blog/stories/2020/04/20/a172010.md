I record shows I love so I can binge-watch them on my own schedule. Last night I watched the first episode of season 5 of <a href="https://www.amc.com/shows/better-call-saul">Better Call Saul</a>. It was good of course, but the commercials are so dated. Like reading a magazine from the 1950s. The episode aired Feb 23.
