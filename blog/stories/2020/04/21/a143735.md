I was going to write a bit about Kobol vs COBOL, an ancient programming language which is in the news these days. Kobol is the homeworld of the Twelve Colonies in Battlestar Galactica. I've watched the full series twice. But the synopsis on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica">Wikipedia page</a> is riveting. I often forget how simple and beautiful the overall structure of the plot is. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/21/bsgplot.png">spoiler</span></a>. And of course the execution. I'd have to say, even though it has cheezy sets and special effects, it's pretty much a perfect multi-part scifi drama. I just watched The Expanse, which is also good, but BSG is still tops with me.
