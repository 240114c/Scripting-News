# The ebb and flow of lockdown
The way we're going to fight the virus is like levels in video games. You don't get to move on to the next level until you've mastered the previous. And when you fall down, you go back to the beginning. 

This narrative comes from listening to expert explainers on MSNBC last night, mainly <a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-pandemics-path/">Laurie Garrett</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html">Donald McNeil</a>, who was also yesterday's guest on the the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus.html">Daily</a> podcast. 
1. First, establish strategic testing. Do statistical sampling to form virus outbreak "weather reports," like tracking tornados. 
2. If you are in an area where there aren't active outbreaks, you can do a covid-aware resumption of business. Strict limits on size and density of gatherings, so new outbreaks, which will happen, are limited. Makes contact tracing possible. 
3. Where there are outbreaks, do intense contact tracing. Full lockdown except for essential services. Locate people who are infected, and isolate with other spreaders, not with their families. Until the outbreak subsides, then go to 2. 

The testing is never of the whole population. Testing is used this way to form the basis for the weather reports. We are going to get good at this, very good. 

I'm sure <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538">Nate Silver</a> can explain better and in more detail. This is similar to what they do at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/politics/">538</a> to predict election outcomes.
