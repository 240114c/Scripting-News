<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/23/phonetalker.png" border="0" align="right">Ever notice how I put images in the right margin of posts on "scripting news"? That tradition goes all the way back to the mid-90s. I'm always looking for evocative images that aren't too large, that have empty backgrounds. Imagine how happy I was when I discovered the Wee People font. A collection of silhouettes of people gesturing in easily identified ways. I admit I'm making this post extra long so there's room to put one of the images in the right margin. Please forgive me. Now I wonder which one I should use? Let's see. How about a person of indeterminate gender talking on a phone?
