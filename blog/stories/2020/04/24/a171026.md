# A milestone in American journalism 
The NYT isn't punting on whether drinking or injecting poison is bad for a human. 

They're <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1253719616603541504">taking a stand</a>.  

There aren't two sides to that, per the NYT.

No he-said-she-said. 

Not subject to alternate facts.

Let's <i>not</i> agree to disagree. 

I am not being sarcastic. This is how bad it has been. They've accepted as reality lies that have cost us dearly. Two sides to ridiculous things that are not two-sided. Finally they have been pushed to the brink of their cowardice by a psychotic president who insists that ingesting random poisons could cure a person of the disease caused by the pandemic that is consuming our country. 

The NYT and Trump were in perfect sync on the possibility of this idea being true until now. Let's hope they come to their senses and start showing a bit of the courage and integrity that they take so much credit for having. 

The Times takes a stand.
