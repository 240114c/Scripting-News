# Dropbox is killing itself
Dropbox on Linux appears to be killing itself.

When I do a "dropbox status" from the CL, it says: "Upgrading Dropbox..."

It never stops trying to upgrade itself. 

It isn't syncing while supposedly upgrading. 

I've <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Upgrading+Dropbox...%22&t=hy&ia=web">searched</a> and on various support boards that this has been happening for years for others.
