# The ridiculousness of Trump
Take a step back and think about the ridiculousness of Trump. 

The world is shut down. Economic and health collapse. 

Precarious future. We hope science is working, trying to dig us out of the mess.

But we never get updates on that. 

Just more Trump skating.

Eventually we're going to have to get down to business. 

We're all stuck in hibernation until we get down to business.

And this clown is up there being an idiot. And now everyone is looking. And day after day of idiot lectures and babbles incoherently. 

And then he talks about injecting bleach in your veins. 

How much more of this could we possibly take. 

Finally even <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/24/171026.html?title=aMilestoneInAmericanJournalism">the NYT can't see both sides</a>. 

Something broke there.
