# Warren for VP
Biden should pick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> for VP.

She'd put Repubs on notice. Biden is a nice guy but Warren knows you suck. Good cop bad cop.

A black woman? The best candidate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters">Maxine Waters</a>, isn't in contention.

Let's win, not just the election but the politcal war that will follow.
