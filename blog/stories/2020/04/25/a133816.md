# Elizabeth Warren for VP
Biden should pick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> for VP.   

She'd put Repubs on notice. Biden is a nice guy but Warren knows you suck. Good cop bad cop.

A black woman? The best candidate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters">Maxine Waters</a>, isn't in contention.

Let's win, not just the election but the politcal war that will follow.

BTW, I supported Biden over Warren after Klobuchar dropped out. I want a president that is uncontentious, for everyone. A unifier. It's the only way out of the paralysis imho. 

But I want everyone to understand the unity has as its foundation care for the American people. That's what Warren is for. No one can misunderstand what that choice means.
