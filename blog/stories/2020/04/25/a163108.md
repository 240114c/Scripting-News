# When will there be a vaccine?
Here's a splash of cold water.

We've been sort of assuming that there will be immunity and eventually a vaccine for Covid-19. 

But it may be that neither will happen.  

There isn't a <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/potential-future-options/hiv-vaccines">vaccine for HIV</a>, for example. 

It first appeared in 1984. 36 years. That would mean there would still be no vaccine in 2056.

Something to think about and ponder.

Also there's another apocalypse lurking in the shadows, other than climate change. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/about/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html">Antibiotic resistance</a>. 

Yeah science is a bitch. :boom:
