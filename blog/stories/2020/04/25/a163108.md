# When will there be a vaccine?
Here's a splash of cold water.

We've been sort of assuming that there will be immunity and eventually a vaccine for Covid-19. 

But it may be that neither will happen.

There isn't a <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/potential-future-options/hiv-vaccines">vaccine for HIV</a>, for example. 

It first appeared in 1984. 36 years. That would mean there would still be no vaccine in 2056.

Something to think about and ponder.
