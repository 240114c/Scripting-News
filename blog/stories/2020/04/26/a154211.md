I recently found out there was a season 3 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos_(season_3)">Narcos</a>. Wow. That goes on my list. Also, I thought this season was the last for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul_(season_5)">Better Call Saul</a>. Imagine my surprise when I got to the end, and nothing was resolved. Okay, I'd better survive this virus thing so I can find out what happens to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalo_Salamanca">Lalo</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a32248797/better-call-saul-stars-why-kim-isnt-in-breaking-bad/">Kim</a>.
