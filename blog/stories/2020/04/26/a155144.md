# My latest fishing expedition
Sometimes I write posts to solicit info from my brain trust, the people who read my blog. Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/25/163108.html?title=whenWillThereBeAVaccine">wrote</a> about the non-inevitablity of a Covid-19 vaccine, and got two interesting responses. 

<b>From correspondent #1</b>.
* HIV has a very high mutation rate, it's a constantly changing target, very hard to vaccinate. Fortunately this corona virus is highly conserved (stable), there are many stable proteins you can target. We don't see a reason why that <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2012889?query=featured_coronavirus">stability</a> would change as it's already spread around the world. 

<b>From correspondent #2</b>.
* I wanted to offer a few reasons for limited, cautious optimism, and one reason for a little bit of pessimism.
* But there's also one reason to worry:
* So as I understand it, the biggest question with SARS-CoV-2 isn't whether we can teach our bodies to beat it. It's how long our immune system will remember. And whether we can find a low-risk vaccine that doesn't cause other problems.
