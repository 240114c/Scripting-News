# Dropbox, LO2 outage
I had a pretty terrible <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/24/171231.html?title=dropboxIsKillingItself">Dropbox outage</a> here since Friday, but with <a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Stuck-on-quot-upgrading-dropbox-quot/m-p/414171/highlight/false#M92358">help</a> from Daniel Bradley, I was able to get most of my servers connected to Dropbox again. 

I just noticed that the server for "LO2" got completely trashed in the process. I have no idea how, but I had a backup from yesterday, which I am now restoring. It may take about an hour or so. Any work done between the outage and the restoration will be lost. Sorry. 

I'm going to have to stop depending on Dropbox. Obviously the Linux version is not a priority for them, it's breaking a lot these days. I've been a Dropbox user since the beginning. But it's been obvious for a few years that this is no longer a good match.
