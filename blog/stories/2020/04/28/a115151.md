# We create each other
In 1998 I wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/01/01/menStaySilent.html">piece</a> about gender and generalizations. 

"We create each other and together we create the world we live in." 

Today I read that <a href="https://bigthink.com/sex-relationships/dating-a-psychopath.amp.html">men with psychopathic traits</a> are more desirable to women. 

Every trait in every man was put there by an adult, and a lot of those adults were women. I can't tell you how my personality was molded and shaped by the adult women in the world I grew up in, I wasn't really conscious when it happened, but I'm sure of it. 

I'm a mirror of them, I am what they saw when they looked at me. 

I read today, from a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/annamasera/posts/10217478085568290">wise woman</a>, that we will be feeling the reverberations of this period in generations to come. 

Another wise woman, <a href="https://twitter.com/mayawiley/status/1254080040767229952">on Twitter</a>, quoted <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/411502-the-great-force-of-history-comes-from-the-fact-that">James Baldwin</a>. “The great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.” 

Exactly right.
