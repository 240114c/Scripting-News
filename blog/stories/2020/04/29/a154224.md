Jay Rosen is <a href="https://pressthink.org/2020/04/a-current-list-of-my-top-problems-in-pressthink-april-2020/">speaking clearly</a> to the journalism industry again. He's gotta stop doing that (just kidding). As a former entrepreneur, I have a bit of advice myself. Listen to your users. This, surprising to me, has been something journalism explains they don't do, presumably because it would taint their objectivity. They're humans like the rest of us and the reason is probably more that it complicates their already-complicated lives. But the answer to their problems imho lie there. Every user of news will tell you that they aren't going to subscribe to every news org they're interested in. There must be some profitable relationship short of committment that will get our money into your bank account. Yet that's exactly how the industry has configured itself as if every pub has a reasonable shot of being funded this way. Listen to users, followed by a negotiation -- that's where the answer lies. Also change your mission now to saving lives. As I've said before if you save my life I'm going to shower you with money. I'm going to <i>drown</i> you with money. It's never been easier to do that, btw. Changing times call for new ideas.
