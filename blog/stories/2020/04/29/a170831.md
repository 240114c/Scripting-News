Problems with the <a href="http://this.how/cuomo/">Cuomo podcast</a> in Apple's podcasts app? I have subscribed to it, of course, but it hasn't updated since the Boris Johnson special. But it keeps floating to the top of the list, and indicates that it has updated, but no new episodes show up. Yesterday I saw a complaint from a user about this. What's going wrong? We go to the trouble of updating <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cuomo-podcast/id1506413883">this</a> podcast feed every day with the latest Cuomo briefing, but if people aren't hearing it, what's the point? If you have a comment please post it <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1255545583466614784">here</a> on Twitter.
