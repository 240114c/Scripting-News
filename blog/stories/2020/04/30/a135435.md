Earlier today I went grocery shopping and was surprised at how well-stocked the store was. They actually had <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/handSanitizer.png">hand sanitizer</a> and Lysol cleaning stuff. And I was sure all the meat would have gone, given the problems with meat processing plants in the midwest, but not so. The <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/checkoutLine.png">checkout line</a> was ridiculously long, but moved quickly. All in all a gratifying experience. PS: I was really scared to do this.
