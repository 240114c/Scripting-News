<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/voila.png" border="0" align="right">On Twitter it was <a href="https://twitter.com/bloatedlesbian/status/1255697398485180418">suggested</a> that I change the titles of the items in the Cuomo Briefing podcast <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml">feed</a> so each item has a unique title, that it might start working properly in Apple's podcasts app on my iPhone. Note the items in the feed have <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/feedHasGuidsAsYouCanSee.png">proper guid elements</a>, so there should be no need to use the title as a guid, but it seems that Apple's podcast app does, because when I changed the titles of the five most recent episode, voila -- they show up in the Apple podcasts app. This was suggested on Twitter by OG podcaster <a href="https://twitter.com/bloatedlesbian/status/1255697398485180418">Madge Weinstein</a>. Bottom-line: there appears to be an easy-to-fix bug in Apple's podcasts app on iOS.
