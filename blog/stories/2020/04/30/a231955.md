I did a little checking after posting <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/28.html#a220729">this</a>, and it seems <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">request</a> is <i>not</i> being deprecated. Rather, they are <a href="https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142">freezing</a> it. Totally legit. But it's safe to keep using it, which is exactly what I plan to do. If they ever take it out, I'm just going to fork it and add it back. I have enough complications to manage in the <s>messes</s> functionality I've created.
