# Sally's leaves
By Sally Anderson, Seattle.

How she did it: "Just tapped on the iPhone screen and raised brightness before shooting (not a filter or edit). Also - craned my neck full tilt to see a beloved tree coming into spring foliage and saw how beautiful its nubile leaves against today's half-lit sky."
