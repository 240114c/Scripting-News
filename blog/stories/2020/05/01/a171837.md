# Glitch update
I was emailing with Anil Dash about <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. Learned a few things.
* The GitHub integration is still early. The problem is that when you update from a repo, it wipes out all the other files in the project. The data and settings. But that's going to be fixed, he says, and when it is I will be able to connect to a project through the GitHub version.  
* Also good to know is that you can change which files cause the app to restart by adding a <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/watch-json?path=README.md%3A1%3A0">watch.json file</a> to the project. 

Also my test server, <a href="http://pagepark.glitch.me/">pagepark.glitch.me</a>, is still running. A reminder that my stack (still) works there. Node is a good platform. 

If the Glitch folk can answer the other questions I asked here in <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/">April</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168">thread</a> on GitHub is a good place to go.
