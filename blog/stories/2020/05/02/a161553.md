I've heard it said of countries like South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam that they had a bad experience with H1N1 or swine flu, and didn't want to repeat it with CV. Their people had experienced a pandemic, and therefore motivated to believe there was a problem before there were massive infections. This is why imho it's been so bad in the US, this is our first experience with such a bad virus since 1918. No one alive remembers it.
