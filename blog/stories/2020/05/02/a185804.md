On March 12, I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/12.html#a174026">pointed</a> to the day's Daily podcast with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr">Donald McNeil</a> from the NYT re "the tragedy of America's non-response to the virus." I just listened to an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/29/847870532/what-the-u-s-might-learn-from-chinas-approach-to-covid-19">episode</a> of Fresh Air from <i>this week, </i>in late April, with McNeil telling <i>exactly the same story</i> about how we're not fighting the virus, the same story he told in March. I could finish his sentences. The interviewer asks the same dumb questions they all do, when will the lockdown end, what will it be like when we resume life. The frustration McNeil feels, and I feel, having heard the same story at least four times, the questions assume that all we have to do is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/penance">penance</a>, stay home for a while, and we will be able to go back to normal, having done our time. This is what Trump seems to think too, and the other Repubs. Maybe some Dems. That's not it.
