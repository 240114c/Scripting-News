# Bill Gates fights for science
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/26/billGatesHead.png" border="0" align="right">It's been a long time since <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22bill+gates%22">Bill Gates</a> and I were in the same industry. I always respected his mind and drive. He once tried to buy my company, but then changed his mind. But I've done well, I've achieved most of my goals -- but always wonder -- what if I had been at Microsoft in the late 80s and 90s. Would I have been able to create <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">Frontier</a>? If I had, it probably would have had more lasting impact. And what about when the web came along, would I have been able to convince Gates, from within Microsoft, not to try to own it? 

Eventually, through the power of the web, I was able to at least chronicle the fight between open and corporate platforms, a story in which Gates was a major character, maybe <i>the</i> major character. 
* It wasn't <i>just</i> Microsoft though. Apple's story, how the web was the end of the road for Apple's big vision, the ouster and then return of <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/03/gatesJobs.png">Steve Jobs</a>. And there was Netscape, and John Doerr, Google and Amazon. It was a good story with lots of drama. 

We often wait to say the good things about people until they're gone and can't hear it. I just wanted to say about Bill Gates, he's doing good now. Standing up for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/02/bill-gates-coronavirus-science/">science</a> at a time when that can save a lot of lives, maybe even save our civilization. He doesn't have to take a risk now, he could, like other super rich people, isolate himself perfectly and ride out the storm quietly. Instead he's put himself out there, standing for what's right, and you know what, <i>that's good, </i>and thanks to him for doing that.
