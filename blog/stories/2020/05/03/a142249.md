# Bill Gates fights for science
We often wait to say the good things about people until they're gone and can't hear it. I just wanted to say about Bill Gates, he's doing good now. Standing up for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/02/bill-gates-coronavirus-science/">science</a> at a time when that can save a lot of lives, maybe even save our civilization. He doesn't have to take a risk now, he could, like other super rich people, isolate himself perfectly and ride out the storm quietly. Instead he's put himself out there, standing for what's right, and you know what, <i>that's good, </i>and thanks to him for doing that.
