<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/30/voila.png" border="0" align="right">Now that the <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/30.html#a142426">Apple is happy</a> with the <a href="http://this.how/cuomo/">Cuomo podcast</a>, it's really nice the way it updates so quickly in the Podcasts app on my iPhone. A few seconds after a new episode is available, the podcast moves to the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/05/applePodcastsAppScreenShot.png">top of the list</a> and it starts downloading the new episode. I wonder how they do it. Is my iPhone polling the feed constantly? Is Apple's server and relaying the notice to all subscribed clients? Or perhaps they hook into the <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/06/02/rsscloudDomains.html">rssCloud</a> functionality that the feed supports (part of RSS 2.0). That would be the best answer.
