# My backups
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/syquest.png" border="0" align="right">I had a storage unit in Berkeley with all kinds of random stuff in it. When I moved to the new house in the mountains, I had a lot of room, so I had the storage unit contents moved out here. There were a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/diskbackups1.png">couple</a> of <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/07/diskbackups2.png">cartons</a> of backups from Living Videotext and UserLand in the 80s and 90s.

I don't have hardware to read any of them, but I'd love to back them up somewhere like the Computer History Museum, or Stanford or MIT, or where ever it makes sense. Happy to make it all open source. I always intended to leave a record behind of some kind. 

Send me an email if you have any pointers. I would be willing to drive to Boston or NYC if people know where there's hardware. Of course when it's safe to do so, from a virus standpoint. 

This reminds me of a project we did with <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/15/uncleArnosBooks.html">Uncle Arno's books</a> a number of years ago. We did find a home for them at Portland State University. This is different, this is all digital stuff.
