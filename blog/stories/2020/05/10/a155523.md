# United flight crammed
In a <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1259165939037331456">thread</a> on Twitter, Ethan Weiss, who was with a group of 25 nurses and doctors working in NYC hospitals for the past 2-4 weeks, explained. They are going home. He says United flew them there for free, got lots of great PR, and took <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1254197942732324867">great care</a> of them going out. 

United wrote them <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1259171771191824385">10 days ago</a> to say the middle seats would all be empty. Clearly they are not empty.

This is the <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanjweiss/status/1259310067066630144/photo/1">departure board</a> for United at Newark yesterday. 

I think this is what everyone fears about flying. 

The United Airlines flight yesterday.
