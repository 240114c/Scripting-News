# <i>ALEXA!</i>
I use my kitchen Alexa only to listen to WNYC. 

Usually I say <i>Alexa WNYC</i> and it works.

Now I have to say it slowly and loudly, being sure thereâ€™s no other sound. It takes 3 or more tries.

It's getting worse.

But when I say <i>Alexa stop</i> it works every time.

What's wrong?
