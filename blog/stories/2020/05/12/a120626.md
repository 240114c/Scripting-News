There was a <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/05/10/heads_up_to_rss_reader_authors">kerfuffle</a> in the "RSS" world yesterday when it appeared that Apple wanted aggregator developers to get written permission from sites whose feeds they include as defaults. It appears this was an error, or Apple changed their mind. Also, I love the word <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=kerfuffle">kerfuffle</a>. Surprisingly, it's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kerfuffle">not the first time</a> I've used it, according to Google. I'm surprised. But it appears to be the first time <i>in 13 years. </i>
