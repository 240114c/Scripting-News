Be prepared to change your thinking on how divided the country is because that appears to be changing. Polls show that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/13/class-war-over-social-distancing-new-data-suggests-otherwise/?fbclid=IwAR2pJHnNSv4PsX8yxY8duV5NaKCwIruUq-XyJOW5iKCUvykPbwvJp0MTJTY">80% support wearing masks</a>. That includes a large part of Trump's base. I think, as the reality of the situation sinks in, and it will, and the stakes seen as very real, we will change as a country. At least be prepared to see it if it happens as it appears to be happening now. Catastrophes like this unify us.
