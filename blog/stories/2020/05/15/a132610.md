In news everything is a race between two political parties. The reds and the blues. I have the perspective of a citizen: voter, taxpayer, juror, soldier (according to the president), and now -- infected, transmitting, part of a death toll. Yesterday's <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/politics/coronavirus-whistleblower-testimony/index.html">testimony</a> by Rick Bright wasn't so much a scandal as it was a clear statement of what was already obvious, that the US government isn't doing anything to "save my life". That should have been the headline.
