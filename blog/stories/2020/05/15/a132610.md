There are other perspectives, for example I have the perspective of a citizen: voter, taxpayer, juror, soldier (according to the president), and now -- possibly infected, transmitting, part of a death toll. Yesterday's <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/politics/coronavirus-whistleblower-testimony/index.html">testimony</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bright">Rick Bright</a> wasn't just a scandal, as much of journalism characterized it, it was also a clear statement that the US government isn't doing anything to "save my life". That should have been the headline. We are being rolled over by a killer. <i>No one is driving the bus. </i>
