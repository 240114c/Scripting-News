I've heard it said that the lockdown in NYC hasn't been very complete, but look at this <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/16/timesSquare.png">snapshot</a> of a Times Square <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKjNfj3ZVXw">webcam</a> at 1:40PM on a sunny warm Saturday in May. First question I'd ask is how did they do it?
