# Bike ride notes
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/16/bike.png" border="0" align="right">Huge number of sirens near my house in the country earlier this afternoon. Really frightening and weird. Later on my daily ride, I figured out what it was. There were signs on the road about a birthday celebration. Obviously all the emergency vehicles were wishing the person a happy birthday. It was a huge demonstration. I speak from having lived in midtown Manhattan, how surprising to hear something so loud, like that in the country. When I was trying to figure out what it was earlier the only thing I could think of was that there had been a terrorist attack, a very large one. But here? In the middle of nowhere? It's not a good thing to disturb the peace like that, especially in such a peaceful place.

Also on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4ev-H_XBQQ">ride</a> today I came across a lot of walkers and riders, I was the <i>only one</i> wearing a mask. That's not a good feeling, gotta say -- I did my part to protect them, but they didn't reciprocate. Not one person wearing a mask.
