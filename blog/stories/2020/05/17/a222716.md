There's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/17/cuomoPodcastImage.png">new graphic</a> for the <a href="http://this.how/cuomo/">Cuomo Briefing Podcast</a>. I thought about putting some text on it, but decided a simple color picture of the governor was sufficient. If people want to give it a try, send me your version. I'm totally open to improvements. BTW <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/04/cuomoBriefing.png">this</a> is the original version.
