An observation about servers on Node.js. Node is optimized for servers to run services like Google and Facebook where they support billions of users and they don't revise the core software very often. But Node is most often used by services that hundreds or thousands of users. Tradeoffs are everything in software. There should be popular server software, based on JavaScript, that creates more reliable, debuggable, easier to write servers, for the loads people really have.
