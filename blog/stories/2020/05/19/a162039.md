# Programming milestone
I just got something neat working, "PagePark" integrated with <a href="https://github.com/foreversd/forever#readme">Forever</a>. So now I can create a sub-folder of the domains folder, and put a Node app in it. PagePark will see it when it boots, and launch the app with Forever, running as a package, with no UI. PagePark tells it what port to run on via <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-process-env-PORT-in-Node-js">process.env.PORT</a>, which is a standard. That's how PagePark, which is foremost an HTTP server, knows how to route requests to the app. 

I've always suspected this is where Forever belongs, but it took a few iterations over a couple of years to get to this place. The pieces all snap in place. 

Further, I did it on a server without Dropbox running on it. The Linux version of Dropbox appears to be an unmaintained mess. It feels so much more solid not depending on it.
