<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/santa.png" border="0" align="right">I was talking with an old software developer friend <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22don+park%22&t=hk&ia=web">Don Park</a> yesterday. First project we did together was in 1988. He did a <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/10/15.html#a141614">Mac INIT</a> that enabled interprocess communication. It was part of the foundation we built Frontier on. We got around to JavaScript and he said I should make packages anyone can use. I said Don I do! No one knows about them, he said. Yeah, but I tell them. Heh. Maybe I should be doing PR. Finding the bloggers who are most influential about new packages that make JavaScript developers lives easier. Anyway, to start, I <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1262801291597791235">sent</a> Don a pointer to my <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedRead#what-is-this">davefeedread package</a>. It's a Node package that makes it <i>easy</i> and fast to read a feed. Any flavor of RSS or Atom. GIve it a URL and it calls back with a JavaScript object for the whole feed. Includes a simple example, sort of a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedRead/blob/master/examples/readurl/read.js">Hello World of feed reading</a>. What you do from there is up to your imagination. It's the easiest way to read a feed in Node. A good place to start. :boom:
