# State of the Virus
Here's where we're at with the virus in mid-May 2020.

Top line: It makes no sense to "reopen" from the lockdown in the US.

The purpose of the lockdown was to freeze everything so we could get our act together. To monitor outbreaks of the virus the same way we track the weather. It's not the testing itself that's so important, it's the weather report. There are other methods, like sampling the sewage a community creates for virus. 

Once an outbreak happens we lock that community down, the same way people would shelter if there were tornoados forecast or a blizzard, or fires like the ones they have in California and Australia. How long do they stay locked down? Until the outbreak is over. 

We also need the ability to isolate people who are infected and shedding. Sending them back to their family just means the family members are likely to get infected. That feeds the outbreak. 

In the US, none of this is working, we can't track outbreaks, there is no weather report. We can't isolate people who are infected. We're still at the beginning, more or less we were in March, though the virus is distributed all around the country now. Most people don't know how dangerous the virus is. We're going to have to hit the wall repeatedly until the people understand how this works. Countries in Asia had an advantage, they had to deal with recent pandemics that never made it to the US, presumably because our health systems and political leaders kept us safe without us being aware. 

We're reopening because we don't know better. Our government included. There will be new spikes, more sickness, incapacity, death. The economy will go into a deeper recession, and will be harder to recover from.
