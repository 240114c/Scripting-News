<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/15/broccoli.png" border="0" align="right">I have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Forester">Subaru Forester</a>. Nice car. But every so often the rear door refuses to open. Three beeps. So I <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=subaru+forester+open+rear+gate&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=subaru+forester+open+rear+gate&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l6j69i61.12667j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">search</a>, have trouble finding an answer. So confusing, they talk about buttons my car doesn't seem to have. Anyway it turns out if you hold the touch point for six seconds it'll open the rear door. Software glitch of some kind. From then on it works as normal. Wonder what the logic is. If it has the means to reset itself why doesn't it just reset itself without me having to jump through hoops?
