# Listening to the virus
The latest save my life <a href="https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/534/just-this-breath">story</a> (must-read) makes me wonder how to listen to people we support. People who are suffering. What conclusions to draw from what they say? 

This is part of the "we're going to have to learn to live with it" approach, which is another part of "save my life". It's not only about medicine, math, politics, money and power -- it's also about individual people who need -- what? How can we help? How to listen? How can we help? What to say? And how can we help?

The author wasn't able to convey her condition to the first doctor over the phone. I wanted to know how the doctor could do better. Also how the doctor could have made a difference when there was no treatment, at the time -- not sure if there's treatment possible now, even.

It's about more than science. It's about us.
