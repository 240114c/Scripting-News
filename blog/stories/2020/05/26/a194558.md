# Bug reports, not pull requests
My basic philosophy on software: If you spot a mistake, I want to know about it so I can fix it. Always. 

Now here's the background: I share most of the software I write as open source <a href="https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories">on GitHub</a>. Sometimes people report bugs by submitting <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull requests</a>. That doesn't work out very well because I write my code in an outliner, and it generates the JavaScript code from the outline. So what you see as source on GitHub actually isn't what I edit. I couldn't accept a pull request to the generated code. It would just be wiped out the next time I made a change to the outline and re-generated. 

So the best thing to do when you spot a mistake is flag it as an issue in the repo, point to the code in question if that's helpful, and I'll thank you and make the fix myself.
