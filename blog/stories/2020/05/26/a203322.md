# GitHub, platform for time capsules
An idea..

Microsoft owns GitHub.

When I post a project to GH, I'm hoping I'm preserving that work for a long time. As long as MS exists? Would be cool.

This is something MS could market. Think of the repos at GH as time capsules. 

Tech can be imaginative. Like this. ;-)

PS: Chad Tolkien <a href="https://twitter.com/c_tolkien/status/1265381771572469760">says</a> they are <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">planning</a> on it, but it's only for some projects. So it's going to have a Microsoft bias. Oy. I want to send my stuff into the future so they can use it as prior art for the software they'll be doing then.
