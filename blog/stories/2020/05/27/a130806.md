# Where did RSS come from?
On Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/ejoep/status/1265522849973927940">Joe Pezillo says</a> he's pretty sure Dave Winer (me) got the idea for "RSS" from Newton. He's also pretty sure I won't admit it. He's wrong on the first count, and right on the second. :smile:

I wrote a tweet that was too long to fit in 280 chars that lists the steps that led to what we think of as RSS today. It wasn't an <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/11/didYouInventRss.html">invention</a> as most people think of invention, it was more of a synthesis, one idea leading to another and then another. 
* It started with seeing <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/14/cnnonyourdesktop.html">Pointcast</a>, being blown away by the idea. 
* Then a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/11/25/Thanksgiving1997.html#4">guy</a> from Microsoft wanted me to do something with XML, so I turned my <a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$11">blog into a feed</a>.
* Then Netscape reinvented what I did.
* Then I said OK let's do it your way. 
* Then someone leaked me the XML feeds for the NYT.
* Then I repurposed them and published them so people could use them from Radio UserLand. 
* Then they shut me down (with respect). 
* Then they offered to let me have them for free.
* Then we turned them into RSS feeds. 

And thus was born what we now think of as RSS.
