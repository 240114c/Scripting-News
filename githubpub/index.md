# This is a test

It serves content from a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/githubpub">folder</a> in a GitHub repository. This page is of course <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/gitpub/test.md">written</a> in Markdown. It's something I'm playing around with to see how much of a CMS we can make out of GitHub. For right now it's very simple. And maybe it will stay simple. Or maybe it'll get a ton of features. It's anyone's guess. 

That was fun! :-)
