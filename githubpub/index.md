# Welcome to githubpub!

This page is used in testing the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/githubpub">githubpub</a> package. 

It serves content from a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/githubpub">folder</a> in a GitHub repository. 

This page is of course <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/githubpub/index.md">written</a> in Markdown. 

It's something I'm playing around with to see how much of a CMS we can make out of GitHub. For right now it's very simple. And maybe it will stay simple. Or maybe it'll get a ton of features. It's anyone's guess. :-)

Now let's see if it can <a href="porky.png">serve</a> an image.

For more info, check out the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/githubpub/blob/master/README.md">readme</a>.
