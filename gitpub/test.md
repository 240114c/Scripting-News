## This is a test

This page is used in testing the git-pub package. 

It serves content from a GitHub repository. It's something I'm playing around with to see how much of a CMS we can make out of GitHub. For right now it's very simple. And maybe it will stay simple. Or maybe it'll get a shitload of features. It's anyone's guess. 

Okay, now here's a picture:

That was fun! :-)
