## How tweets are represented in the Scripting News feed

I just posted two items to Scripting News that were less than 140 chars, so I tweeted them. Information about the tweet is recorded in the feed item, as part of the &lt;source:outline> element for each item. 

A reader can take note of this information and possibly link to the tweet along with all the other data it displays about the item. 

I've pulled out both items <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/d13066d6a6a21715721c13f2ce5404f9">into this gist</a> as examples.
