## How tweets are represented in the Scripting News feed

I just posted two items to Scripting News that were less than 140 chars, so I tweeted them. Information about the tweet is recorded in the feed item, as part of the &lt;source:outline> element for each item. 

<code>&lt;source:outline type="tweet" tweetId="880064303042371584" tweetUserName="davewiner" text="So Phil Jackson is finally gone. Now to find a replacement for Dolan. A consolation prize for DJ Trump? Bloomberg? Jeff Bezos?" created="Wed, 28 Jun 2017 14:02:40 GMT" /></code>

A reader can take note of this information and possibly link to the tweet along with all the other data it displays about the item. 

I've pulled out both items <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/d13066d6a6a21715721c13f2ce5404f9">into this gist</a> as examples.
